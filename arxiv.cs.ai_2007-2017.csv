"We investigate how to model exchangeability with choice functions. Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. We show how such assessments are a special indifference assessment, and how that leads to a counterpart of de Finetti's Representation Theorem, both in a finite and a countable context.",0
"It has been proposed that human physical reasoning consists largely of running ""physics engines in the head"" in which the future trajectory of the physical system under consideration is computed precisely using accurate scientific theories. In such models, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge is dealt with by sampling probabilistically over the space of possible trajectories (""Monte Carlo simulation""). We argue that such simulation-based models are too weak, in that there are many important aspects of human physical reasoning that cannot be carried out this way, or can only be carried out very inefficiently; and too strong, in that humans make large systematic errors that the models cannot account for. We conclude that simulation-based reasoning makes up at most a small part of a larger system that encompasses a wide range of additional cognitive processes.",0
Leaf vein forms the basis of leaf characterization and classification. Different species have different leaf vein patterns. It is seen that leaf vein segmentation will help in maintaining a record of all the leaves according to their specific pattern of veins thus provide an effective way to retrieve and store information regarding various plant species in database as well as provide an effective means to characterize plants on the basis of leaf vein structure which is unique for every species. The algorithm proposes a new way of segmentation of leaf veins with the use of Odd Gabor filters and the use of morphological operations for producing a better output. The Odd Gabor filter gives an efficient output and is robust and scalable as compared with the existing techniques as it detects the fine fiber like veins present in leaves much more efficiently.,0
Current approaches to the engineering of space software such as satellite control systems are based around the development of feedback controllers using packages such as MatLab's Simulink toolbox. These provide powerful tools for engineering real time systems that adapt to changes in the environment but are limited when the controller itself needs to be adapted.,0
"Progressive filtering is a simple way to perform hierarchical classification, inspired by the behavior that most humans put into practice while attempting to categorize an item according to an underlying taxonomy. Each node of the taxonomy being associated with a different category, one may visualize the categorization process by looking at the item going downwards through all the nodes that accept it as belonging to the corresponding category. This paper is aimed at modeling the progressive filtering technique from a probabilistic perspective, in a hierarchical text categorization setting. As a result, the designer of a system based on progressive filtering should be facilitated in the task of devising, training, and testing it.",0
"We want to build robots that are useful in unstructured real world applications, such as doing work in the household. Grasping in particular is an important skill in this domain, yet it remains a challenge. One of the key hurdles is handling unexpected changes or motion in the objects being grasped and kinematic noise or other errors in the robot. This paper proposes an approach to learning a closed-loop controller for robotic grasping that dynamically guides the gripper to the object. We use a wrist-mounted sensor to acquire depth images in front of the gripper and train a convolutional neural network that directly learns the value function for grasp pose candidates. The training sensor data is generated in simulation, a major advantage over previous work that uses real robot experience, which is costly to obtain. Despite being trained in simulation, our approach works well on real noisy sensor images. We compare our controller in simulated and real robot experiments to a strong baseline for grasp pose detection, and find that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in the presence of kinematic noise, perceptual errors and disturbances of the object during grasping.",0
"Korf, Reid, and Edelkamp introduced a formula to predict the number of nodes IDA* will expand on a single iteration for a given consistent heuristic, and experimentally demonstrated that it could make very accurate predictions. In this paper we show that, in addition to requiring the heuristic to be consistent, their formulas predictions are accurate only at levels of the brute-force search tree where the heuristic values obey the unconditional distribution that they defined and then used in their formula. We then propose a new formula that works well without these requirements, i.e., it can make accurate predictions of IDA*s performance for inconsistent heuristics and if the heuristic values in any level do not obey the unconditional distribution. In order to achieve this we introduce the conditional distribution of heuristic values which is a generalization of their unconditional heuristic distribution. We also provide extensions of our formula that handle individual start states and the augmentation of IDA* with bidirectional pathmax (BPMX), a technique for propagating heuristic values when inconsistent heuristics are used. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of our new method and all its variations.",0
"An exhaustive study on neural network language modeling (NNLM) is performed in this paper. Different architectures of basic neural network language models are described and examined. A number of different improvements over basic neural network language models, including importance sampling, word classes, caching and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN), are studied separately, and the advantages and disadvantages of every technique are evaluated. Then, the limits of neural network language modeling are explored from the aspects of model architecture and knowledge representation. Part of the statistical information from a word sequence will loss when it is processed word by word in a certain order, and the mechanism of training neural network by updating weight matrixes and vectors imposes severe restrictions on any significant enhancement of NNLM. For knowledge representation, the knowledge represented by neural network language models is the approximate probabilistic distribution of word sequences from a certain training data set rather than the knowledge of a language itself or the information conveyed by word sequences in a natural language. Finally, some directions for improving neural network language modeling further is discussed.",0
"Based on a weighted knowledge graph to represent first-order knowledge and combining it with a probabilistic model, we propose a methodology for the creation of a medical knowledge network (MKN) in medical diagnosis. When a set of symptoms is activated for a specific patient, we can generate a ground medical knowledge network composed of symptom nodes and potential disease nodes. By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN. In order to deal with numerical symptoms, a multivariate inference model is presented that uses conditional probability. In addition, the weights for the knowledge graph were efficiently learned from manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs). In our experiments, we found numerically that the optimum choice of the quality of disease node and the expression of symptom variable can improve the effectiveness of medical diagnosis. Our experimental results comparing a Markov logic network and the logistic regression algorithm on an actual CEMR database indicate that our method holds promise and that MKN can facilitate studies of intelligent diagnosis.",0
"Motivated by concerns for user privacy, we design a steganographic system (""stegosystem"") that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages without an adversary detecting that such an exchange is taking place. We propose a new linguistic stegosystem based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We demonstrate our approach on the Twitter and Enron email datasets and show that it yields high-quality steganographic text while significantly improving capacity (encrypted bits per word) relative to the state-of-the-art.",1
"While recent neural encoder-decoder models have shown great promise in modeling open-domain conversations, they often generate dull and generic responses. Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the decoder at word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. Finally, the training procedure is improved by introducing a bag-of-word loss. Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence in discourse-level decision-making.",1
"Deep Neural Networks often require good regularizers to generalize well. Dropout is one such regularizer that is widely used among Deep Learning practitioners. Recent work has shown that Dropout can also be viewed as performing Approximate Bayesian Inference over the network parameters. In this work, we generalize this notion and introduce a rich family of regularizers which we call Generalized Dropout. One set of methods in this family, called Dropout++, is a version of Dropout with trainable parameters. Classical Dropout emerges as a special case of this method. Another member of this family selects the width of neural network layers. Experiments show that these methods help in improving generalization performance over Dropout.",0
"The paper introduces a new modular action language, ALM, and illustrates the methodology of its use. It is based on the approach of Gelfond and Lifschitz (1993; 1998) in which a high-level action language is used as a front end for a logic programming system description. The resulting logic programming representation is used to perform various computational tasks. The methodology based on existing action languages works well for small and even medium size systems, but is not meant to deal with larger systems that require structuring of knowledge. ALM is meant to remedy this problem. Structuring of knowledge in ALM is supported by the concepts of module (a formal description of a specific piece of knowledge packaged as a unit), module hierarchy, and library, and by the division of a system description of ALM into two parts: theory and structure. A theory consists of one or more modules with a common theme, possibly organized into a module hierarchy based on a dependency relation. It contains declarations of sorts, attributes, and properties of the domain together with axioms describing them. Structures are used to describe the domain's objects. These features, together with the means for defining classes of a domain as special cases of previously defined ones, facilitate the stepwise development, testing, and readability of a knowledge base, as well as the creation of knowledge representation libraries. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",0
"Designing appropriate features for acoustic event recognition tasks is an active field of research. Expressive features should both improve the performance of the tasks and also be interpret-able. Currently, heuristically designed features based on the domain knowledge requires tremendous effort in hand-crafting, while features extracted through deep network are difficult for human to interpret. In this work, we explore the experience guided learning method for designing acoustic features. This is a novel hybrid approach combining both domain knowledge and purely data driven feature designing. Based on the procedure of log Mel-filter banks, we design a filter bank learning layer. We concatenate this layer with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. After training the network, the weight of the filter bank learning layer is extracted to facilitate the design of acoustic features. We smooth the trained weight of the learning layer and re-initialize it in filter bank learning layer as audio feature extractor. For the environmental sound recognition task based on the Urban- sound8K dataset, the experience guided learning leads to a 2% accuracy improvement compared with the fixed feature extractors (the log Mel-filter bank). The shape of the new filter banks are visualized and explained to prove the effectiveness of the feature design process.",0
"A time series consists of a series of values or events obtained over repeated measurements in time. Analysis of time series represents and important tool in many application areas, such as stock market analysis, process and quality control, observation of natural phenomena, medical treatments, etc. A vital component in many types of time-series analysis is the choice of an appropriate distance/similarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with the most successful ones based on dynamic programming. Being of quadratic time complexity, however, global constraints are often employed to limit the search space in the matrix during the dynamic programming procedure, in order to speed up computation. Furthermore, it has been reported that such constrained measures can also achieve better accuracy. In this paper, we investigate two representative time-series distance/similarity measures based on dynamic programming, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and the effects of global constraints on them. Through extensive experiments on a large number of time-series data sets, we demonstrate how global constrains can significantly reduce the computation time of DTW and LCS. We also show that, if the constraint parameter is tight enough (less than 10-15% of time-series length), the constrained measure becomes significantly different from its unconstrained counterpart, in the sense of producing qualitatively different 1-nearest neighbor graphs. This observation explains the potential for accuracy gains when using constrained measures, highlighting the need for careful tuning of constraint parameters in order to achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy.",0
"In this series of notes, we try to model neural networks as as discretizations of continuous flows on the space of data, which can be called flow model. The idea comes from an observation of their similarity in mathematical structures. This conceptual analogy has not been proven useful yet, but it seems interesting to explore.",0
"Software capable of improving itself has been a dream of computer scientists since the inception of the field. In this work we provide definitions for Recursively Self-Improving software, survey different types of self-improving software, review the relevant literature, analyze limits on computation restricting recursive self-improvement and introduce RSI Convergence Theory which aims to predict general behavior of RSI systems. Finally, we address security implications from self-improving intelligent software.",0
"Explanations have been introduced in the previous century. Their interest in reducing the search space is no longer questioned. Yet, their efficient implementation into CSP solver is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce ESeR, an Event Selection Rules algorithm that filters events generated during propagation. This dynamic selection enables an efficient computation of explanations for intelligent backtracking al- gorithms. We show the effectiveness of our approach on the instances of the last three MiniZinc challenges",0
"This paper introduces a self-organizing traffic signal system for an urban road network. The key elements of this system are agents that control traffic signals at intersections. Each agent uses an interval microscopic traffic model to predict effects of its possible control actions in a short time horizon. The executed control action is selected on the basis of predicted delay intervals. Since the prediction results are represented by intervals, the agents can recognize and suspend those control actions, whose positive effect on the performance of traffic control is uncertain. Evaluation of the proposed traffic control system was performed in a simulation environment. The simulation experiments have shown that the proposed approach results in an improved performance, particularly for non-uniform traffic streams.",0
"Model generation is a problem complementary to theorem proving and is important for fault analysis and debugging of formal specifications of security protocols, programs and terminological definitions. This paper discusses several ways of enhancing the paradigm of bottom-up model generation. The two main contributions are new, generalized blocking techniques and a new range-restriction transformation. The blocking techniques are based on simple transformations of the input set together with standard equality reasoning and redundancy elimination techniques. These provide general methods for finding small, finite models. The range-restriction transformation refines existing transformations to range-restricted clauses by carefully limiting the creation of domain terms. All possible combinations of the introduced techniques and classical range-restriction were tested on the clausal problems of the TPTP Version 6.0.0 with an implementation based on the SPASS theorem prover using a hyperresolution-like refinement. Unrestricted domain blocking gave best results for satisfiable problems showing it is a powerful technique indispensable for bottom-up model generation methods. Both in combination with the new range-restricting transformation, and the classical range-restricting transformation, good results have been obtained. Limiting the creation of terms during the inference process by using the new range restricting transformation has paid off, especially when using it together with a shifting transformation. The experimental results also show that classical range restriction with unrestricted blocking provides a useful complementary method. Overall, the results showed bottom-up model generation methods were good for disproving theorems and generating models for satisfiable problems, but less efficient than SPASS in auto mode for unsatisfiable problems.",0
"In this paper we describe a framework for model-based diagnosis of dynamic systems, which extends previous work in this field by using and expressing temporal uncertainty in the form of qualitative interval relations a la Allen. Based on a logical framework extended by qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints we show how to describe behavioral models (both consistency- and abductive-based), discuss how to use abstract observations and show how abstract temporal diagnoses are computed. This yields an expressive framework, which allows the representation of complex temporal behavior allowing us to represent temporal uncertainty. Due to its abstraction capabilities computation is made independent of the number of observations and time points in a temporal setting. An example of hepatitis diagnosis is used throughout the paper.",0
"This work deals with the problem of combining reactive features, such as the ability to respond to events and define complex events, with the execution of transactions over general Knowledge Bases (KBs).",0
"Performing effective preference-based data retrieval requires detailed and preferentially meaningful structurized information about the current user as well as the items under consideration. A common problem is that representations of items often only consist of mere technical attributes, which do not resemble human perception. This is particularly true for integral items such as movies or songs. It is often claimed that meaningful item features could be extracted from collaborative rating data, which is becoming available through social networking services. However, there is only anecdotal evidence supporting this claim; but if it is true, the extracted information could very valuable for preference-based data retrieval. In this paper, we propose a methodology to systematically check this common claim. We performed a preliminary investigation on a large collection of movie ratings and present initial evidence.",0
The domain model is one of the important components used by adaptive learning systems to automatically generate customized courses for the learners. In this paper our contribution is to propose a new tool for implementation of a domain model based on fuzzy relationships among concepts. This tool allows the experts and teachers to find the best parameters in order to adapt the learners's differences.,0
"The rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm for a subclass of QSAT, i.e. (1, 2)-QSAT, has been proposed in the literature. (1, 2)-QSAT, first introduced in SAT'08, can be seen as quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. Until now, within our knowledge, there exists no algorithm presenting the worst upper bound for (1, 2)-QSAT. Therefore in this paper, we present an exact algorithm to solve (1, 2)-QSAT. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain a worst-case upper bound O(1.4142m), where m is the number of clauses.",0
"We introduce a new type of fully computable problems, for DSS dedicated to maximal spanning tree problems, based on deduction and choice: preferential consistency problems. To show its interest, we describe a new compact representation of preferences specific to spanning trees, identifying an efficient maximal spanning tree sub-problem. Next, we compare this problem with the Pareto-based multiobjective one. And at last, we propose an efficient algorithm solving the associated preferential consistency problem.",0
"In this work, a study on Variable Neighborhood Search algorithms for multi-depot dial-a-ride problems is presented. In dial-a-ride problems patients need to be transported from pre-specified pickup locations to pre-specified delivery locations, under different considerations. The addressed problem presents several constraints and features, such as heterogeneous vehicles, distributed in different depots, and heterogeneous patients. The aim is of minimizing the total routing cost, while respecting time-window, ride-time, capacity and route duration constraints. The objective of the study is of determining the best algorithm configuration in terms of initial solution, neighborhood and local search procedures. At this aim, two different procedures for the computation of an initial solution, six different type of neighborhoods and five local search procedures, where only intra-route changes are made, have been considered and compared.",0
"Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be among the most effective in solving large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on. We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of $\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.",0
"Natural Immune system plays a vital role in the survival of the all living being. It provides a mechanism to defend itself from external predates making it consistent systems, capable of adapting itself for survival incase of changes. The human immune system has motivated scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms that has solved complex engineering tasks. This paper explores one of the various possibilities for solving problem in a Multiagent scenario wherein multiple robots are deployed to achieve a goal collectively. The final goal is dependent on the performance of individual robot and its survival without having to lose its energy beyond a predetermined threshold value by deploying an evolutionary computational technique otherwise called the artificial immune system that imitates the biological immune system.",0
"In this paper, we advocate the use of stratified logical theories for representing probabilistic models. We argue that such encodings can be more interpretable than those obtained in existing frameworks such as Markov logic networks. Among others, this allows for the use of domain experts to improve learned models by directly removing, adding, or modifying logical formulas.",0
"An open concept of rough evolution and an axiomatic approach to granules was also developed recently by the present author. Subsequently the concepts were used in the formal framework of rough Y-systems (RYS) for developing on granular correspondences by her. These have since been used for a new approach towards comparison of rough algebraic semantics across different semantic domains by way of correspondences that preserve rough evolution and try to avoid contamination. In this research paper, new methods are proposed and a semantics for handling possibly contaminated operations and structured bigness is developed. These would also be of natural interest for relative consistency of one collection of knowledge relative other.",0
"Throughout the history of games, representing the abilities of the various agents acting on behalf of the players has been a central concern. With increasingly sophisticated games emerging, these simulations have become more realistic, but the underlying mechanisms are still, to a large extent, of an ad hoc nature. This paper proposes using a logistic model from psychometrics as a unified mechanism for task resolution in simulation-oriented games.",0
"Social intelligence in natural and artificial systems is usually measured by the evaluation of associated traits or tasks that are deemed to represent some facets of social behaviour. The amalgamation of these traits is then used to configure the intuitive notion of social intelligence. Instead, in this paper we start from a parametrised definition of social intelligence as the expected performance in a set of environments with several agents, and we assess and derive tests from it. This definition makes several dependencies explicit: (1) the definition depends on the choice (and weight) of environments and agents, (2) the definition may include both competitive and cooperative behaviours depending on how agents and rewards are arranged into teams, (3) the definition mostly depends on the abilities of other agents, and (4) the actual difference between social intelligence and general intelligence (or other abilities) depends on these choices. As a result, we address the problem of converting this definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties ensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and anticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some other more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry, validity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the definition into a practical test. From the definition and the formalised properties, we take a look at several representative multi-agent environments, tests and games to see whether they meet these properties.",0
"VCM (Visualization of Concept in Medicine) is an iconic language for representing key medical concepts by icons. However, the use of this language with reference terminologies, such as SNOMED CT, will require the mapping of its icons to the terms of these terminologies. Here, we present and evaluate a semi-automatic semantic method for the mapping of SNOMED CT concepts to VCM icons. Both SNOMED CT and VCM are compositional in nature; SNOMED CT is expressed in description logic and VCM semantics are formalized in an OWL ontology. The proposed method involves the manual mapping of a limited number of underlying concepts from the VCM ontology, followed by automatic generation of the rest of the mapping. We applied this method to the clinical findings of the SNOMED CT CORE subset, and 100 randomly-selected mappings were evaluated by three experts. The results obtained were promising, with 82 of the SNOMED CT concepts correctly linked to VCM icons according to the experts. Most of the errors were easy to fix.",0
"We propose a model for errors in sung queries, a variant of the hidden Markov model (HMM). This is a solution to the problem of identifying the degree of similarity between a (typically error-laden) sung query and a potential target in a database of musical works, an important problem in the field of music information retrieval. Similarity metrics are a critical component of query-by-humming (QBH) applications which search audio and multimedia databases for strong matches to oral queries. Our model comprehensively expresses the types of error or variation between target and query: cumulative and non-cumulative local errors, transposition, tempo and tempo changes, insertions, deletions and modulation. The model is not only expressive, but automatically trainable, or able to learn and generalize from query examples. We present results of simulations, designed to assess the discriminatory potential of the model, and tests with real sung queries, to demonstrate relevance to real-world applications.",0
"When agents devise plans for execution in the real world, they face two important forms of uncertainty: they can never have complete knowledge about the state of the world, and they do not have complete control, as the effects of their actions are uncertain. While most classical planning methods avoid explicit uncertainty reasoning, we believe that uncertainty should be explicitly represented and reasoned about. We develop a probabilistic representation for states and actions, based on belief networks. We define conditional belief nets (CBNs) to capture the probabilistic dependency of the effects of an action upon the state of the world. We also use a CBN to represent the intrinsic relationships among entities in the environment, which persist from state to state. We present a simple projection algorithm to construct the belief network of the state succeeding an action, using the environment CBN model to infer indirect effects. We discuss how the qualitative aspects of belief networks and CBNs make them appropriate for the various stages of the problem solving process, from model construction to the design of planning algorithms.",0
"In this brief abstract, we develop a computationally simpler version of the operator count heuristic for a particular class of domains. The contribution of this abstract is thus threefold, we (1) propose an efficient closed form approximation to the operator count heuristic; (2) leverage compressed sensing techniques to obtain an integer approximation in polynomial time; and (3) discuss the relationship of the proposed formulation to existing heuristics and investigate properties of domains where such approaches are useful.",0
"In multi-label classification, the main focus has been to develop ways of learning the underlying dependencies between labels, and to take advantage of this at classification time. Developing better feature-space representations has been predominantly employed to reduce complexity, e.g., by eliminating non-helpful feature attributes from the input space prior to (or during) training. This is an important task, since many multi-label methods typically create many different copies or views of the same input data as they transform it, and considerable memory can be saved by taking advantage of redundancy. In this paper, we show that a proper development of the feature space can make labels less interdependent and easier to model and predict at inference time. For this task we use a deep learning approach with restricted Boltzmann machines. We present a deep network that, in an empirical evaluation, outperforms a number of competitive methods from the literature",0
"The expected value of information (EVI) is the most powerful measure of sensitivity to uncertainty in a decision model: it measures the potential of information to improve the decision, and hence measures the expected value of outcome. Standard methods for computing EVI use discrete variables and are computationally intractable for models that contain more than a few variables. Monte Carlo simulation provides the basis for more tractable evaluation of large predictive models with continuous and discrete variables, but so far computation of EVI in a Monte Carlo setting also has appeared impractical. We introduce an approximate approach based on pre-posterior analysis for estimating EVI in Monte Carlo models. Our method uses a linear approximation to the value function and multiple linear regression to estimate the linear model from the samples. The approach is efficient and practical for extremely large models. It allows easy estimation of EVI for perfect or partial information on individual variables or on combinations of variables. We illustrate its implementation within Demos (a decision modeling system), and its application to a large model for crisis transportation planning.",0
"Demand response provides utilities with a mechanism to share with end users the stochasticity resulting from the use of renewable sources. Pricing is accordingly used to reflect energy availability, to allocate such a limited resource to those loads that value it most. However, the strictly competitive mechanism can result in service interruption in presence of competing demand. To solve this issue we investigate on the use of forward contracts, i.e., service level agreements priced to reflect the expectation of future supply and demand curves. Given the limited resources of microgrids, service interruption is an opposite objective to the one of service availability. We firstly design policy-based brokers and identify then a learning broker based on artificial neural networks. We show the latter being progressively minimizing the reimbursement costs and maximizing the overall profit.",0
"We present a precise definition of cause and effect in terms of a fundamental notion called unresponsiveness. Our definition is based on Savage's (1954) formulation of decision theory and departs from the traditional view of causation in that our causal assertions are made relative to a set of decisions. An important consequence of this departure is that we can reason about cause locally, not requiring a causal explanation for every dependency. Such local reasoning can be beneficial because it may not be necessary to determine whether a particular dependency is causal to make a decision. Also in this paper, we examine the graphical encoding of causal relationships. We show that influence diagrams in canonical form are an accurate and efficient representation of causal relationships. In addition, we establish a correspondence between canonical form and Pearl's causal theory.",0
"Natural language correction has the potential to help language learners improve their writing skills. While approaches with separate classifiers for different error types have high precision, they do not flexibly handle errors such as redundancy or non-idiomatic phrasing. On the other hand, word and phrase-based machine translation methods are not designed to cope with orthographic errors, and have recently been outpaced by neural models. Motivated by these issues, we present a neural network-based approach to language correction. The core component of our method is an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism. By operating at the character level, the network avoids the problem of out-of-vocabulary words. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach on dataset of noisy, user-generated text collected from an English learner forum. When combined with a language model, our method achieves a state-of-the-art $F_{0.5}$-score on the CoNLL 2014 Shared Task. We further demonstrate that training the network on additional data with synthesized errors can improve performance.",0
"In this work, we propose a novel decoding approach for neural machine translation (NMT) based on continuous optimisation. The resulting optimisation problem can then be tackled using a whole range of continuous optimisation algorithms which have been developed and used in the literature mainly for training. Our approach is general and can be applied to other sequence-to-sequence neural models as well. We make use of this powerful decoding approach to intersect an underlying NMT with a language model, to intersect left-to-right and right-to-left NMT models, and to decode with soft constraints involving coverage and fertility of the source sentence words. The experimental results show the promise of the proposed framework.",1
"In this paper one presents new similarity, cardinality and entropy measures for bipolar fuzzy set and for its particular forms like intuitionistic, paraconsistent and fuzzy set. All these are constructed in the framework of multi-valued representations and are based on a penta-valued logic that uses the following logical values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and ambiguous. Also a new distance for bounded real interval was defined.",0
"Consider learning a policy from example expert behavior, without interaction with the expert or access to reinforcement signal. One approach is to recover the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.",1
"Suppose we want to build a system that answers a natural language question by representing its semantics as a logical form and computing the answer given a structured database of facts. The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.",1
"The combined approach of the Qualitative Reasoning and Probabilistic Functions for the knowledge representation is proposed. The method aims at represent uncertain, qualitative knowledge that is essential for the moving blocks task's execution. The attempt to formalize the commonsense knowledge is performed with the Situation Calculus language for reasoning and robot's beliefs representation. The method is implemented in the Prolog programming language and tested for a specific simulated scenario. In most cases the implementation enables us to solve a given task, i.e., move blocks to desired positions. The example of robot's reasoning and main parts of the implemented program's code are presented.",0
"This paper proposes a model which aim is providing a more coherent framework for agents design. We identify three closely related anthropo-centered domains working on separate functional levels. Abstracting from human physiology, psychology, and philosophy we create the $P^3$ model to be used as a multi-tier approach to deal with complex class of problems. The three layers identified in this model have been named PhysioComputing, MindComputing, and MetaComputing. Several instantiations of this model are finally presented related to different IT areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, software and service engineering.",0
"Epistemic planning can be used for decision making in multi-agent situations with distributed knowledge and capabilities. Recently, Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for epistemic planning. We extend the DEL-based epistemic planning framework to include perspective shifts, allowing us to define new notions of sequential and conditional planning with implicit coordination. With these, it is possible to solve planning tasks with joint goals in a decentralized manner without the agents having to negotiate about and commit to a joint policy at plan time. First we define the central planning notions and sketch the implementation of a planning system built on those notions. Afterwards we provide some case studies in order to evaluate the planner empirically and to show that the concept is useful for multi-agent systems in practice.",0
"With the constant growth of the World Wide Web and the number of documents in different languages accordingly, the need for reliable language detection tools has increased as well. Platforms such as Twitter with predominantly short texts are becoming important information resources, which additionally imposes the need for short texts language detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how incorporating personalized user-specific information into the language detection algorithm leads to an important improvement of detection results. To choose the best algorithm for language detection for short text messages, we investigate several machine learning approaches. These approaches include the use of the well-known classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression, a dictionary based approach, and a probabilistic model based on modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, the extension of the probabilistic model to include additional user-specific information such as evidence accumulation per user and user interface language is explored, with the goal of improving the classification performance. The proposed approaches are evaluated on randomly collected Twitter data containing Latin as well as non-Latin alphabet languages and the quality of the obtained results is compared, followed by the selection of the best performing algorithm. This algorithm is then evaluated against two already existing general language detection tools: Chromium Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2) and langid, where our method significantly outperforms the results achieved by both of the mentioned methods. Additionally, a preview of benefits and possible applications of having a reliable language detection algorithm is given.",0
Neo-fuzzy elements are used as nodes for an evolving cascade system. The proposed system can tune both its parameters and architecture in an online mode. It can be used for solving a wide range of Data Mining tasks (namely time series forecasting). The evolving cascade system with neo-fuzzy nodes can process rather large data sets with high speed and effectiveness.,0
"Integration is affected by the curse of dimensionality and quickly becomes intractable as the dimensionality of the problem grows. We propose a randomized algorithm that, with high probability, gives a constant-factor approximation of a general discrete integral defined over an exponentially large set. This algorithm relies on solving only a small number of instances of a discrete combinatorial optimization problem subject to randomly generated parity constraints used as a hash function. As an application, we demonstrate that with a small number of MAP queries we can efficiently approximate the partition function of discrete graphical models, which can in turn be used, for instance, for marginal computation or model selection.",1
"Many representation schemes combining first-order logic and probability have been proposed in recent years. Progress in unifying logical and probabilistic inference has been slower. Existing methods are mainly variants of lifted variable elimination and belief propagation, neither of which take logical structure into account. We propose the first method that has the full power of both graphical model inference and first-order theorem proving (in finite domains with Herbrand interpretations). We first define probabilistic theorem proving, their generalization, as the problem of computing the probability of a logical formula given the probabilities or weights of a set of formulas. We then show how this can be reduced to the problem of lifted weighted model counting, and develop an efficient algorithm for the latter. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, investigate its properties, and show how it generalizes previous approaches. Experiments show that it greatly outperforms lifted variable elimination when logical structure is present. Finally, we propose an algorithm for approximate probabilistic theorem proving, and show that it can greatly outperform lifted belief propagation.",0
"Assessing network security is a complex and difficult task. Attack graphs have been proposed as a tool to help network administrators understand the potential weaknesses of their network. However, a problem has not yet been addressed by previous work on this subject; namely, how to actually execute and validate the attack paths resulting from the analysis of the attack graph. In this paper we present a complete PDDL representation of an attack model, and an implementation that integrates a planner into a penetration testing tool. This allows to automatically generate attack paths for penetration testing scenarios, and to validate these attacks by executing the corresponding actions -including exploits- against the real target network. We present an algorithm for transforming the information present in the penetration testing tool to the planning domain, and show how the scalability issues of attack graphs can be solved using current planners. We include an analysis of the performance of our solution, showing how our model scales to medium-sized networks and the number of actions available in current penetration testing tools.",0
"Sequence-to-sequence neural translation models learn semantic and syntactic relations between sentence pairs by optimizing the likelihood of the target given the source, i.e., $p(y|x)$, an objective that ignores other potentially useful sources of information. We introduce an alternative objective function for neural MT that maximizes the mutual information between the source and target sentences, modeling the bi-directional dependency of sources and targets. We implement the model with a simple re-ranking method, and also introduce a decoding algorithm that increases diversity in the N-best list produced by the first pass. Applied to the WMT German/English and French/English tasks, both mechanisms offer a consistent performance boost on both standard LSTM and attention-based neural MT architectures. The result is the best published performance for a single (non-ensemble) neural MT system, as well as the potential application of our diverse decoding algorithm to other NLP re-ranking tasks.",0
"The introduction of automated vehicles without permanent human supervision demands a functional system description including functional system boundaries and a comprehensive safety analysis. These inputs to the technical development can be identified and analyzed by a scenario-based approach. Experts are doing well to identify scenarios that are difficult to handle or unlikely to happen. To establish an economical test and release process, a large number of scenarios must be identified to enable an execution of test-cases in simulation environments. Expert knowledge modeled for computer aided processing may help for the purpose of providing a wide range of scenarios. This contribution reviews the use of ontologies as knowledge-based systems in the field of automated vehicles, and proposes a modeling concept for traffic scenes. Afterwards, a process to create scenes from the gathered knowledge is introduced and the utilization of ontologies in the given problem statement is evaluated using criteria from literature.",0
"In this paper, we applied a dynamic model for manoeuvring targets in SIR particle filter algorithm for improving tracking accuracy of multiple manoeuvring targets. In our proposed approach, a color distribution model is used to detect changes of target's model . Our proposed approach controls deformation of target's model. If deformation of target's model is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm. We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF) . DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos. Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm is not able to track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model. However, DDPF approach updates target's model when the rotation or scaling is occurred. Thus, the proposed approach is able to track the manoeuvring targets more efficiently and accurately.",0
"This paper develops upper and lower bounds for the probability of Boolean functions by treating multiple occurrences of variables as independent and assigning them new individual probabilities. We call this approach dissociation and give an exact characterization of optimal oblivious bounds, i.e. when the new probabilities are chosen independent of the probabilities of all other variables. Our motivation comes from the weighted model counting problem (or, equivalently, the problem of computing the probability of a Boolean function), which is #P-hard in general. By performing several dissociations, one can transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based approximations and unify them as concrete choices in a larger design space. We also show how our theory allows a standard relational database management system (DBMS) to both upper and lower bound hard probabilistic queries in guaranteed polynomial time.",0
"In many domains it is desirable to assess the preferences of users in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. Such representations of qualitative preference orderings form an importnat component of automated decision tools. We propose a graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is ofetn compact and arguably natural. We describe several search algorithms for dominance testing based on this representation; these algorithms are quite effective, especially in specific network topologies, such as chain-and tree- structured networks, as well as polytrees.",0
"In this paper, we propose a dynamic shared context processing method based on DSC (Dynamic Shared Context) model, applied in an e-collaborative learning environment. Firstly, we present the model. This is a way to measure the relevance between events and roles in collaborative environments. With this method, we can share the most appropriate event information for each role instead of sharing all information to all roles in a collaborative work environment. Then, we apply and verify this method in our project with Google App supported e-learning collaborative environment. During this experiment, we compared DSC method measured relevance of events and roles to manual measured relevance. And we describe the favorable points from this comparison and our finding. Finally, we discuss our future research of a hybrid DSC method to make dynamical information shared more effective in a collaborative work environment.",0

"This paper is about reducing influence diagram (ID) evaluation into Bayesian network (BN) inference problems. Such reduction is interesting because it enables one to readily use one's favorite BN inference algorithm to efficiently evaluate IDs. Two such reduction methods have been proposed previously (Cooper 1988, Shachter and Peot 1992). This paper proposes a new method. The BN inference problems induced by the mew method are much easier to solve than those induced by the two previous methods.",0
"Several authors have explained that the likelihood ratio measures the strength of the evidence represented by observations in statistical problems. This idea works fine when the goal is to evaluate the strength of the available evidence for a simple hypothesis versus another simple hypothesis. However, the applicability of this idea is limited to simple hypotheses because the likelihood function is primarily defined on points (simple hypotheses) of the parameter space. In this paper we define a general weight of evidence that is applicable to both simple and composite hypotheses. It is based on the Dempster-Shafer concept of plausibility and is shown to be a generalization of the likelihood ratio. Functional models are of a fundamental importance for the general weight of evidence proposed in this paper. The relevant concepts and ideas are explained by means of a familiar urn problem and the general analysis of a real-world medical problem is presented.",0
"A series of monte carlo studies were performed to compare the behavior of some alternative procedures for reasoning under uncertainty. The behavior of several Bayesian, linear model and default reasoning procedures were examined in the context of increasing levels of calibration error. The most interesting result is that Bayesian procedures tended to output more extreme posterior belief values (posterior beliefs near 0.0 or 1.0) than other techniques, but the linear models were relatively less likely to output strong support for an erroneous conclusion. Also, accounting for the probabilistic dependencies between evidence items was important for both Bayesian and linear updating procedures.",0
"This paper gives an overview of impersonation bots that generate output in one, or possibly, multiple modalities. We also discuss rapidly advancing areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence that could lead to frighteningly powerful new multi-modal social bots. Our main conclusion is that most commonly known bots are one dimensional (i.e., chatterbot), and far from deceiving serious interrogators. However, using recent advances in machine learning, it is possible to unleash incredibly powerful, human-like armies of social bots, in potentially well coordinated campaigns of deception and influence.",0
"A significant amount of the world's knowledge is stored in relational databases. However, the ability for users to retrieve facts from a database is limited due to a lack of understanding of query languages such as SQL. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding SQL queries. Our model leverages the structure of SQL queries to significantly reduce the output space of generated queries. Moreover, we use rewards from in-the-loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate unordered parts of the query, which we show are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. In addition, we will publish WikiSQL, a dataset of 87726 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries distributed across 26375 tables from Wikipedia. This dataset is required to train our model and is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy-based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to WikiSQL, our model Seq2SQL outperforms attentional sequence to sequence models, improving execution accuracy from 35.9% to 60.3% and logical form accuracy from 23.4% to 49.2%.",0
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide useful tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing the topology of environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both the models and the algorithm that learns them. By taking advantage of such information, learning HMMs/POMDPs can be made to generate better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results, obtained from both simulated and real robot data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",0
"An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of ""normal"" examples with only a small percentage of ""abnormal"" or ""interesting"" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.",0
"Multicriteria decision analysis aims at supporting a person facing a decision problem involving conflicting criteria. We consider an additive utility model which provides robust conclusions based on preferences elicited from the decision maker. The recommendations based on these robust conclusions are even more convincing if they are complemented by explanations. We propose a general scheme, based on sequence of preference swaps, in which explanations can be computed. We show first that the length of explanations can be unbounded in the general case. However, in the case of binary reference scales, this length is bounded and we provide an algorithm to compute the corresponding explanation.",0
"Stochastic Constraint Programming (SCP) is an extension of Constraint Programming (CP) used for modelling and solving problems involving constraints and uncertainty. SCP inherits excellent modelling abilities and filtering algorithms from CP, but so far it has not been applied to large problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) extends Dynamic Programming to large stochastic problems, but is problem-specific and has no generic solvers. We propose a hybrid combining the scalability of RL with the modelling and constraint filtering methods of CP. We implement a prototype in a CP system and demonstrate its usefulness on SCP problems.",0
An evolving weighted neuro-neo-fuzzy-ANARX model and its learning procedures are introduced in the article. This system is basically used for time series forecasting. This system may be considered as a pool of elements that process data in a parallel manner. The proposed evolving system may provide online processing data streams.,0
"It has been suggested that, when faced with large amounts of uncertainty in situations of automated control, type-2 fuzzy logic based controllers will out-perform the simpler type-1 varieties due to the latter lacking the flexibility to adapt accordingly. This paper aims to investigate this problem in detail in order to analyse when a type-2 controller will improve upon type-1 performance. A robotic sailing boat is subjected to several experiments in which the uncertainty and difficulty of the sailing problem is increased in order to observe the effects on measured performance. Improved performance is observed but not in every case. The size of the FOU is shown to be have a large effect on performance with potentially severe performance penalties for incorrectly sized footprints.",0
"Programs to solve so-called constraint problems are complex pieces of software which require many design decisions to be made more or less arbitrarily by the implementer. These decisions affect the performance of the finished solver significantly. Once a design decision has been made, it cannot easily be reversed, although a different decision may be more appropriate for a particular problem.",0
"The Knowledge of Preconditions principle (KoP) is proposed as a widely applicable connection between knowledge and action in multi-agent systems. Roughly speaking, it asserts that if some condition is a necessary condition for performing a given action A, then knowing that this condition holds is also a necessary condition for performing A. Since the specifications of tasks often involve necessary conditions for actions, the KoP principle shows that such specifications induce knowledge preconditions for the actions. Distributed protocols or multi-agent plans that satisfy the specifications must ensure that this knowledge be attained, and that it is detected by the agents as a condition for action. The knowledge of preconditions principle is formalised in the runs and systems framework, and is proven to hold in a wide class of settings. Well-known connections between knowledge and coordinated action are extended and shown to derive directly from the KoP principle: a ""common knowledge of preconditions"" principle is established showing that common knowledge is a necessary condition for performing simultaneous actions, and a ""nested knowledge of preconditions"" principle is proven, showing that coordinating actions to be performed in linear temporal order requires a corresponding form of nested knowledge.",0
"Knowledge graphs are large, useful, but incomplete knowledge repositories. They encode knowledge through entities and relations which define each other through the connective structure of the graph. This has inspired methods for the joint embedding of entities and relations in continuous low-dimensional vector spaces, that can be used to induce new edges in the graph, i.e., link prediction in knowledge graphs. Learning these representations relies on contrasting positive instances with negative ones. Knowledge graphs include only positive relation instances, leaving the door open for a variety of methods for selecting negative examples. In this paper we present an empirical study on the impact of negative sampling on the learned embeddings, assessed through the task of link prediction. We use state-of-the-art knowledge graph embeddings -- \rescal , TransE, DistMult and ComplEX -- and evaluate on benchmark datasets -- FB15k and WN18. We compare well known methods for negative sampling and additionally propose embedding based sampling methods. We note a marked difference in the impact of these sampling methods on the two datasets, with the ""traditional"" corrupting positives method leading to best results on WN18, while embedding based methods benefiting the task on FB15k.",0
"Classic machine learning algorithms learn from labelled examples. For example, to design a machine translation system, a typical training set will consist of English sentences and their translation. There is a stronger model, in which the algorithm can also query for labels of new examples it creates. E.g, in the translation task, the algorithm can create a new English sentence, and request its translation from the user during training. This combination of examples and queries has been widely studied. Yet, despite many theoretical results, query algorithms are almost never used. One of the main causes for this is a report (Baum and Lang, 1992) on very disappointing empirical performance of a query algorithm. These poor results were mainly attributed to the fact that the algorithm queried for labels of examples that are artificial, and impossible to interpret by humans.",0
"Consider a setting where selfish agents are to be assigned to coalitions or projects from a fixed set P. Each project k is characterized by a valuation function; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project k. We study the following classic problem in this setting: ""how should the agents divide the value that they collectively create?"". One traditional approach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the implicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents can partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we consider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes computing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.",0
"In classical reinforcement learning, when exploring an environment, agents accept arbitrary short term loss for long term gain. This is infeasible for safety critical applications, such as robotics, where even a single unsafe action may cause system failure. In this paper, we address the problem of safely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in terms of an, a priori unknown, safety constraint that depends on states and actions. We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the unknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is able to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without violating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe states and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of unvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating the environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when exploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no safe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task of exploring an unknown map with a rover.",1
"Most human behaviors consist of multiple parts, steps, or subtasks. These structures guide our action planning and execution, but when we observe others, the latent structure of their actions is typically unobservable, and must be inferred in order to learn new skills by demonstration, or to assist others in completing their tasks. For example, an assistant who has learned the subgoal structure of a colleague's task can more rapidly recognize and support their actions as they unfold. Here we model how humans infer subgoals from observations of complex action sequences using a nonparametric Bayesian model, which assumes that observed actions are generated by approximately rational planning over unknown subgoal sequences. We test this model with a behavioral experiment in which humans observed different series of goal-directed actions, and inferred both the number and composition of the subgoal sequences associated with each goal. The Bayesian model predicts human subgoal inferences with high accuracy, and significantly better than several alternative models and straightforward heuristics. Motivated by this result, we simulate how learning and inference of subgoals can improve performance in an artificial user assistance task. The Bayesian model learns the correct subgoals from fewer observations, and better assists users by more rapidly and accurately inferring the goal of their actions than alternative approaches.",1
"Enforcing local consistencies in cost function networks is performed by applying so-called Equivalent Preserving Transformations (EPTs) to the cost functions. As EPTs transform the cost functions, they may break the property that was making local consistency enforcement tractable on a global cost function. A global cost function is called tractable projection-safe when applying an EPT to it is tractable and does not break the tractability property. In this paper, we prove that depending on the size r of the smallest scopes used for performing EPTs, the tractability of global cost functions can be preserved (r = 0) or destroyed (r &gt; 1). When r = 1, the answer is indefinite. We show that on a large family of cost functions, EPTs can be computed via dynamic programming-based algorithms, leading to tractable projection-safety. We also show that when a global cost function can be decomposed into a Berge acyclic network of bounded arity cost functions, soft local consistencies such as soft Directed or Virtual Arc Consistency can directly emulate dynamic programming. These different approaches to decomposable cost functions are then embedded in a solver for extensive experiments that confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our proposal.",0
"In the context of Smart Cities, indicator definitions have been used to calculate values that enable the comparison among different cities. The calculation of an indicator values has challenges as the calculation may need to combine some aspects of quality while addressing different levels of abstraction. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been used successfully to support flexible representation, which can support improved understanding and data analysis in similar settings. This paper presents an operational description for a city KG, an indicator ontology that support indicator discovery and data visualization and an application capable of performing metadata analysis to automatically build and display dashboards according to discovered indicators. We describe our implementation in an urban mobility setting.",0
IDP is a knowledge base system based on first order logic. It is finding its way to a larger public but is still facing practical challenges. Adoption of new languages requires a newcomer-friendly way for users to interact with it. Both an online presence to try to convince potential users to download the system and offline availability to develop larger applications are essential. We developed an IDE which can serve both purposes through the use of web technology. It enables us to provide the user with a modern IDE with relatively little effort.,0
"This article addresses an open problem in the area of cognitive systems and architectures: namely the problem of handling (in terms of processing and reasoning capabilities) complex knowledge structures that can be at least plausibly comparable, both in terms of size and of typology of the encoded information, to the knowledge that humans process daily for executing everyday activities. Handling a huge amount of knowledge, and selectively retrieve it ac- cording to the needs emerging in different situational scenarios, is an important aspect of human intelligence. For this task, in fact, humans adopt a wide range of heuristics (Gigerenzer and Todd) due to their bounded rationality (Simon, 1957). In this perspective, one of the re- quirements that should be considered for the design, the realization and the evaluation of intelligent cognitively inspired systems should be represented by their ability of heuristically identify and retrieve, from the general knowledge stored in their artificial Long Term Memory (LTM), that one which is synthetically and contextually relevant. This require- ment, however, is often neglected. Currently, artificial cognitive systems and architectures are not able, de facto, to deal with complex knowledge structures that can be even slightly comparable to the knowledge heuris- tically managed by humans. In this paper I will argue that this is not only a technological problem but also an epistemological one and I will briefly sketch a proposal for a possible solution.",0
"Covering model provides a general framework for granular computing in that overlapping among granules are almost indispensable. For any given covering, both intersection and union of covering blocks containing an element are exploited as granules to form granular worlds at different abstraction levels, respectively, and transformations among these different granular worlds are also discussed. As an application of the presented multi-granular perspective on covering, relational interpretation and axiomization of four types of covering based rough upper approximation operators are investigated, which can be dually applied to lower ones.",0
"LogitBoost and its later improvement, ABC-LogitBoost, are both successful multi-class boosting algorithms for classification. In this paper, we explicitly formulate the tree building at each LogitBoost iteration as constrained quadratic optimization. Both LogitBoost and ABC-LogtiBoost adopt approximated solver to such quadratic subproblem. We then propose an intuitively more natural solver, i.e. the block coordinate descent algorithm, and demonstrate that it leads to higher classification accuracy and faster convergence rate on a number of public datasets. This new LogitBoost behaves as if it combines many one-vs-one binary classifiers adaptively, hence the name AOSO-LogitBoost(Adaptive One-vs-One LogitBoost)",1
Backdoors of answer-set programs are sets of atoms that represent clever reasoning shortcuts through the search space. Assignments to backdoor atoms reduce the given program to several programs that belong to a tractable target class. Previous research has considered target classes based on notions of acyclicity where various types of cycles (good and bad cycles) are excluded from graph representations of programs. We generalize the target classes by taking the parity of the number of negative edges on bad cycles into account and consider backdoors for such classes. We establish new hardness results and non-uniform polynomial-time tractability relative to directed or undirected cycles.,0
"This paper discusses a system that accelerates reinforcement learning by using transfer from related tasks. Without such transfer, even if two tasks are very similar at some abstract level, an extensive re-learning effort is required. The system achieves much of its power by transferring parts of previously learned solutions rather than a single complete solution. The system exploits strong features in the multi-dimensional function produced by reinforcement learning in solving a particular task. These features are stable and easy to recognize early in the learning process. They generate a partitioning of the state space and thus the function. The partition is represented as a graph. This is used to index and compose functions stored in a case base to form a close approximation to the solution of the new task. Experiments demonstrate that function composition often produces more than an order of magnitude increase in learning rate compared to a basic reinforcement learning algorithm.",0
"Learned models composed of probabilistic logical rules are useful for many tasks, such as knowledge base completion. Unfortunately this learning problem is difficult, since determining the structure of the theory normally requires solving a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: a completely differentiable model for learning sets of first-order rules. The approach is inspired by a recently-developed differentiable logic, i.e. a subset of first-order logic for which inference tasks can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. Here we describe a neural controller system which learns how to sequentially compose the these primitive differentiable operations to solve reasoning tasks, and in particular, to perform knowledge base completion. The long-term goal of this work is to develop integrated, end-to-end systems that can learn to perform high-level logical reasoning as well as lower-level perceptual tasks.",1
"Data Warehouses are structures with large amount of data collected from heterogeneous sources to be used in a decision support system. Data Warehouses analysis identifies hidden patterns initially unexpected which analysis requires great memory and computation cost. Data reduction methods were proposed to make this analysis easier. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) as Evolutionary Algorithms and the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) as Analysis Factor Methods to conduct this reduction. Our approach identifies reduced subset of dimensions from the initial subset p where p'&lt;p where it is proposed to find the profile fact that is the closest to reference. GAs identify the possible subsets and the Khi formula of the ACM evaluates the quality of each subset. The study is based on a distance measurement between the reference and n facts profile extracted from the Warehouses.",0
"This paper details the implementation of an algorithm for automatically generating a high-level knowledge network to perform commonsense reasoning, specifically with the application of robotic task repair. The network is represented using a Bayesian Logic Network (BLN) (Jain, Waldherr, and Beetz 2009), which combines a set of directed relations between abstract concepts, including IsA, AtLocation, HasProperty, and UsedFor, with a corresponding probability distribution that models the uncertainty inherent in these relations. Inference over this network enables reasoning over the abstract concepts in order to perform appropriate object substitution or to locate missing objects in the robot's environment. The structure of the network is generated by combining information from two existing knowledge sources: ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi 2012), and WordNet (Miller 1995). This is done in a ""situated"" manner by only including information relevant a given context. Results show that the generated network is able to accurately predict object categories, locations, properties, and affordances in three different household scenarios.",0
"Relentless progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly raising concerns that machines will replace humans on the job market, and perhaps altogether. Eliezer Yudkowski and others have explored the possibility that a promising future for humankind could be guaranteed by a superintelligent ""Friendly AI"", designed to safeguard humanity and its values. I argue that, from a physics perspective where everything is simply an arrangement of elementary particles, this might be even harder than it appears. Indeed, it may require thinking rigorously about the meaning of life: What is ""meaning"" in a particle arrangement? What is ""life""? What is the ultimate ethical imperative, i.e., how should we strive to rearrange the particles of our Universe and shape its future? If we fail to answer the last question rigorously, this future is unlikely to contain humans.",0
"We propose an attention-enabled encoder-decoder model for the problem of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Most previous work has tackled the problem via joint sequence models that require explicit alignments for training. In contrast, the attention-enabled encoder-decoder model allows for jointly learning to align and convert characters to phonemes. We explore different types of attention models, including global and local attention, and our best models achieve state-of-the-art results on three standard data sets (CMUDict, Pronlex, and NetTalk).",0
"Online offerings such as web search, news portals, and e-commerce applications face the challenge of providing high-quality service to a large, heterogeneous user base. Recent efforts have highlighted the potential to improve performance by introducing methods to personalize services based on special knowledge about users and their context. For example, a users demographics, location, and past search and browsing may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries. However, reasonable concerns about privacy by both users, providers, and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens, may limit access by services to such information. We introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization, where people can opt to share personal information, in a standing or on-demand manner, in return for expected enhancements in the quality of an online service. We focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy. We demonstrate how we can find a provably near-optimal optimization of the utility-privacy tradeoff in an efficient manner. We evaluate our methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants. We separately assess users' preferences about privacy and utility via a large-scale survey, aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples' willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency. We show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using a relatively small amount of information about users.",0
"Plausibility models are Kripke models that agents use to reason about knowledge and belief, both of themselves and of each other. Such models are used to interpret the notions of conditional belief, degrees of belief, and safe belief. The logic of conditional belief contains that modality and also the knowledge modality, and similarly for the logic of degrees of belief and the logic of safe belief. With respect to these logics, plausibility models may contain too much information. A proper notion of bisimulation is required that characterises them. We define that notion of bisimulation and prove the required characterisations: on the class of image-finite and preimage-finite models (with respect to the plausibility relation), two pointed Kripke models are modally equivalent in either of the three logics, if and only if they are bisimilar. As a result, the information content of such a model can be similarly expressed in the logic of conditional belief, or the logic of degrees of belief, or that of safe belief. This, we found a surprising result. Still, that does not mean that the logics are equally expressive: the logics of conditional and degrees of belief are incomparable, the logics of degrees of belief and safe belief are incomparable, while the logic of safe belief is more expressive than the logic of conditional belief. In view of the result on bisimulation characterisation, this is an equally surprising result. We hope our insights may contribute to the growing community of formal epistemology and on the relation between qualitative and quantitative modelling.",0

"Generating optimal plans in highly dynamic environments is challenging. Plans are predicated on an assumed initial state, but this state can change unexpectedly during plan generation, potentially invalidating the planning effort. In this paper we make three contributions: (1) We propose a novel algorithm for generating optimal plans in settings where frequent, unexpected events interfere with planning. It is able to quickly distinguish relevant from irrelevant state changes, and to update the existing planning search tree if necessary. (2) We argue for a new criterion for evaluating plan adaptation techniques: the relative running time compared to the ""size"" of changes. This is significant since during recovery more changes may occur that need to be recovered from subsequently, and in order for this process of repeated recovery to terminate, recovery time has to converge. (3) We show empirically that our approach can converge and find optimal plans in environments that would ordinarily defy planning due to their high dynamics.",0
"Ondex is a data integration and visualization platform developed to support Systems Biology Research. At its core is a data model based on two main principles: first, all information can be represented as a graph and, second, all elements of the graph can be annotated with ontologies. This data model is conformant to the Semantic Web framework, in particular to RDF, and therefore Ondex is ideally positioned as a platform that can exploit the semantic web.",0
"The early classifications of the computational complexity of planning under various restrictions in STRIPS (Bylander) and SAS+ (Baeckstroem and Nebel) have influenced following research in planning in many ways. We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.",1
"Real-time bidding (RTB) has become one of the largest online advertising markets in the world. Today the bid price per ad impression is typically decided by the expected value of how it can lead to a desired action event (e.g., registering an account or placing a purchase order) to the advertiser. However, this industry standard approach to decide the bid price does not consider the actual effect of the ad shown to the user, which should be measured based on the performance lift among users who have been or have not been exposed to a certain treatment of ads. In this paper, we propose a new bidding strategy and prove that if the bid price is decided based on the performance lift rather than absolute performance value, advertisers can actually gain more action events. We describe the modeling methodology to predict the performance lift and demonstrate the actual performance gain through blind A/B test with real ad campaigns in an industry-leading Demand-Side Platform (DSP). We also discuss the relationship between attribution models and bidding strategies. We prove that, to move the DSPs to bid based on performance lift, they should be rewarded according to the relative performance lift they contribute.",1
"Displaying a document in Middle Eastern languages requires contextual analysis due to different presentational forms for each character of the alphabet. The words of the document will be formed by the joining of the correct positional glyphs representing corresponding presentational forms of the characters. A set of rules defines the joining of the glyphs. As usual, these rules vary from language to language and are subject to interpretation by the software developers.",0
"In mechanical design, there is often unavoidable uncertainty in estimates of design performance. Evaluation of design alternatives requires consideration of the impact of this uncertainty. Expert heuristics embody assumptions regarding the designer's attitude towards risk and uncertainty that might be reasonable in most cases but inaccurate in others. We present a technique to allow designers to incorporate their own unique attitude towards uncertainty as opposed to those assumed by the domain expert's rules. The general approach is to eliminate aspects of heuristic rules which directly or indirectly include assumptions regarding the user's attitude towards risk, and replace them with explicit, user-specified probabilistic multi attribute utility and probability distribution functions. We illustrate the method in a system for material selection for automobile bumpers.",0
"We present some arguments why existing methods for representing agents fall short in applications crucial to artificial life. Using a thought experiment involving a fictitious dynamical systems model of the biosphere we argue that the metabolism, motility, and the concept of counterfactual variation should be compatible with any agent representation in dynamical systems. We then propose an information-theoretic notion of \emph{integrated spatiotemporal patterns} which we believe can serve as the basic building block of an agent definition. We argue that these patterns are capable of solving the problems mentioned before. We also test this in some preliminary experiments.",0
"Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.84, which is only 0.1 percent worse and 1.2x faster than the current state-of-the-art model. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art.",1
"We propose a goal-driven web navigation as a benchmark task for evaluating an agent with abilities to understand natural language and plan on partially observed environments. In this challenging task, an agent navigates through a web site, which is represented as a graph consisting of web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as directed edges, to find a web page in which a query appears. The agent is required to have sophisticated high-level reasoning based on natural languages and efficient sequential decision making capability to succeed. We release a software tool, called WebNav, that automatically transforms a website into this goal-driven web navigation task, and as an example, we make WikiNav, a dataset constructed from the English Wikipedia containing approximately 5 million articles and more than 12 million queries for training. We evaluate two different agents based on neural networks on the WikiNav and provide the human performance. Our results show the difficulty of the task for both humans and machines. With this benchmark, we expect faster progress in developing artificial agents with natural language understanding and planning skills.",1
"There is an increasing need for automated support for humans monitoring the activity of distributed teams of cooperating agents, both human and machine. We characterize the domain-independent challenges posed by this problem, and describe how properties of domains influence the challenges and their solutions. We will concentrate on dynamic, data-rich domains where humans are ultimately responsible for team behavior. Thus, the automated aid should interactively support effective and timely decision making by the human. We present a domain-independent categorization of the types of alerts a plan-based monitoring system might issue to a user, where each type generally requires different monitoring techniques. We describe a monitoring framework for integrating many domain-specific and task-specific monitoring techniques and then using the concept of value of an alert to avoid operator overload. We use this framework to describe an execution monitoring approach we have used to implement Execution Assistants (EAs) in two different dynamic, data-rich, real-world domains to assist a human in monitoring team behavior. One domain (Army small unit operations) has hundreds of mobile, geographically distributed agents, a combination of humans, robots, and vehicles. The other domain (teams of unmanned ground and air vehicles) has a handful of cooperating robots. Both domains involve unpredictable adversaries in the vicinity. Our approach customizes monitoring behavior for each specific task, plan, and situation, as well as for user preferences. Our EAs alert the human controller when reported events threaten plan execution or physically threaten team members. Alerts were generated in a timely manner without inundating the user with too many alerts (less than 10 percent of alerts are unwanted, as judged by domain experts).",0
"Systematic use of the published results of randomized clinical trials is increasingly important in evidence-based medicine. In order to collate and analyze the results from potentially numerous trials, evidence tables are used to represent trials concerning a set of interventions of interest. An evidence table has columns for the patient group, for each of the interventions being compared, for the criterion for the comparison (e.g. proportion who survived after 5 years from treatment), and for each of the results. Currently, it is a labour-intensive activity to read each published paper and extract the information for each field in an evidence table. There have been some NLP studies investigating how some of the features from papers can be extracted, or at least the relevant sentences identified. However, there is a lack of an NLP system for the systematic extraction of each item of information required for an evidence table. We address this need by a combination of a maximum entropy classifier, and integer linear programming. We use the later to handle constraints on what is an acceptable classification of the features to be extracted. With experimental results, we demonstrate substantial advantages in using global constraints (such as the features describing the patient group, and the interventions, must occur before the features describing the results of the comparison).",0
"We develop a framework for rendering photographic images, taking into account display limitations, so as to optimize perceptual similarity between the rendered image and the original scene. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem, in which we minimize a measure of perceptual dissimilarity, the Normalized Laplacian Pyramid Distance (NLPD), which mimics the early stage transformations of the human visual system. When rendering images acquired with higher dynamic range than that of the display, we find that the optimized solution boosts the contrast of low-contrast features without introducing significant artifacts, yielding results of comparable visual quality to current state-of-the art methods with no manual intervention or parameter settings. We also examine a variety of other display constraints, including limitations on minimum luminance (black point), mean luminance (as a proxy for energy consumption), and quantized luminance levels (halftoning). Finally, we show that the method may be used to enhance details and contrast of images degraded by optical scattering (e.g. fog).",0
"The Ant Colony System (ACS) is, next to Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and the MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS), one of the most efficient metaheuristic algorithms inspired by the behavior of ants. In this article we present three novel parallel versions of the ACS for the graphics processing units (GPUs). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such work on the ACS which shares many key elements of the ACO and the MMAS, but differences in the process of building solutions and updating the pheromone trails make obtaining an efficient parallel version for the GPUs a difficult task. The proposed parallel versions of the ACS differ mainly in their implementations of the pheromone memory. The first two use the standard pheromone matrix, and the third uses a novel selective pheromone memory. Computational experiments conducted on several Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances of sizes ranging from 198 to 2392 cities showed that the parallel ACS on Nvidia Kepler GK104 GPU (1536 CUDA cores) is able to obtain a speedup up to 24.29x vs the sequential ACS running on a single core of Intel Xeon E5-2670 CPU. The parallel ACS with the selective pheromone memory achieved speedups up to 16.85x, but in most cases the obtained solutions were of significantly better quality than for the sequential ACS.",0
"One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way. The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the execution of several environments, including those which are generated randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests, the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated environment will serve that purpose.",0
"Statistical evidence of the influence of neighborhood topology on the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms has been shown in many works. However, little has been done about the implications could have the percolation threshold in determining the topology of this neighborhood. This work addresses this problem for individuals that, like robots, are able to sense in a limited neighborhood around them. Based on the concept of percolation threshold, and more precisely, the disk percolation model in 2D, we show that better results are obtained for low values of radius, when individuals occasionally ask others their best visited positions, with the consequent decrease of computational complexity. On the other hand, since percolation threshold is a universal measure, it could have a great interest to compare the performance of different hybrid PSO algorithms.",0
"Written responses can provide a wealth of data in understanding student reasoning on a topic. Yet they are time- and labor-intensive to score, requiring many instructors to forego them except as limited parts of summative assessments at the end of a unit or course. Recent developments in Machine Learning (ML) have produced computational methods of scoring written responses for the presence or absence of specific concepts. Here, we compare the scores from one particular ML program -- EvoGrader -- to human scoring of responses to structurally- and content-similar questions that are distinct from the ones the program was trained on. We find that there is substantial inter-rater reliability between the human and ML scoring. However, sufficient systematic differences remain between the human and ML scoring that we advise only using the ML scoring for formative, rather than summative, assessment of student reasoning.",0
"A model checker can produce a trace of counterexample, for an erroneous program, which is often long and difficult to understand. In general, the part about the loops is the largest among the instructions in this trace. This makes the location of errors in loops critical, to analyze errors in the overall program. In this paper, we explore the scalability capabilities of LocFaults, our error localization approach exploiting paths of CFG(Control Flow Graph) from a counterexample to calculate the MCDs (Minimal Correction Deviations), and MCSs (Minimal Correction Subsets) from each found MCD. We present the times of our approach on programs with While-loops unfolded b times, and a number of deviated conditions ranging from 0 to n. Our preliminary results show that the times of our approach, constraint-based and flow-driven, are better compared to BugAssist which is based on SAT and transforms the entire program to a Boolean formula, and further the information provided by LocFaults is more expressive for the user.",0
"This paper describes a graph clustering algorithm that aims to minimize the normalized cut criterion and has a model order selection procedure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to spectral approaches in terms of minimizing normalized cut. However, unlike spectral approaches, the proposed algorithm scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The algorithm consists of three components that are processed sequentially: a greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure, model order selection, and a local refinement.",0
"With the advancement of huge data generation and data handling capability, Machine Learning and Probabilistic modelling enables an immense opportunity to employ predictive analytics platform in high security critical industries namely data centers, electricity grids, utilities, airport etc. where downtime minimization is one of the primary objectives. This paper proposes a novel, complete architecture of an intelligent predictive analytics platform, Fault Engine, for huge device network connected with electrical/information flow. Three unique modules, here proposed, seamlessly integrate with available technology stack of data handling and connect with middleware to produce online intelligent prediction in critical failure scenarios. The Markov Failure module predicts the severity of a failure along with survival probability of a device at any given instances. The Root Cause Analysis model indicates probable devices as potential root cause employing Bayesian probability assignment and topological sort. Finally, a community detection algorithm produces correlated clusters of device in terms of failure probability which will further narrow down the search space of finding route cause. The whole Engine has been tested with different size of network with simulated failure environments and shows its potential to be scalable in real-time implementation.",0
"As fragments of first-order logic, Description logics (DLs) do not provide nonmonotonic features such as defeasible inheritance and default rules. Since many applications would benefit from the availability of such features, several families of nonmonotonic DLs have been developed that are mostly based on default logic and autoepistemic logic. In this paper, we consider circumscription as an interesting alternative approach to nonmonotonic DLs that, in particular, supports defeasible inheritance in a natural way. We study DLs extended with circumscription under different language restrictions and under different constraints on the sets of minimized, fixed, and varying predicates, and pinpoint the exact computational complexity of reasoning for DLs ranging from ALC to ALCIO and ALCQO. When the minimized and fixed predicates include only concept names but no role names, then reasoning is complete for NExpTime^NP. It becomes complete for NP^NExpTime when the number of minimized and fixed predicates is bounded by a constant. If roles can be minimized or fixed, then complexity ranges from NExpTime^NP to undecidability.",0
"Supplier selection is a typical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and lots of uncertain information exist inevitably. To address this issue, a new method was proposed based on interval data fusion. Our method follows the original way to generate classical basic probability assignment(BPA) determined by the distance among the evidences. However, the weights of criteria are kept as interval numbers to generate interval BPAs and do the fusion of interval BPAs. Finally, the order is ranked and the decision is made according to the obtained interval BPAs. In this paper, a numerical example of supplier selection is applied to verify the feasibility and validity of our method. The new method is presented aiming at solving multiple-criteria decision-making problems in which the weights of criteria or experts are described in fuzzy data like linguistic terms or interval data.",0
"Existing algorithms for subgroup discovery with numerical targets do not optimize the error or target variable dispersion of the groups they find. This often leads to unreliable or inconsistent statements about the data, rendering practical applications, especially in scientific domains, futile. Therefore, we here extend the optimistic estimator framework for optimal subgroup discovery to a new class of objective functions: we show how tight estimators can be computed efficiently for all functions that are determined by subgroup size (non-decreasing dependence), the subgroup median value, and a dispersion measure around the median (non-increasing dependence). In the important special case when dispersion is measured using the average absolute deviation from the median, this novel approach yields a linear time algorithm. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets shows that, when used within branch-and-bound search, this approach is highly efficient and indeed discovers subgroups with much smaller errors.",0
"Multi-context systems provide a powerful framework for modelling information-aggregation systems featuring heterogeneous reasoning components. Their execution can, however, incur non-negligible cost. Here, we focus on cost-complexity of such systems. To that end, we introduce cost-aware multi-context systems, an extension of non-monotonic multi-context systems framework taking into account costs incurred by execution of semantic operators of the individual contexts. We formulate the notion of cost-complexity for consistency and reasoning problems in MCSs. Subsequently, we provide a series of results related to gradually more and more constrained classes of MCSs and finally introduce an incremental cost-reducing algorithm solving the reasoning problem for definite MCSs.",0
"In addressing the challenge of exponential scaling with the number of agents we adopt a cluster-based representation to approximately solve asymmetric games of very many players. A cluster groups together agents with a similar ""strategic view"" of the game. We learn the clustered approximation from data consisting of strategy profiles and payoffs, which may be obtained from observations of play or access to a simulator. Using our clustering we construct a reduced ""twins"" game in which each cluster is associated with two players of the reduced game. This allows our representation to be individually- responsive because we align the interests of every individual agent with the strategy of its cluster. Our approach provides agents with higher payoffs and lower regret on average than model-free methods as well as previous cluster-based methods, and requires only few observations for learning to be successful. The ""twins"" approach is shown to be an important component of providing these low regret approximations.",0
"Objective. To pilot test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV testing messaging in a population of homeless youth. Methods. We recruited and assessed 62 youth at baseline, 1 month (n = 48), and 3 months (n = 38). A Facebook app collected preliminary social network data. Eleven PCAs selected by AI attended a 1-day training and 7 weekly booster sessions. Mixed-effects models with random effects were used to assess change over time. Results. Significant change over time was observed in past 6-month HIV testing (57.9%, 82.4%, 76.3%; p &lt; .05) but not condom use (63.9%, 65.7%, 65.8%). Most youth reported speaking to a PCA about HIV prevention (72.0% at 1 month, 61.5% at 3 months). Conclusions. AI is a promising avenue for implementing PCA models for homeless youth. Increasing rates of regular HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention and linking homeless youth to treatment.",0
"The technology in the area of automated vehicles is gaining speed and promises many advantages. However, with the recent introduction of conditionally automated driving, we have also seen accidents. Test protocols for both, conditionally automated (e.g., on highways) and automated vehicles do not exist yet and leave researchers and practitioners with different challenges. For instance, current test procedures do not suffice for fully automated vehicles, which are supposed to be completely in charge for the driving task and have no driver as a back up. This paper presents current challenges of testing the functionality and safety of automated vehicles derived from conducting focus groups and interviews with 26 participants from five countries having a background related to testing automotive safety-related topics.We provide an overview of the state-of-practice of testing active safety features as well as challenges that needs to be addressed in the future to ensure safety for automated vehicles. The major challenges identified through the interviews and focus groups, enriched by literature on this topic are related to 1) virtual testing and simulation, 2) safety, reliability, and quality, 3) sensors and sensor models, 4) required scenario complexity and amount of test cases, and 5) handover of responsibility between the driver and the vehicle.",0
"There is currently an intersection in the research of game theory and cryptography. Generally speaking, there are two aspects to this partnership. First there is the application of game theory to cryptography. Yet, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the second aspect, the converse of the first, the application of cryptography to game theory. Chiefly, there exist a branch of non-cooperative games which have a correlated equilibrium as their solution. These equilibria tend to be superior to the conventional Nash equilibria. The primary condition for a correlated equilibrium is the presence of a mediator within the game. This is simply a neutral and mutually trusted entity. It is the role of the mediator to make recommendations in terms of strategy profiles to all players, who then act (supposedly) on this advice. Each party privately provides the mediator with the necessary information, and the referee responds privately with their optimized strategy set. However, there seem to be a multitude of situations in which no mediator could exist. Thus, games modeling these sorts of cases could not use these entities as tools for analysis. Yet, if these equilibria are in the best interest of players, it would be rational to construct a machine, or protocol, to calculate them. Of course, this machine would need to satisfy some standard for secure transmission between a player and itself. The requirement that no third party could detect either the input or strategy profile would need to be satisfied by this scheme. Here is the synthesis of cryptography into game theory; analyzing the ability of the players to construct a protocol which can be used successfully in the place of a mediator.",0
"Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse, delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete MDP with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.",1
"The domain of single crossing preference profiles is a widely studied domain in social choice theory. It has been generalized to the domain of single crossing preference profiles with respect to trees which inherits many desirable properties from the single crossing domain, for example, transitivity of majority relation, existence of polynomial time algorithms for finding winners of Kemeny voting rule, etc. In this paper, we consider a further generalization of the domain of single crossing profiles on trees to the domain consisting of all preference profiles which can be extended to single crossing preference profiles with respect to some tree by adding more preferences to it. We call this domain the weakly single crossing domain on trees. We present a polynomial time algorithm for recognizing weakly single crossing profiles on trees. We then move on to develop a polynomial time algorithm with low query complexity for eliciting weakly single crossing profiles on trees even when we do not know any tree with respect to which the closure of the input profile is single crossing and the preferences can be queried only sequentially; moreover, the sequential order is also unknown. We complement the performance of our preference elicitation algorithm by proving that our algorithm makes an optimal number of queries up to constant factors when the number of preferences is large compared to the number of candidates, even if the input profile is known to be single crossing with respect to some given tree and the preferences can be accessed randomly.",0
"We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on a few-shot image classification benchmark, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.",1
"Correct inference of genetic regulations inside a cell is one of the greatest challenges in post genomic era for the biologist and researchers. Several intelligent techniques and models were already proposed to identify the regulatory relations among genes from the biological database like time series microarray data. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is one of the most popular and simple approach to model the dynamics as well as to infer correct dependencies among genes. In this paper, Bat Algorithm (BA) was applied to optimize the model parameters of RNN model of Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). Initially the proposed method is tested against small artificial network without any noise and the efficiency was observed in term of number of iteration, number of population and BA optimization parameters. The model was also validated in presence of different level of random noise for the small artificial network and that proved its ability to infer the correct inferences in presence of noise like real world dataset. In the next phase of this research, BA based RNN is applied to real world benchmark time series microarray dataset of E. Coli. The results shown that it can able to identify the maximum true positive regulation but also include some false positive regulations. Therefore, BA is very suitable for identifying biological plausible GRN with the help RNN model",0
"It is well-known that exploiting label correlations is important to multi-label learning. Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the full-label and the missing-label cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds. The extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data.",0
"We study Matching, Clustering, and related problems in a partial information setting, where the agents' true utilities are hidden, and the algorithm only has access to ordinal preference information. Our model is motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph of agent utilities, but the algorithm receives as input only a preference ordering for each agent induced by the underlying weights. Against this backdrop, we design algorithms to approximate the true optimum solution with respect to the hidden weights. Perhaps surprisingly, such algorithms are possible for many important problems, as we show using our framework based on greedy and random techniques. Our framework yields a 1.6-approximation algorithm for the maximum weighted matching problem, a 2-approximation for the problem of clustering agents into equal sized partitions, a 4-approximation algorithm for Densest $k$-subgraph, and a 1.88-approximation algorithm for Max TSP as long as the hidden weights constitute a metric. Our results are the first non-trivial ordinal approximation algorithms for such problems, and indicate that in many situations, we can design robust algorithms even when we are agnostic to the precise agent utilities.",0
"This paper reveals the tree structure as an intermediate result of clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (DPCLUS), and explores the power of using this tree to perform hierarchical clustering. The array used to hold the index of the nearest higher-densitied object for each object can be transformed into a Leading Tree (LT), in which each parent node P leads its child nodes to join the same cluster as P itself, and the child nodes are sorted by their g values in descendant order to accelerate the disconnecting of root in each subtree. There are two major advantages with the LT: One is dramatically reducing the running time of assigning noncenter data points to their cluster ID, because the assigning process is turned into just disconnecting the links from each center to its parent. The other is that the tree model for representing clusters is more informative. Because we can check which objects are more likely to be selected as centers in finer grained clustering, or which objects reach to its center via less jumps. Experiment results and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the assigning process with an LT.",0
"In this paper, we consider planning in stochastic shortest path (SSP) problems, a subclass of Markov Decision Problems (MDP). We focus on medium-size problems whose state space can be fully enumerated. This problem has numerous important applications, such as navigation and planning under uncertainty. We propose a new approach for constructing a multi-level hierarchy of progressively simpler abstractions of the original problem. Once computed, the hierarchy can be used to speed up planning by first finding a policy for the most abstract level and then recursively refining it into a solution to the original problem. This approach is fully automated and delivers a speed-up of two orders of magnitude over a state-of-the-art MDP solver on sample problems while returning near-optimal solutions. We also prove theoretical bounds on the loss of solution optimality resulting from the use of abstractions.",0
"Role discovery in graphs is an emerging area that allows analysis of complex graphs in an intuitive way. In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.",0
"In animal monitoring applications, both animal detection and their movement prediction are major tasks. While a variety of animal monitoring strategies exist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is difficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we propose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is to detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and monitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application, sensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering animal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the information from sensors. To achieve the information efficiently, we propose a path planning approach for the UAV based on a Markov decision process (MDP) model. The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals are detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the UAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before. Meanwhile, the UAV explores other areas as well to cover the entire network and detects changes in the animal positions. We first define the mathematical model underlying the animal monitoring problem in terms of the value of information (VoI) and rewards. We propose a network model including clusters of sensor nodes and a single UAV that acts as a mobile sink and visits the clusters. Then, one MDP-based path planning approach is designed to maximize the VoI while reducing message delays. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using two real-world movement datasets of zebras and leopard. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms greedy, random heuristics and the path planning based on the traveling salesman problem.",0
"In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.",0
"As computer clusters become more common and the size of the problems encountered in the field of AI grows, there is an increasing demand for efficient parallel inference algorithms. We consider the problem of parallel inference on large factor graphs in the distributed memory setting of computer clusters. We develop a new efficient parallel inference algorithm, DBRSplash, which incorporates over-segmented graph partitioning, belief residual scheduling, and uniform work Splash operations. We empirically evaluate the DBRSplash algorithm on a 120 processor cluster and demonstrate linear to super-linear performance gains on large factor graph models.",0
"Deciding how to act in partially observable environments remains an active area of research. Identifying good sequences of decisions is particularly challenging when good control performance requires planning multiple steps into the future in domains with many states. Towards addressing this challenge, we present an online, forward-search algorithm called the Posterior Belief Distribution (PBD). PBD leverages a novel method for calculating the posterior distribution over beliefs that result after a sequence of actions is taken, given the set of observation sequences that could be received during this process. This method allows us to efficiently evaluate the expected reward of a sequence of primitive actions, which we refer to as macro-actions. We present a formal analysis of our approach, and examine its performance on two very large simulation experiments: scientific exploration and a target monitoring domain. We also demonstrate our algorithm being used to control a real robotic helicopter in a target monitoring experiment, which suggests that our approach has practical potential for planning in real-world, large partially observable domains where a multi-step lookahead is required to achieve good performance.",0
"We address a dynamic repair shop scheduling problem in the context of military aircraft fleet management where the goal is to maintain a full complement of aircraft over the long-term. A number of flights, each with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft, are already scheduled over a long horizon. We need to assign aircraft to flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights requirements, repair capacity, and aircraft failures. The number of aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online. To solve the problem, we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static repair scheduling sub-problems over shorter time periods. We propose a complete approach based on the logic-based Benders decomposition to solve the static sub-problems, and design different rescheduling policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop. Computational experiments demonstrate that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming model. The rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft available in the long term by 10% compared to the approaches having either one of the aspects alone.",0
"What is the nature of curiosity? Is there any scientific way to understand the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the stupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their smartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this problem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and intelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.",0
"The proliferation of heterogeneous data sources of semantic knowledge base intensifies the need of an automatic instance matching technique. However, the efficiency of instance matching is often influenced by the weight of a property associated to instances. Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however an important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an appropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is nevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of generating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a property is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct values to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is also proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property to the number of instances in a training dataset. The basic intuition behind the use of our approach is the classical theory of information content that infrequent words are more informative than frequent ones. Our mathematical model derives a metric for generating property weights automatically, which is applied in instance matching system to produce re-conciliated instances efficiently. Our experiments and evaluations show the effectiveness of our proposed metric of automatic weight generation for properties in an instance matching technique.",0
"In recent years there is a growing interest in using deep representations for reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present a methodology and tools to analyze Deep Q-networks (DQNs) in a non-blind matter. Using our tools we reveal that the features learned by DQNs aggregate the state space in a hierarchical fashion, explaining its success. Moreover we are able to understand and describe the policies learned by DQNs for three different Atari2600 games and suggest ways to interpret, debug and optimize of deep neural networks in Reinforcement Learning.",1
"Views are a standard abstraction in constraint programming: They make it possible to implement a single version of each constraint, while avoiding to create new variables and constraints that would slow down propagation. Traditional constraint-programming systems provide the concept of {\em variable views} which implement a view of the type $y = f(x)$ by delegating all (domain and constraint) operations on variable $y$ to variable $x$. This paper proposes the alternative concept of {\em domain views} which only delegate domain operations. Domain views preserve the benefits of variable views but simplify the implementation of value-based propagation. Domain views also support non-injective views compositionally, expanding the scope of views significantly. Experimental results demonstrate the practical benefits of domain views.",0
"The agent program, called Samu, is an experiment to build a disembodied DevRob (Developmental Robotics) chatter bot that can talk in a natural language like humans do. One of the main design feature is that Samu can be interacted with using only a character terminal. This is important not only for practical aspects of Turing test or Loebner prize, but also for the study of basic principles of Developmental Robotics. Our purpose is to create a rapid prototype of Q-learning with neural network approximators for Samu. We sketch out the early stages of the development process of this prototype, where Samu's task is to predict the next sentence of tales or conversations. The basic objective of this paper is to reach the same results using reinforcement learning with general function approximators that can be achieved by using the classical Q lookup table on small input samples. The paper is closed by an experiment that shows a significant improvement in Samu's learning when using LZW tree to narrow the number of possible Q-actions.",0
"We propose a framework for detecting action patterns from motion sequences and modeling the sensory-motor relationship of animals, using a generative recurrent neural network. The network has a discriminative part (classifying actions) and a generative part (predicting motion), whose recurrent cells are laterally connected, allowing higher levels of the network to represent high level phenomena. We test our framework on two types of data, fruit fly behavior and online handwriting. Our results show that 1) taking advantage of unlabeled sequences, by predicting future motion, significantly improves action detection performance when training labels are scarce, 2) the network learns to represent high level phenomena such as writer identity and fly gender, without supervision, and 3) simulated motion trajectories, generated by treating motion prediction as input to the network, look realistic and may be used to qualitatively evaluate whether the model has learnt generative control rules.",1
"The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems, with differentiable or non-differentiable objective functions. Unfortunately, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, which makes ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method to adaptively tune the penalty parameters to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.",0
"Data quantization learns encoding results of data with certain requirements, and provides a broad perspective of many real-world applications to data handling. Nevertheless, the results of encoder is usually limited to multivariate inputs with the random mapping, and side information of binary codes are hardly to mostly depict the original data patterns as possible. In the literature, cosine based random quantization has attracted much attentions due to its intrinsic bounded results. Nevertheless, it usually suffers from the uncertain outputs, and information of original data fails to be fully preserved in the reduced codes. In this work, a novel binary embedding method, termed adaptive training quantization (ATQ), is proposed to learn the ideal transform of random encoder, where the limitation of cosine random mapping is tackled. As an adaptive learning idea, the reduced mapping is adaptively calculated with idea of data group, while the bias of random transform is to be improved to hold most matching information. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to obtain outstanding performance compared with other random quantization methods.",0
"The interdisciplinary nature of the Semantic Web and the many projects put forward by the community led to a large number of widely accepted serialization formats for RDF. Most of these RDF syntaxes have been developed out of a necessity to serve specific purposes better than existing ones, e.g. RDFa was proposed as an extension to HTML for embedding non-intrusive RDF statements in human-readable documents. Nonetheless, the RDF serialization formats are generally transducible among themselves given that they are commonly based on the RDF model. In this paper, we present (1) a RESTful Web service based on the HTTP protocol that translates between different serializations. In addition to its core functionality, our proposed solution provides (2) features to accommodate frequent needs of Semantic Web developers, namely a straightforward user interface with copy-to-clipboard functionality, syntax highlighting, persistent URI links for easy sharing, cool URI patterns, and content negotiation using respective HTTP headers. We demonstrate the benefit of our converter by presenting two use cases.",0
"This paper presents a study of employing Ranking SVM and Convolutional Neural Network for two missions: legal information retrieval and question answering in the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment. For the first task, our proposed model used a triple of features (LSI, Manhattan, Jaccard), and is based on paragraph level instead of article level as in previous studies. In fact, each single-paragraph article corresponds to a particular paragraph in a huge multiple-paragraph article. For the legal question answering task, additional statistical features from information retrieval task integrated into Convolutional Neural Network contribute to higher accuracy.",0
"Today's artificial assistants are typically prompted to perform tasks through direct, imperative commands such as \emph{Set a timer} or \emph{Pick up the box}. However, to progress toward more natural exchanges between humans and these assistants, it is important to understand the way non-imperative utterances can indirectly elicit action of an addressee. In this paper, we investigate command types in the setting of a grounded, collaborative game. We focus on a less understood family of utterances for eliciting agent action, locatives like \emph{The chair is in the other room}, and demonstrate how these utterances indirectly command in specific game state contexts. Our work shows that models with domain-specific grounding can effectively realize the pragmatic reasoning that is necessary for more robust natural language interaction with robots.",0
"One of the simplest metalearning methods is the average ranking method. This method uses metadata in the form of test results of a given set of algorithms on given set of datasets and calculates an average rank for each algorithm. The ranks are used to construct the average ranking. We investigate the problem of how the process of generating the average ranking is affected by incomplete metadata including fewer test results. This issue is relevant, because if we could show that incomplete metadata does not affect the final results much, we could explore it in future design. We could simply conduct fewer tests and save thus computation time. In this paper we describe an upgraded average ranking method that is capable of dealing with incomplete metadata. Our results show that the proposed method is relatively robust to omission in test results in the meta datasets.",0
"In our work we define a new algebra of operators as a substitute for fuzzy logic. Its primary purpose is for construction of binary discriminators for phonemes based on spectral content. It is optimized for design of non-parametric computational circuits, and makes uses of 4 operations: $\min$, $\max$, the difference and generalized additively homogenuous means.",0
"We consider a class of probabilistic grammars for generating scenes with multiple objects. Probabilistic scene grammars capture relationships between objects using compositional rules that provide important contextual cues for inference with ambiguous data. We show how to represent the distribution defined by a probabilistic scene grammar using a factor graph. We also show how to efficiently perform message passing in this factor graph. This leads to an efficient approach for inference with a grammar model using belief propagation as the underlying computational engine. Inference with belief propagation naturally combines bottom-up and top-down contextual information and leads to a robust algorithm for aggregating evidence. We show experiments on two different applications to demonstrate the generality of the framework. The first application involves detecting curves in noisy images, and we address this problem using a grammar that generates a collection of curves using a first-order Markov process. The second application involves localizing faces and parts of faces in images. In this case, we use a grammar that captures spatial relationships between the parts of a face. In both applications the same framework leads to robust inference algorithms that can effectively combine weak local information to reason about a scene.",0
"Theory refinement is the task of updating a domain theory in the light of new cases, to be done automatically or with some expert assistance. The problem of theory refinement under uncertainty is reviewed here in the context of Bayesian statistics, a theory of belief revision. The problem is reduced to an incremental learning task as follows: the learning system is initially primed with a partial theory supplied by a domain expert, and thereafter maintains its own internal representation of alternative theories which is able to be interrogated by the domain expert and able to be incrementally refined from data. Algorithms for refinement of Bayesian networks are presented to illustrate what is meant by ""partial theory"", ""alternative theory representation"", etc. The algorithms are an incremental variant of batch learning algorithms from the literature so can work well in batch and incremental mode.",0
"We present a general architecture for the monitoring and diagnosis of large scale sensor-based systems with real time diagnostic constraints. This architecture is multileveled, combining a single monitoring level based on statistical methods with two model based diagnostic levels. At each level, sources of uncertainty are identified, and integrated methodologies for uncertainty management are developed. The general architecture was applied to the monitoring and diagnosis of a specific nuclear physics detector at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that contained approximately 5000 components and produced over 500 channels of output data. The general architecture is scalable, and work is ongoing to apply it to detector systems one and two orders of magnitude more complex.",0
"The first decade of this century has seen the nascency of the first mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric. Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without even providing the rules of the games.",0
"This paper presents Networks of Influence Diagrams (NID), a compact, natural and highly expressive language for reasoning about agents beliefs and decision-making processes. NIDs are graphical structures in which agents mental models are represented as nodes in a network; a mental model for an agent may itself use descriptions of the mental models of other agents. NIDs are demonstrated by examples, showing how they can be used to describe conflicting and cyclic belief structures, and certain forms of bounded rationality. In an opponent modeling domain, NIDs were able to outperform other computational agents whose strategies were not known in advance. NIDs are equivalent in representation to Bayesian games but they are more compact and structured than this formalism. In particular, the equilibrium definition for NIDs makes an explicit distinction between agents optimal strategies, and how they actually behave in reality.",0
"The use of Artificial Intelligence is finding prominence not only in core computer areas, but also in cross disciplinary areas including medical diagnosis. In this paper, we present a rule based Expert System used in diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. The expert system takes user input and depending on the symptoms of the patient, diagnoses if the patient is suffering from Cerebral Palsy. The Expert System also classifies the Cerebral Palsy as mild, moderate or severe based on the presented symptoms.",0
"An approach to fault isolation that exploits vastly incomplete models is presented. It relies on separate descriptions of each component behavior, together with the links between them, which enables focusing of the reasoning to the relevant part of the system. As normal observations do not need explanation, the behavior of the components is limited to anomaly propagation. Diagnostic solutions are disorders (fault modes or abnormal signatures) that are consistent with the observations, as well as abductive explanations. An ordinal representation of uncertainty based on possibility theory provides a simple exception-tolerant description of the component behaviors. We can for instance distinguish between effects that are more or less certainly present (or absent) and effects that are more or less certainly present (or absent) when a given anomaly is present. A realistic example illustrates the benefits of this approach.",0
"Policy iteration (PI) is a recursive process of policy evaluation and improvement to solve an optimal decision-making, e.g., reinforcement learning (RL) or optimal control problem and has served as the fundamental to develop RL methods. Motivated by integral PI (IPI) schemes in optimal control and RL methods in continuous time and space (CTS), this paper proposes on-policy IPI to solve the general RL problem in CTS, with its environment modeled by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). In such continuous domain, we also propose four off-policy IPI methods---two are the ideal PI forms that use advantage and Q-functions, respectively, and the other two are natural extensions of the existing off-policy IPI schemes to our general RL framework. Compared to the IPI methods in optimal control, the proposed IPI schemes can be applied to more general situations and do not require an initial stabilizing policy to run; they are also strongly relevant to the RL algorithms in CTS such as advantage updating, Q-learning, and value-gradient based (VGB) greedy policy improvement. Our on-policy IPI is basically model-based but can be made partially model-free; each off-policy method is also either partially or completely model-free. The mathematical properties of the IPI methods---admissibility, monotone improvement, and convergence towards the optimal solution---are all rigorously proven, together with the equivalence of on- and off-policy IPI. Finally, the IPI methods are simulated with an inverted-pendulum model to support the theory and verify the performance.",0
"Conditioning is the primary method for belief revision in data fusion systems employing probabilistic inferencing. However, big-data environments, where soft (i.e., human or human-based) sources are commonly utilized in addition to hard (i.e., physics-based sensors, pose several challenges to traditional conditioning tasks primarily due to the numerous data/source imperfections that are characteristic of such data. The objective of this paper is to investigate the most natural extension of Bayes conditioning based evidence updates in the presence of such large-scale data uncertainties and source/sensor imperfections. By viewing the evidence updating process as a thought experiment, we devise an elegant strategy for robust evidence updating in the presence of extreme uncertainties characteristic of big-data environments. In particular, we look at the formulation of a belief theoretic evidence updating mechanism that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional approach when the incoming evidence takes the form of a general belief function. Proposed method generalizes the belief theoretic Fagin-Halpern conditional notion, and provides a novel evidence updating strategy that is derived as a natural extension of Bayes conditional applied in a highly uncertain and complex fusion scenario that is characteristic of big-data environments. The presented extension differs fundamentally from the previously published work on Conditional Update Equation (CUE) as well as authors own work. An overview of this development is provided via illustrative examples. Furthermore, insights into parameter selection under various fusion contexts are also provided.",0
"Any agent that is part of the environment it interacts with and has versatile actuators (such as arms and fingers), will in principle have the ability to self-modify -- for example by changing its own source code. As we continue to create more and more intelligent agents, chances increase that they will learn about this ability. The question is: will they want to use it? For example, highly intelligent systems may find ways to change their goals to something more easily achievable, thereby `escaping' the control of their designers. In an important paper, Omohundro (2008) argued that goal preservation is a fundamental drive of any intelligent system, since a goal is more likely to be achieved if future versions of the agent strive towards the same goal. In this paper, we formalise this argument in general reinforcement learning, and explore situations where it fails. Our conclusion is that the self-modification possibility is harmless if and only if the value function of the agent anticipates the consequences of self-modifications and use the current utility function when evaluating the future.",0
"In group decision making (GDM) problems fuzzy preference relations (FPR) are widely used for representing decision makers' opinions on the set of alternatives. In order to avoid misleading solutions, the study of consistency and consensus has become a very important aspect. This article presents a simulated annealing (SA) based soft computing approach to optimize the consistency/consensus level (CCL) of a complete fuzzy preference relation in order to solve a GDM problem. Consistency level indicates as expert's preference quality and consensus level measures the degree of agreement among experts' opinions. This study also suggests the set of experts for the necessary modifications in their prescribed preference structures without intervention of any moderator.",0
"Marginal MAP inference involves making MAP predictions in systems defined with latent variables or missing information. It is significantly more difficult than pure marginalization and MAP tasks, for which a large class of efficient and convergent variational algorithms, such as dual decomposition, exist. In this work, we generalize dual decomposition to a generic power sum inference task, which includes marginal MAP, along with pure marginalization and MAP, as special cases. Our method is based on a block coordinate descent algorithm on a new convex decomposition bound, that is guaranteed to converge monotonically, and can be parallelized efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on marginal MAP queries defined on real-world problems from the UAI approximate inference challenge, showing that our framework is faster and more reliable than previous methods.",1
"This paper is concerned with algorithms for prediction of discrete sequences over a finite alphabet, using variable order Markov models. The class of such algorithms is large and in principle includes any lossless compression algorithm. We focus on six prominent prediction algorithms, including Context Tree Weighting (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) and Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs). We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare their performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins, English text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to prediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare classification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of large protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a ""decomposed"" CTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in sequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which is a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly outperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems.",0
"Syllogism is a type of deductive reasoning involving quantified statements. The syllogistic reasoning scheme in the classical Aristotelian framework involves three crisp term sets and four linguistic quantifiers, for which the main support is the linguistic properties of the quantifiers. A number of fuzzy approaches for defining an approximate syllogism have been proposed for which the main support is cardinality calculus. In this paper we analyze fuzzy syllogistic models previously described by Zadeh and Dubois et al. and compare their behavior with that of the classical Aristotelian framework to check which of the 24 classical valid syllogistic reasoning patterns or moods are particular crisp cases of these fuzzy approaches. This allows us to assess to what extent these approaches can be considered as either plausible extensions of the classical crisp syllogism or a basis for a general approach to the problem of approximate syllogism.",0
"Case-based reasoning (CBR) based on description logics (DLs) has gained a lot of attention lately. Adaptation is a basic task in the CBR inference that can be modeled as the knowledge base revision problem and solved in propositional logic. However, in DLs, it is still a challenge problem since existing revision operators only work well for strictly restricted DLs of the \emph{DL-Lite} family, and it is difficult to design a revision algorithm which is syntax-independent and fine-grained. In this paper, we present a new method for adaptation based on the DL $\mathcal{EL_{\bot}}$. Following the idea of adaptation as revision, we firstly extend the logical basis for describing cases from propositional logic to the DL $\mathcal{EL_{\bot}}$, and present a formalism for adaptation based on $\mathcal{EL_{\bot}}$. Then we present an adaptation algorithm for this formalism and demonstrate that our algorithm is syntax-independent and fine-grained. Our work provides a logical basis for adaptation in CBR systems where cases and domain knowledge are described by the tractable DL $\mathcal{EL_{\bot}}$.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful modelling formalism that is very efficient in solving combinatorial problems. ASP solvers implement the stable model semantics that eliminates circular derivations between Boolean variables from the solutions of a logic program. Due to this, ASP solvers are better suited than propositional satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP) solvers to solve a certain class of problems whose specification includes inductive definitions such as reachability in a graph. On the other hand, ASP solvers suffer from the grounding bottleneck that occurs due to their inability to model finite domain variables. Furthermore, the existing stable model semantics are not sufficient to disallow circular reasoning on the bounds of numeric variables. An example where this is required is in modelling shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Just as reachability can be encoded as an inductive definition with one or more base cases and recursive rules, shortest paths between nodes can also be modelled with similar base cases and recursive rules for their upper bounds. This deficiency of stable model semantics introduces another type of grounding bottleneck in ASP systems that cannot be removed by naively merging ASP with CP solvers, but requires a theoretical extension of the semantics from Booleans and normal rules to bounds over numeric variables and more general rules. In this work, we propose Bound Founded Answer Set Programming (BFASP) that resolves this issue and consequently, removes all types of grounding bottleneck inherent in ASP systems.",0
"The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) is a well-known matching problem first introduced and solved by Gale and Shapley (1962). Several variants and extensions to this problem have since been investigated to cover a wider set of applications. Each time a new variant is considered, however, a new algorithm needs to be developed and implemented. As an alternative, in this paper we propose an encoding of the SMP using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our encoding can easily be extended and adapted to the needs of specific applications. As an illustration we show how stable matchings can be found when individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed. Subsequently, we show how our ASP based encoding naturally allows us to select specific stable matchings which are optimal according to a given criterion. Each time, we can rely on generic and efficient off-the-shelf answer set solvers to find (optimal) stable matchings.",0
"The media industry is increasingly personalizing the offering of contents in attempt to better target the audience. This requires to analyze the relationships that goes established between users and content they enjoy, looking at one side to the content characteristics and on the other to the user profile, in order to find the best match between the two. In this paper we suggest to build that relationship using the Dempster-Shafer's Theory of Evidence, proposing a reference model and illustrating its properties by means of a toy example. Finally we suggest possible applications of the model for tasks that are common in the modern media industry.",0
"Module extraction - the task of computing a (preferably small) fragment M of an ontology T that preserves entailments over a signature S - has found many applications in recent years. Extracting modules of minimal size is, however, computationally hard, and often algorithmically infeasible. Thus, practical techniques are based on approximations, where M provably captures the relevant entailments, but is not guaranteed to be minimal. Existing approximations, however, ensure that M preserves all second-order entailments of T w.r.t. S, which is stronger than is required in many applications, and may lead to large modules in practice. In this paper we propose a novel approach in which module extraction is reduced to a reasoning problem in datalog. Our approach not only generalises existing approximations in an elegant way, but it can also be tailored to preserve only specific kinds of entailments, which allows us to extract significantly smaller modules. An evaluation on widely-used ontologies has shown very encouraging results.",1
"Partial monitoring games are repeated games where the learner receives feedback that might be different from adversary's move or even the reward gained by the learner. Recently, a general model of combinatorial partial monitoring (CPM) games was proposed \cite{lincombinatorial2014}, where the learner's action space can be exponentially large and adversary samples its moves from a bounded, continuous space, according to a fixed distribution. The paper gave a confidence bound based algorithm (GCB) that achieves $O(T^{2/3}\log T)$ distribution independent and $O(\log T)$ distribution dependent regret bounds. The implementation of their algorithm depends on two separate offline oracles and the distribution dependent regret additionally requires existence of a unique optimal action for the learner. Adopting their CPM model, our first contribution is a Phased Exploration with Greedy Exploitation (PEGE) algorithmic framework for the problem. Different algorithms within the framework achieve $O(T^{2/3}\sqrt{\log T})$ distribution independent and $O(\log^2 T)$ distribution dependent regret respectively. Crucially, our framework needs only the simpler ""argmax"" oracle from GCB and the distribution dependent regret does not require existence of a unique optimal action. Our second contribution is another algorithm, PEGE2, which combines gap estimation with a PEGE algorithm, to achieve an $O(\log T)$ regret bound, matching the GCB guarantee but removing the dependence on size of the learner's action space. However, like GCB, PEGE2 requires access to both offline oracles and the existence of a unique optimal action. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can be efficiently applied to a CPM problem of practical interest: namely, online ranking with feedback at the top.",1
"Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial samples: maliciously-perturbed samples crafted to yield incorrect model outputs. Such attacks can severely undermine DNN systems, particularly in security-sensitive settings. It was observed that an adversary could easily generate adversarial samples by making a small perturbation on irrelevant feature dimensions that are unnecessary for the current classification task. To overcome this problem, we introduce a defensive mechanism called DeepMask. By identifying and removing unnecessary features in a DNN model, DeepMask limits the capacity an attacker can use generating adversarial samples and therefore increase the robustness against such inputs. Comparing with other defensive approaches, DeepMask is easy to implement and computationally efficient. Experimental results show that DeepMask can increase the performance of state-of-the-art DNN models against adversarial samples.",0
"We study a logic-based approach to versioning of ontologies. Under this view, ontologies provide answers to queries about some vocabulary of interest. The difference between two versions of an ontology is given by the set of queries that receive different answers. We investigate this approach for terminologies given in the description logic EL extended with role inclusions and domain and range restrictions for three distinct types of queries: subsumption, instance, and conjunctive queries. In all three cases, we present polynomial-time algorithms that decide whether two terminologies give the same answers to queries over a given vocabulary and compute a succinct representation of the difference if it is non- empty. We present an implementation, CEX2, of the developed algorithms for subsumption and instance queries and apply it to distinct versions of Snomed CT and the NCI ontology.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is logic programming under the stable model or answer set semantics. During the last decade, this paradigm has seen several extensions by generalizing the notion of atom used in these programs. Among these, there are aggregate atoms, HEX atoms, generalized quantifiers, and abstract constraints. In this paper we refer to these constructs collectively as generalized atoms. The idea common to all of these constructs is that their satisfaction depends on the truth values of a set of (non-generalized) atoms, rather than the truth value of a single (non-generalized) atom. Motivated by several examples, we argue that for some of the more intricate generalized atoms, the previously suggested semantics provide unintuitive results and provide an alternative semantics, which we call supportedly stable or SFLP answer sets. We show that it is equivalent to the major previously proposed semantics for programs with convex generalized atoms, and that it in general admits more intended models than other semantics in the presence of non-convex generalized atoms. We show that the complexity of supportedly stable models is on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, similar to previous proposals and to stable models of disjunctive logic programs. Given these complexity results, we provide a compilation method that compactly transforms programs with generalized atoms in disjunctive normal form to programs without generalized atoms. Variants are given for the new supportedly stable and the existing FLP semantics, for which a similar compilation technique has not been known so far.",0

"The problem of assessing the value of a candidate is viewed here as a multiple combination problem. On the one hand a candidate can be evaluated according to different criteria, and on the other hand several experts are supposed to assess the value of candidates according to each criterion. Criteria are not equally important, experts are not equally competent or reliable. Moreover levels of satisfaction of criteria, or levels of confidence are only assumed to take their values in qualitative scales which are just linearly ordered. The problem is discussed within two frameworks, the transferable belief model and the qualitative possibility theory. They respectively offer a quantitative and a qualitative setting for handling the problem, providing thus a way to compare the nature of the underlying assumptions.",0

"""Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensor motor knowledge. We are all prodigious Olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.""- Hans Moravec Moravec's paradox is involved with the fact that it is the seemingly easier day to day problems that are harder to implement in a machine, than the seemingly complicated logic based problems of today. The results prove that most artificially intelligent machines are as adept if not more than us at under-taking long calculations or even play chess, but their logic brings them nowhere when it comes to carrying out everyday tasks like walking, facial gesture recognition or speech recognition.",0
"An important problem for both graphics and vision is to synthesize novel views of a 3D object from a single image. This is particularly challenging due to the partial observability inherent in projecting a 3D object onto the image space, and the ill-posedness of inferring object shape and pose. However, we can train a neural network to address the problem if we restrict our attention to specific object categories (in our case faces and chairs) for which we can gather ample training data. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of rendering rotated objects starting from a single image. The recurrent structure allows our model to capture long-term dependencies along a sequence of transformations. We demonstrate the quality of its predictions for human faces on the Multi-PIE dataset and for a dataset of 3D chair models, and also show its ability to disentangle latent factors of variation (e.g., identity and pose) without using full supervision.",1
"This paper investigates the problem of finding a preference relation on a set of acts from the knowledge of an ordering on events (subsets of states of the world) describing the decision-maker (DM)s uncertainty and an ordering of consequences of acts, describing the DMs preferences. However, contrary to classical approaches to decision theory, we try to do it without resorting to any numerical representation of utility nor uncertainty, and without even using any qualitative scale on which both uncertainty and preference could be mapped. It is shown that although many axioms of Savage theory can be preserved and despite the intuitive appeal of the method for constructing a preference over acts, the approach is inconsistent with a probabilistic representation of uncertainty, but leads to the kind of uncertainty theory encountered in non-monotonic reasoning (especially preferential and rational inference), closely related to possibility theory. Moreover the method turns out to be either very little decisive or to lead to very risky decisions, although its basic principles look sound. This paper raises the question of the very possibility of purely symbolic approaches to Savage-like decision-making under uncertainty and obtains preliminary negative results.",0
"Handwriting is a natural and versatile method for human-computer interaction, especially on small mobile devices such as smart phones. However, as handwriting varies significantly from person to person, it is difficult to design handwriting recognizers that perform well for all users. A natural solution is to use machine learning to adapt the recognizer to the user. One complicating factor is that, as the computer adapts to the user, the user also adapts to the computer and probably changes their handwriting. This paper investigates the dynamics of co-adaptation, a process in which both the computer and the user are adapting their behaviors in order to improve the speed and accuracy of the communication through handwriting. We devised an information-theoretic framework for quantifying the efficiency of a handwriting system where the system includes both the user and the computer. Using this framework, we analyzed data collected from an adaptive handwriting recognition system and characterized the impact of machine adaptation and of human adaptation. We found that both machine adaptation and human adaptation have significant impact on the input rate and must be considered together in order to improve the efficiency of the system as a whole.",0
"The act of persuasion, a key component in rhetoric argumentation, may be viewed as a dynamics modifier. Such modifiers are well-known in other research fields: recall dynamic epistemic logic where operators modify possible world accessibilities, or recall side effects and concurrency in programming languages. We consider persuasion in abstract argumentation as undertaking a similar role. We extend Dung's frameworks with acts of persuasion among agents into Abstract Persuasion Argumentation (APA), and set forth properties related to arguments' admissibilities. We show a way of enriching our basic notion of admissibility through CTL (computation tree logic) encoding, which also permits importation of the theoretical results known to the logic into our argumentation frameworks.",0
"Large-scale controlled evacuations require emergency services to select evacuation routes, decide departure times, and mobilize resources to issue orders, all under strict time constraints. Existing algorithms almost always allow for preemptive evacuation schedules, which are less desirable in practice. This paper proposes, for the first time, a constraint-based scheduling model that optimizes the evacuation flow rate (number of vehicles sent at regular time intervals) and evacuation phasing of widely populated areas, while ensuring a nonpreemptive evacuation for each residential zone. Two optimization objectives are considered: (1) to maximize the number of evacuees reaching safety and (2) to minimize the overall duration of the evacuation. Preliminary results on a set of real-world instances show that the approach can produce, within a few seconds, a non-preemptive evacuation schedule which is either optimal or at most 6% away of the optimal preemptive solution.",0
"The dynamics of belief and knowledge is one of the major components of any autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. We introduced the knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson's dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics.",0
"This article is about how the ""SP theory of intelligence"", and its realisation in the ""SP machine"", may, with advantage, be applied to the management and analysis of big data. The SP system has potential for the discovery of 'natural' structures in big data at various levels of abstraction, including recurrent patterns and associations, and discontinuous dependencies in data. Potential applications include the discovery of recurrent patterns in economics-related data, in meteorological data, in DNA sequences and amino-acid sequences, and in associations between biochemical structures and diseases. Since information compression is at the heart of the SP system, and since the system has potential to achieve relatively high levels of compression, it may achieve useful reductions in the volume of big data and thus facilitate its storage and management. There is potential for substantial economies in the transmission of big data, and for the efficient processing of compressed data, without the need for decompression. In the interpretation of data, the SP system has capabilities that include such things as the parsing and production of language, pattern recognition, and various kinds of probabilistic reasoning. But potentially the most useful facility with big data would be scanning for patterns, with recognition of family-resemblance or polythetic categories, at multiple levels of abstraction and with part-whole hierarchies, with inductive prediction and the calculation of associated probabilities, with a role for context in recognition, and robust in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution. There are potential applications in several areas including, security, criminal investigations, finance, meteorology, and astronomy.",0
"We introduce FeUdal Networks (FuNs): a novel architecture for hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our approach is inspired by the feudal reinforcement learning proposal of Dayan and Hinton, and gains power and efficacy by decoupling end-to-end learning across multiple levels -- allowing it to utilise different resolutions of time. Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager operates at a lower temporal resolution and sets abstract goals which are conveyed to and enacted by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick of the environment. The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits -- in addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager. These properties allow FuN to dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on tasks that involve long-term credit assignment or memorisation. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed system on a range of tasks from the ATARI suite and also from a 3D DeepMind Lab environment.",1

A modification of the neo-fuzzy neuron is proposed (an extended neo-fuzzy neuron (ENFN)) that is characterized by improved approximating properties.

"Event Recognition systems rely on properly engineered knowledge bases of event definitions to infer occurrences of events in time. The manual development of such knowledge is a tedious and error-prone task, thus event-based applications may benefit from automated knowledge construction techniques, %developed in the field of machine learning. such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which combines machine learning with the declarative and formal semantics of First-Order Logic. However, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by logic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP systems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data are usually massive and collected at different times and under various circumstances. Ideally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an incremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of new evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order to account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past knowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of ILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that scale poorly. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and revising event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus programs. The proposed algorithm relies on abductive-inductive learning and comprises an scalable clause refinement methodology, based on a compressive summarization of clause coverage in a stream of examples. We present an empirical evaluation of our approach on real and synthetic data from a video surveillance application.",0
"We discuss the changes in an attitude to decision making at the fire ground. The changes are driven by the recent technological shift. The emerging new approaches in sensing and data processing (under common umbrella of Cyber-Physical Systems) allow for leveling off the gap, between humans and machines, in perception of the fire ground. Furthermore, results from descriptive decision theory question the rationality of human choices. This creates the need for searching and testing new approaches for decision making during emergency. We propose the framework that addresses this need. The primary feature of the framework are possibilities for incorporation of normative and prescriptive approaches to decision making. The framework also allows for comparison of the performance of decisions, between human and machine.",0
"This paper presents a knowledge-based detection of objects approach using the OWL ontology language, the Semantic Web Rule Language, and 3D processing built-ins aiming at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and specialist's knowledge. Here, we share our experience regarding the creation of 3D semantic facility model out of unorganized 3D point clouds. Thus, a knowledge-based detection approach of objects using the OWL ontology language is presented. This knowledge is used to define SWRL detection rules. In addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins in SWRL rules allows a more flexible and intelligent detection, and the annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces as output a populated ontology corresponding to an indexed scene visualized within VRML language. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system or an IFC file for architecture purposes.",0
"We consider infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. We consider the algorithm Value Iteration and the sequence of policies $\pi_1,...,\pi_k$ it gen erates until some iteration $k$. We provide performance bounds for non-stationary policies involving the last $m$ generated policies that reduce the state-of-the-art bound for the last stationary policy $\pi_k$ by a factor $\frac{1-\gamma}{1-\gamma^m}$. In other words, and contrary to a common intuition, we show that it may be much easier to find a non-stationary approximately-optimal policy than a stationary one.",0
"Measuring inconsistency is viewed as an important issue related to handling inconsistencies. Good measures are supposed to satisfy a set of rational properties. However, defining sound properties is sometimes problematic. In this paper, we emphasize one such property, named Decomposability, rarely discussed in the literature due to its modeling difficulties. To this end, we propose an independent decomposition which is more intuitive than existing proposals. To analyze inconsistency in a more fine-grained way, we introduce a graph representation of a knowledge base and various MUSdecompositions. One particular MUS-decomposition, named distributable MUS-decomposition leads to an interesting partition of inconsistencies in a knowledge base such that multiple experts can check inconsistencies in parallel, which is impossible under existing measures. Such particular MUSdecomposition results in an inconsistency measure that satisfies a number of desired properties. Moreover, we give an upper bound complexity of the measure that can be computed using 0/1 linear programming or Min Cost Satisfiability problems, and conduct preliminary experiments to show its feasibility.",0
"Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of many modern industrial and commercial tasks. An important new collection of CSPs has recently been emerging that differ from classical problems in that they impose constraints on the class of algorithms that can be used to solve them. In computer network applications, these constraints arise as the variables within the CSP are located at physically distinct devices that cannot communicate. At each instant, every variable only knows if all its constraints are met or at least one is not. Consequently, the CSP's solution must be found using a decentralized approach. Existing algorithms for solving CSPs are either centralized or distributed, both of which violate these algorithmic constraints. In this article we present the first algorithm for solving CSPs that fulfills these new requirements. It is fully decentralized, making no use of a centralized controller or message-passing between variables. We prove that this algorithm converges with probability one to a satisfying assignment whenever one exists. Surprisingly, we experimentally demonstrate that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment is competitive with both WalkSat and Survey Propagation, two popular and efficient CSP solvers. That is, despite its decentralized nature the algorithm is remarkably fast. This raises new questions about the relationship between information sharing and algorithm performance.",0
"We present a general framework for defining priors on model structure and sampling from the posterior using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The key idea is that structure priors are defined via a probability tree and that the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm operates by traversing this tree, thereby defining a cheaply computable acceptance probability. We have applied this approach to Bayesian net structure learning using a number of priors and tree traversal strategies. Our results show that these must be chosen appropriately for this approach to be successful.",0
"The underlying physiological mechanisms of generating conscious states are still unknown. To make progress on the problem of consciousness, we will need to experimentally design a system that evolves in a similar way our brains do. Recent experimental data show that the multiscale nature of the evolving human brain can be implemented by reprogramming human cells. A hybrid system can be designed to include an evolving brain equipped with digital computers that maintain homeostasis and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for the brain growth. Shaping the structure of the evolving brain will be progressively achieved by controlling spatial organization of various types of cells. Following a specific program, the evolving brain can be trained using substitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know from neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is electrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at the molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and synaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates and is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual process of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to emerge in the hybrid system.",0
"Currently, many users of Social Network Sites are insufficiently aware of who can see their shared personal items. Nonetheless, most approaches focus on enhancing privacy in Social Networks through improved privacy settings, neglecting the fact that privacy awareness is a prerequisite for privacy control. Social Network users first need to know about privacy issues before being able to make adjustments. In this paper, we introduce Friend Inspector, a serious game that allows its users to playfully increase their privacy awareness on Facebook. Since its launch, Friend Inspector has attracted a significant number of visitors, emphasising the need for better tools to understand privacy settings on Social Networks.",0
"This paper presents to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end object tracking approach which directly maps from raw sensor input to object tracks in sensor space without requiring any feature engineering or system identification in the form of plant or sensor models. Specifically, our system accepts a stream of raw sensor data at one end and, in real-time, produces an estimate of the entire environment state at the output including even occluded objects. We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data -- as commonly encountered in robotics applications -- and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise.",1
"Simple board games, like Tic-Tac-Toe and CONNECT-4, play an important role not only in the development of mathematical and logical skills, but also in the emotional and social development. In this paper, we address the problem of generating targeted starting positions for such games. This can facilitate new approaches for bringing novice players to mastery, and also leads to discovery of interesting game variants. We present an approach that generates starting states of varying hardness levels for player~$1$ in a two-player board game, given rules of the board game, the desired number of steps required for player~$1$ to win, and the expertise levels of the two players. Our approach leverages symbolic methods and iterative simulation to efficiently search the extremely large state space. We present experimental results that include discovery of states of varying hardness levels for several simple grid-based board games. The presence of such states for standard game variants like $4 \times 4$ Tic-Tac-Toe opens up new games to be played that have never been played as the default start state is heavily biased.",1
"Belief function theory provides a flexible way to combine information provided by different sources. This combination is usually followed by a decision making which can be handled by a range of decision rules. Some rules help to choose the most likely hypothesis. Others allow that a decision is made on a set of hypotheses. In [6], we proposed a decision rule based on a distance measure. First, in this paper, we aim to demonstrate that our proposed decision rule is a particular case of the rule proposed in [4]. Second, we give experiments showing that our rule is able to decide on a set of hypotheses. Some experiments are handled on a set of mass functions generated randomly, others on real databases.",0
"We consider the quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) which is to decide, given a structure and a first-order sentence (not assumed here to be in prenex form) built from conjunction and quantification, whether or not the sentence is true on the structure.

Our proof system places the established Q-resolution proof system in a broader context, and also allows us to derive QCSP tractability results.",0
"Semantic Web is actually an extension of the current one in that it represents information more meaningfully for humans and computers alike. It enables the description of contents and services in machine-readable form, and enables annotating, discovering, publishing, advertising and composing services to be automated. It was developed based on Ontology, which is considered as the backbone of the Semantic Web. In other words, the current Web is transformed from being machine-readable to machine-understandable. In fact, Ontology is a key technique with which to annotate semantics and provide a common, comprehensible foundation for resources on the Semantic Web. Moreover, Ontology can provide a common vocabulary, a grammar for publishing data, and can supply a semantic description of data which can be used to preserve the Ontologies and keep them ready for inference. This paper provides basic concepts of web services and the Semantic Web, defines the structure and the main applications of ontology, and provides many relevant terms are explained in order to provide a basic understanding of ontologies.",0
"Standard value function approaches to finding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are generally considered to be intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is to a large extent a consequence of computing an exact, optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real-world POMDP problems, computing the optimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control even for problems with complicated policy classes. The beliefs experienced by the controller often lie near a structured, low-dimensional subspace embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. Finding a good approximation to the optimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing the full value function. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space. We use Exponential family Principal Components Analysis (Collins, Dasgupta and Schapire, 2002) to represent sparse, high-dimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned features of the belief state. We then plan only in terms of the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in this low-dimensional space, we can find policies for POMDP models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks.",0
"We introduce an online neural sequence to sequence model that learns to alternate between encoding and decoding segments of the input as it is read. By independently tracking the encoding and decoding representations our algorithm permits exact polynomial marginalization of the latent segmentation during training, and during decoding beam search is employed to find the best alignment path together with the predicted output sequence. Our model tackles the bottleneck of vanilla encoder-decoders that have to read and memorize the entire input sequence in their fixed-length hidden states before producing any output. It is different from previous attentive models in that, instead of treating the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our model assigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can be marginalized out and permits online generation. Experiments on abstractive sentence summarization and morphological inflection show significant performance gains over the baseline encoder-decoders.",1
"Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Set and -Logic were defined by the author in 1995 and published for the first time in 2007. We extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is over 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is below 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component over 1 and other neutrosophic component below 0}. This is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components. For example, person working overtime deserves a membership degree over 1, while a person producing more damage than benefit to a company deserves a membership below 0.

"Massive public resume data emerging on the WWW indicates individual-related characteristics in terms of profile and career experiences. Resume Analysis (RA) provides opportunities for many applications, such as talent seeking and evaluation. Existing RA studies based on statistical analyzing have primarily focused on talent recruitment by identifying explicit attributes. However, they failed to discover the implicit semantic information, i.e., individual career progress patterns and social-relations, which are vital to comprehensive understanding of career development. Besides, how to visualize them for better human cognition is also challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a visual analytics system ResumeVis to mine and visualize resume data. Firstly, a text-mining based approach is presented to extract semantic information. Then, a set of visualizations are devised to represent the semantic information in multiple perspectives. By interactive exploration on ResumeVis performed by domain experts, the following tasks can be accomplished: to trace individual career evolving trajectory; to mine latent social-relations among individuals; and to hold the full picture of massive resumes' collective mobility. Case studies with over 2500 online officer resumes demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We provide a demonstration video.",0
"Tree projections provide a mathematical framework that encompasses all the various (purely) structural decomposition methods that have been proposed in the literature to single out classes of nearly-acyclic (hyper)graphs, such as the tree decomposition method, which is the most powerful decomposition method on graphs, and the (generalized) hypertree decomposition method, which is its natural counterpart on arbitrary hypergraphs. The paper analyzes this framework, by focusing in particular on ""minimal"" tree projections, that is, on tree projections without useless redundancies. First, it is shown that minimal tree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for normal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In particular, they enjoy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree decompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the negative answer that is provided to the open question about whether they enjoy a slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the computation of hypertree decompositions. Second, it is shown that tree projections admit a natural game-theoretic characterization in terms of the Captain and Robber game. In this game, as for the Robber and Cops game characterizing tree decompositions, the existence of winning strategies implies the existence of monotone ones. As a special case, the Captain and Robber game can be used to characterize the generalized hypertree decomposition method, where such a game-theoretic characterization was missing and asked for. Besides their theoretical interest, these results have immediate algorithmic applications both for the general setting and for structural decomposition methods that can be recast in terms of tree projections.",0
"A commonly used technique for managing AI complexity in real-time strategy (RTS) games is to use action and/or state abstractions.

"Simplifying expressions is important to make numerical integration of large expressions from High Energy Physics tractable. To this end, Horner's method can be used. Finding suitable Horner schemes is assumed to be hard, due to the lack of local heuristics. Recently, MCTS was reported to be able to find near optimal schemes. However, several parameters had to be fine-tuned manually. In this work, we investigate the state space properties of Horner schemes and find that the domain is relatively flat and contains only a few local minima. As a result, the Horner space is appropriate to be explored by Stochastic Local Search (SLS), which has only two parameters: the number of iterations (computation time) and the neighborhood structure. We found a suitable neighborhood structure, leaving only the allowed computation time as a parameter. We performed a range of experiments. The results obtained by SLS are similar or better than those obtained by MCTS. Furthermore, we show that SLS obtains the good results at least 10 times faster. Using SLS, we can speed up numerical integration of many real-world large expressions by at least a factor of 24. For High Energy Physics this means that numerical integrations that took weeks can now be done in hours.",0
"The Minimum Weight Dominating Set (MWDS) problem is an important generalization of the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem with extensive applications. This paper proposes a new local search algorithm for the MWDS problem, which is based on two new ideas. The first idea is a heuristic called two-level configuration checking (CC2), which is a new variant of a recent powerful configuration checking strategy (CC) for effectively avoiding the recent search paths. The second idea is a novel scoring function based on the frequency of being uncovered of vertices. Our algorithm is called CC2FS, according to the names of the two ideas. The experimental results show that, CC2FS performs much better than some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality on a broad range of MWDS benchmarks.",0
"Possibilistic answer set programming (PASP) extends answer set programming (ASP) by attaching to each rule a degree of certainty. While such an extension is important from an application point of view, existing semantics are not well-motivated, and do not always yield intuitive results. To develop a more suitable semantics, we first introduce a characterization of answer sets of classical ASP programs in terms of possibilistic logic where an ASP program specifies a set of constraints on possibility distributions. This characterization is then naturally generalized to define answer sets of PASP programs. We furthermore provide a syntactic counterpart, leading to a possibilistic generalization of the well-known Gelfond-Lifschitz reduct, and we show how our framework can readily be implemented using standard ASP solvers.",0
"Planning has achieved significant progress in recent years. Among the various approaches to scale up plan synthesis, the use of macro-actions has been widely explored. As a first stage towards the development of a solution to learn on-line macro-actions, we propose an algorithm to identify useful macro-actions based on data mining techniques. The integration in the planning search of these learned macro-actions shows significant improvements over four classical planning benchmarks.",0
"For large, real-world inductive learning problems, the number of training examples often must be limited due to the costs associated with procuring, preparing, and storing the training examples and/or the computational costs associated with learning from them. In such circumstances, one question of practical importance is: if only n training examples can be selected, in what proportion should the classes be represented? In this article we help to answer this question by analyzing, for a fixed training-set size, the relationship between the class distribution of the training data and the performance of classification trees induced from these data. We study twenty-six data sets and, for each, determine the best class distribution for learning. The naturally occurring class distribution is shown to generally perform well when classifier performance is evaluated using undifferentiated error rate (0/1 loss). However, when the area under the ROC curve is used to evaluate classifier performance, a balanced distribution is shown to perform well. Since neither of these choices for class distribution always generates the best-performing classifier, we introduce a budget-sensitive progressive sampling algorithm for selecting training examples based on the class associated with each example. An empirical analysis of this algorithm shows that the class distribution of the resulting training set yields classifiers with good (nearly-optimal) classification performance.",0
"To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). In this paper we propose an extension of logic programming (LP) where each default literal derived from the well-founded model is associated to a justification represented as an algebraic expression. This expression contains both causal explanations (in the form of proof graphs built with rule labels) and terms under the scope of negation that stand for conditions that enable or disable the application of causal rules. Using some examples, we discuss how these new conditions, we respectively call ""enablers"" and ""inhibitors"", are intimately related to default negation and have an essentially different nature from regular cause-effect relations. The most important result is a formal comparison to the recent algebraic approaches for justifications in LP: ""Why-not Provenance"" (WnP) and ""Causal Graphs"" (CG). We show that the current approach extends both WnP and CG justifications under the Well-Founded Semantics and, as a byproduct, we also establish a formal relation between these two approaches.",0
"Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as image classification, computers still perform poorly on cognitive tasks such as image description and question answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked ""What vehicle is the person riding?"", computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) in order to answer correctly that ""the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage"".",0
"In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for inferring the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) solution of discrete pairwise random field models under multiple constraints. We show how this constrained discrete optimization problem can be formulated as a multi-dimensional parametric mincut problem via its Lagrangian dual, and prove that our algorithm isolates all constraint instances for which the problem can be solved exactly. These multiple solutions enable us to even deal with `soft constraints' (higher order penalty functions). Moreover, we propose two practical variants of our algorithm to solve problems with hard constraints. We also show how our method can be applied to solve various constrained discrete optimization problems such as submodular minimization and shortest path computation. Experimental evaluation using the foreground-background image segmentation problem with statistic constraints reveals that our method is faster and its results are closer to the ground truth labellings compared with the popular continuous relaxation based methods.",0
"We introduce Selective Greedy Equivalence Search (SGES), a restricted version of Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). SGES retains the asymptotic correctness of GES but, unlike GES, has polynomial performance guarantees. In particular, we show that when data are sampled independently from a distribution that is perfect with respect to a DAG ${\cal G}$ defined over the observable variables then, in the limit of large data, SGES will identify ${\cal G}$'s equivalence class after a number of score evaluations that is (1) polynomial in the number of nodes and (2) exponential in various complexity measures including maximum-number-of-parents, maximum-clique-size, and a new measure called {\em v-width} that is at least as small as---and potentially much smaller than---the other two. More generally, we show that for any hereditary and equivalence-invariant property $\Pi$ known to hold in ${\cal G}$, we retain the large-sample optimality guarantees of GES even if we ignore any GES deletion operator during the backward phase that results in a state for which $\Pi$ does not hold in the common-descendants subgraph.",0
"Failure detection in telecommunication networks is a vital task. So far, several supervised and unsupervised solutions have been provided for discovering failures in such networks. Among them unsupervised approaches has attracted more attention since no label data is required. Often, network devices are not able to provide information about the type of failure. In such cases the type of failure is not known in advance and the unsupervised setting is more appropriate for diagnosis. Among unsupervised approaches, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a well-known solution which has been widely used in the anomaly detection literature and can be applied to matrix data (e.g. Users-Features). However, one of the important properties of network data is their temporal sequential nature. So considering the interaction of dimensions over a third dimension, such as time, may provide us better insights into the nature of network failures. In this paper we demonstrate the power of three-way analysis to detect events and anomalies in time-evolving network data.",0
"Ontologies provide conceptual abstractions over data, in domains such as the Internet of Things, in a way that sensor data can be harvested and interpreted by people and applications. The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is the de-facto standard for semantic representation of sensor observations and metadata, and it is used at the core of the open source platform for the Internet of Things, OpenIoT. In this paper we present a Schema Editor that provides an intuitive web interface for defining new types of sensors, and concrete instances of them, using the SSN ontology as the core model. This editor is fully integrated with the OpenIoT platform for generating virtual sensor descriptions and automating their semantic annotation and registration process.",0
"We present a modification of the superposition calculus that is meant to generate consequences of sets of first-order axioms. This approach is proven to be sound and deductive-complete in the presence of redundancy elimination rules, provided the considered consequences are built on a given finite set of ground terms, represented by constant symbols. In contrast to other approaches, most existing results about the termination of the superposition calculus can be carried over to our procedure. This ensures in particular that the calculus is terminating for many theories of interest to the SMT community.",0
"In the last decade, scenario-based serious-games have become a main tool for learning new skills and capabilities. An important factor in the development of such systems is the overhead in time, cost and human resources to manually create the content for these scenarios. We focus on how to create content for scenarios in medical, military, commerce and gaming applications where maintaining the integrity and coherence of the content is integral for the system's success. To do so, we present an automatic method for generating content about everyday activities through combining computer science techniques with the crowd. We use the crowd in three basic ways: to capture a database of scenarios of everyday activities, to generate a database of likely replacements for specific events within that scenario, and to evaluate the resulting scenarios. We found that the generated scenarios were rated as reliable and consistent by the crowd when compared to the scenarios that were originally captured. We also compared the generated scenarios to those created by traditional planning techniques. We found that both methods were equally effective in generated reliable and consistent scenarios, yet the main advantages of our approach is that the content we generate is more varied and much easier to create. We have begun integrating this approach within a scenario-based training application for novice investigators within the law enforcement departments to improve their questioning skills.",0
"We show that strategies implemented in automatic theorem proving involve an interesting tradeoff between execution speed, proving speedup/computational time and usefulness of information. We advance formal definitions for these concepts by way of a notion of normality related to an expected (optimal) theoretical speedup when adding useful information (other theorems as axioms), as compared with actual strategies that can be effectively and efficiently implemented. We propose the existence of an ineluctable tradeoff between this normality and computational time complexity. The argument quantifies the usefulness of information in terms of (positive) speed-up. The results disclose a kind of no-free-lunch scenario and a tradeoff of a fundamental nature. The main theorem in this paper together with the numerical experiment---undertaken using two different automatic theorem provers AProS and Prover9 on random theorems of propositional logic---provide strong theoretical and empirical arguments for the fact that finding new useful information for solving a specific problem (theorem) is, in general, as hard as the problem (theorem) itself.",0
"Robotic manipulation in complex open-world scenarios requires both reliable physical manipulation skills and effective and generalizable perception. In this paper, we propose a method where general purpose pretrained visual models serve as an object-centric prior for the perception system of a learned policy. We devise an object-level attentional mechanism that can be used to determine relevant objects from a few demonstrations, and then immediately incorporate those objects into a learned policy. A task-independent meta-attention locates possible objects in the scene, and a task-specific attention identifies which objects are predictive of the demonstrations. The scope of the task-specific attention is easily adjusted by showing demonstrations with distractor objects or with diverse relevant objects. Our results indicate that this approach exhibits good generalization across object instances using very few samples, and can be used to learn a variety of manipulation tasks using reinforcement learning.",0
"This Bachelor's thesis, written in Russian, is devoted to a relatively new direction in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, namely probabilistic programming. The thesis gives a brief overview to the already existing probabilistic programming languages: Church, Venture, and Anglican. It also describes the results of the first experiments on the automatic induction of probabilistic programs. The thesis was submitted, in June 2014, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The work, which is described in this thesis, has been performing in 2012-2014 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in the University of Oxford by the colleagues of the author and by himself.",0
"The paper attempts to describe the space of possible mind designs by first equating all minds to software. Next it proves some interesting properties of the mind design space such as infinitude of minds, size and representation complexity of minds. A survey of mind design taxonomies is followed by a proposal for a new field of investigation devoted to study of minds, intellectology, a list of open problems for this new field is presented.",0
"A stable joint plan should guarantee the achievement of a designer's goal in a multi-agent environment, while ensuring that deviations from the prescribed plan would be detected. We present a computational framework where stable joint plans can be studied, as well as several basic results about the representation, verification and synthesis of stable joint plans.",0
"We formulate sequence to sequence transduction as a noisy channel decoding problem and use recurrent neural networks to parameterise the source and channel models. Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-away effects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explain their inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only paired training samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal output distribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioning sequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequent symbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder. Experimental results on abstractive sentence summarisation, morphological inflection, and machine translation show that noisy channel models outperform direct models, and that they significantly benefit from increased amounts of unpaired output data that direct models cannot easily use.",1
"Question Answering System (QAS) is used for information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) to reduce human effort. There are numerous QAS based on the user documents present today, but they all are limited to providing objective answers and process simple questions only. Complex questions cannot be answered by the existing QAS, as they require interpretation of the current and old data as well as the question asked by the user. The above limitations can be overcome by using deep cases and neural network. Hence we propose a modified QAS in which we create a deep artificial neural network with associative memory from text documents. The modified QAS processes the contents of the text document provided to it and find the answer to even complex questions in the documents.",0
"Reasoning on large and complex real-world models is a computationally difficult task, yet one that is required for effective use of many AI applications. A plethora of inference algorithms have been developed that work well on specific models or only on parts of general models. Consequently, a system that can intelligently apply these inference algorithms to different parts of a model for fast reasoning is highly desirable. We introduce a new framework called structured factored inference (SFI) that provides the foundation for such a system. Using models encoded in a probabilistic programming language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into sub-models, apply an inference algorithm to each sub-model, and combine the resulting information to answer a query. Our results show that SFI is nearly as accurate as exact inference yet retains the benefits of approximate inference methods.",0
"This paper describes the best first search strategy used by U-Plan (Mansell 1993a), a planning system that constructs quantitatively ranked plans given an incomplete description of an uncertain environment. U-Plan uses uncertain and incomplete evidence de scribing the environment, characterizes it using a Dempster-Shafer interval, and generates a set of possible world states. Plan construction takes place in an abstraction hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. Search through this abstraction hierarchy is guided by a quantitative measure (expected fulfillment) based on decision theory. The search strategy is best first with the provision to update expected fulfillment and review previous decisions in the light of planning developments. U-Plan generates multiple plans for multiple possible worlds, and attempts to use existing plans for new world situations. A super-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and appropriately timed knowledge acquisition operators, which are used to decide between plan alternatives during plan execution.",0
"For an artificial creative agent, an essential driver of the search for novelty is a value function which is often provided by the system designer or users. We argue that an important barrier for progress in creativity research is the inability of these systems to develop their own notion of value for novelty. We propose a notion of knowledge-driven creativity that circumvent the need for an externally imposed value function, allowing the system to explore based on what it has learned from a set of referential objects. The concept is illustrated by a specific knowledge model provided by a deep generative autoencoder. Using the described system, we train a knowledge model on a set of digit images and we use the same model to build coherent sets of new digits that do not belong to known digit types.",0
"We propose and compare various sentence selection strategies for active learning for the task of detecting mentions of entities. The best strategy employs the sum of confidences of two statistical classifiers trained on different views of the data. Our experimental results show that, compared to the random selection strategy, this strategy reduces the amount of required labeled training data by over 50% while achieving the same performance. The effect is even more significant when only named mentions are considered: the system achieves the same performance by using only 42% of the training data required by the random selection strategy.",0
"In this paper, we present UbuntuWorld 1.0 LTS - a platform for developing automated technical support agents in the Ubuntu operating system. Specifically, we propose to use the Bash terminal as a simulator of the Ubuntu environment for a learning-based agent and demonstrate the usefulness of adopting reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for basic problem solving and troubleshooting in this environment. We provide a plug-and-play interface to the simulator as a python package where different types of agents can be plugged in and evaluated, and provide pathways for integrating data from online support forums like Ask Ubuntu into an automated agent's learning process. Finally, we show that the use of this data significantly improves the agent's learning efficiency. We believe that this platform can be adopted as a real-world test bed for research on automated technical support.",1
"In many common interactive scenarios, participants lack information about other participants, and specifically about the preferences of other participants. In this work, we model an extreme case of incomplete information, which we term games with type ambiguity, where a participant lacks even information enabling him to form a belief on the preferences of others. Under type ambiguity, one cannot analyze the scenario using the commonly used Bayesian framework, and therefore he needs to model the participants using a different decision model.",0
"Many tasks in AI require the collaboration of multiple agents. Typically, the communication protocol between agents is manually specified and not altered during training. In this paper we explore a simple neural model, called CommNN, that uses continuous communication for fully cooperative tasks. The model consists of multiple agents and the communication between them is learned alongside their policy. We apply this model to a diverse set of tasks, demonstrating the ability of the agents to learn to communicate amongst themselves, yielding improved performance over non-communicative agents and baselines. In some cases, it is possible to interpret the language devised by the agents, revealing simple but effective strategies for solving the task at hand.",1
Bellemare et al. (2016) introduced the notion of a pseudo-count to generalize count-based exploration to non-tabular reinforcement learning. This pseudo-count is derived from a density model which effectively replaces the count table used in the tabular setting. Using an exploration bonus based on this pseudo-count and a mixed Monte Carlo update applied to a DQN agent was sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 game Montezuma's Revenge.,1
"We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used for the automated annotation of music in popular on-demand streaming services. Based on the established -neuroscientifically sound- concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score to the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: i) a generic feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were ranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced perturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music. ii) a personalization stage, during which the efficiency of ex- treme learning machines (ELMs) is exploited so as to translate the derived pat- terns into a listener's score. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the system, are presented.",0
"Bayesian networks provide a method of representing conditional independence between random variables and computing the probability distributions associated with these random variables. In this paper, we extend Bayesian network structures to compute probability density functions for continuous random variables. We make this extension by approximating prior and conditional densities using sums of weighted Gaussian distributions and then finding the propagation rules for updating the densities in terms of these weights. We present a simple example that illustrates the Bayesian network for continuous variables; this example shows the effect of the network structure and approximation errors on the computation of densities for variables in the network.",0
"We study extensive form games where players might not be able to foresee the possible consequences of their actions and try to exploit the opponents' believed weaknesses in order to improve upon the final outcome. We build upon existing models of games with limited foresight, endowing players with the ability of higher-order reasoning, and proposing a novel solution concept to address intuitions coming from real game play. We analyse the resulting equilibria, devising an effective procedure to compute them.",1
"We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with succinct representations. We find that many problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. Of these, the probabilistic classes PP and NP^PP are likely to be of special interest in the field of uncertainty in artificial intelligence and are deserving of additional study. These results suggest a fruitful direction of future algorithmic development.",0
"We provide a series of algorithms demonstrating that solutions according to the fundamental game-theoretic solution concept of closed under rational behavior (CURB) sets in two-player, normal-form games can be computed in polynomial time (we also discuss extensions to n-player games). First, we describe an algorithm that identifies all of a player's best responses conditioned on the belief that the other player will play from within a given subset of its strategy space. This algorithm serves as a subroutine in a series of polynomial-time algorithms for finding all minimal CURB sets, one minimal CURB set, and the smallest minimal CURB set in a game. We then show that the complexity of finding a Nash equilibrium can be exponential only in the size of a game's smallest CURB set. Related to this, we show that the smallest CURB set can be an arbitrarily small portion of the game, but it can also be arbitrarily larger than the supports of its only enclosed Nash equilibrium. We test our algorithms empirically and find that most commonly studied academic games tend to have either very large or very small minimal CURB sets.",0
"An important challenge in constraint programming is to rewrite constraint models into executable programs calculat- ing the solutions. This phase of constraint processing may require translations between constraint programming lan- guages, transformations of constraint representations, model optimizations, and tuning of solving strategies. In this paper, we introduce a pivot metamodel describing the common fea- tures of constraint models including different kinds of con- straints, statements like conditionals and loops, and other first-class elements like object classes and predicates. This metamodel is general enough to cope with the constructions of many languages, from object-oriented modeling languages to logic languages, but it is independent from them. The rewriting operations manipulate metamodel instances apart from languages. As a consequence, the rewriting operations apply whatever languages are selected and they are able to manage model semantic information. A bridge is created between the metamodel space and languages using parsing techniques. Tools from the software engineering world can be useful to implement this framework.",0
"This paper presents incremental network quantization (INQ), a novel method, targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision convolutional neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose weights are constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike existing methods which are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization, our models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit, 3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against its 32-bit floating-point baseline. Besides, impressive results with the combination of network pruning and INQ are also reported. The code will be made publicly available.",1
"Unsupervised classification algorithm based on clonal selection principle named Unsupervised Clonal Selection Classification (UCSC) is proposed in this paper. The new proposed algorithm is data driven and self-adaptive, it adjusts its parameters to the data to make the classification operation as fast as possible. The performance of UCSC is evaluated by comparing it with the well known K-means algorithm using several artificial and real-life data sets. The experiments show that the proposed UCSC algorithm is more reliable and has high classification precision comparing to traditional classification methods such as K-means.",0
"We show that there is a general, informative and reliable procedure for discovering causal relations when, for all the investigator knows, both latent variables and selection bias may be at work. Given information about conditional independence and dependence relations between measured variables, even when latent variables and selection bias may be present, there are sufficient conditions for reliably concluding that there is a causal path from one variable to another, and sufficient conditions for reliably concluding when no such causal path exists.",0
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning has been previously shown to speed up the convergence rate of RL planning algorithms as well as mitigate feature-based model misspecification (Mankowitz et. al. 2016a,b, Bacon 2015). To do so, it utilizes hierarchical abstractions, also known as skills -- a type of temporally extended action (Sutton et. al. 1999) to plan at a higher level, abstracting away from the lower-level details. We incorporate risk sensitivity, also referred to as Situational Awareness (SA), into hierarchical RL for the first time by defining and learning risk aware skills in a Probabilistic Goal Semi-Markov Decision Process (PG-SMDP). This is achieved using our novel Situational Awareness by Risk-Conscious Skills (SARiCoS) algorithm which comes with a theoretical convergence guarantee. We show in a RoboCup soccer domain that the learned risk aware skills exhibit complex human behaviors such as `time-wasting' in a soccer game. In addition, the learned risk aware skills are able to mitigate reward-based model misspecification.",0
"The theory of actual causality, defined by Halpern and Pearl, and its quantitative measure - the degree of responsibility - was shown to be extremely useful in various areas of computer science due to a good match between the results it produces and our intuition. In this paper, I describe the applications of causality to formal verification, namely, explanation of counterexamples, refinement of coverage metrics, and symbolic trajectory evaluation. I also briefly discuss recent applications of causality to legal reasoning.",0
"Artifact systems are a novel paradigm for specifying and implementing business processes described in terms of interacting modules called artifacts. Artifacts consist of data and lifecycles, accounting respectively for the relational structure of the artifacts' states and their possible evolutions over time. In this paper we put forward artifact-centric multi-agent systems, a novel formalisation of artifact systems in the context of multi-agent systems operating on them. Differently from the usual process-based models of services, the semantics we give explicitly accounts for the data structures on which artifact systems are defined. We study the model checking problem for artifact-centric multi-agent systems against specifications written in a quantified version of temporal-epistemic logic expressing the knowledge of the agents in the exchange. We begin by noting that the problem is undecidable in general. We then identify two noteworthy restrictions, one syntactical and one semantical, that enable us to find bisimilar finite abstractions and therefore reduce the model checking problem to the instance on finite models. Under these assumptions we show that the model checking problem for these systems is EXPSPACE-complete. We then introduce artifact-centric programs, compact and declarative representations of the programs governing both the artifact system and the agents. We show that, while these in principle generate infinite-state systems, under natural conditions their verification problem can be solved on finite abstractions that can be effectively computed from the programs. Finally we exemplify the theoretical results of the paper through a mainstream procurement scenario from the artifact systems literature.",0
"Multiclass prediction is the problem of classifying an object into a relevant target class. We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sub-linearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that ShareBoost efficiently finds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the benefits of ShareBoost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches.",1
"Starting from the primary representation of neutrosophic information, namely the degree of truth, degree of indeterminacy and degree of falsity, we define a nuanced representation in a penta valued fuzzy space, described by the index of truth, index of falsity, index of ignorance, index of contradiction and index of hesitation. Also, it was constructed an associated penta valued logic and then using this logic, it was defined for the proposed penta valued structure the following operators: union, intersection, negation, complement and dual. Then, the penta valued representation is extended to a hexa valued one, adding the sixth component, namely the index of ambiguity.",0
"As datasets capturing human choices grow in richness and scale, particularly in online domains, there is an increasing need for choice models that explain and predict complex empirical choices that violate traditional choice-theoretic assumptions such as regularity, stochastic transitivity, or Luce's choice axiom. In this work we introduce a Pairwise Choice Markov Chain (PCMC) model of discrete choice that is free of all those assumptions while still satisfying the attractive foundational axiom of uniform expansion. Uniform expansion is known to imply Luce's choice axiom in the context of independent random utility models (RUMs), but the PCMC model is not a RUM (let alone an independent RUM). Inference for the PCMC model is straight-forward, and we thus introduce it as the first inferentially tractable model of discrete choice known to satisfy uniform expansion without the choice axiom, regularity, or strict stochastic transitivity. It is thus more flexible than even Tversky's Elimination By Aspects model, which assumes regularity and is also known to be inferentially intractable. We show that our model learns and predicts synthetic non-transitive data well. Our analysis also synthesizes several recent observations connecting the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model and Markov chains; the PCMC model retains the Multinomial Logit model as a special case.",1
"Fusions are a simple way of combining logics. For normal modal logics, fusions have been investigated in detail. In particular, it is known that, under certain conditions, decidability transfers from the component logics to their fusion. Though description logics are closely related to modal logics, they are not necessarily normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in description logics is not covered by the results from modal logics. In this paper, we extend the decidability transfer results from normal modal logics to a large class of description logics. To cover different description logics in a uniform way, we introduce abstract description systems, which can be seen as a common generalization of description and modal logics, and show the transfer results in this general setting.",0
"The field of Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an active area of research within Artificial Intelligence, with an increasingly important impact in industrial and other real-world applications. Within a MAS, autonomous agents interact to pursue personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) have emerged as one of the prominent agent architectures to govern the agents' autonomous behavior, where both algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure of the specific problem. During the last decade, several extensions to the DCOP model have enabled them to support MAS in complex, real-time, and uncertain environments.",0
"Efficient implementations of DPLL with the addition of clause learning are the fastest complete Boolean satisfiability solvers and can handle many significant real-world problems, such as verification, planning and design. Despite its importance, little is known of the ultimate strengths and limitations of the technique. This paper presents the first precise characterization of clause learning as a proof system (CL), and begins the task of understanding its power by relating it to the well-studied resolution proof system. In particular, we show that with a new learning scheme, CL can provide exponentially shorter proofs than many proper refinements of general resolution (RES) satisfying a natural property. These include regular and Davis-Putnam resolution, which are already known to be much stronger than ordinary DPLL. We also show that a slight variant of CL with unlimited restarts is as powerful as RES itself. Translating these analytical results to practice, however, presents a challenge because of the nondeterministic nature of clause learning algorithms. We propose a novel way of exploiting the underlying problem structure, in the form of a high level problem description such as a graph or PDDL specification, to guide clause learning algorithms toward faster solutions. We show that this leads to exponential speed-ups on grid and randomized pebbling problems, as well as substantial improvements on certain ordering formulas.",0
"Humans are sensitive to complexity and regularity in patterns. The subjective perception of pattern complexity is correlated to algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity as defined in computer science, but also to the frequency of naturally occurring patterns. However, the possible mediational role of natural frequencies in the perception of algorithmic complexity remains unclear. Here we reanalyze Hsu et al. (2010) through a mediational analysis, and complement their results in a new experiment. We conclude that human perception of complexity seems partly shaped by natural scenes statistics, thereby establishing a link between the perception of complexity and the effect of natural scene statistics.",0
"Wide-angle sonar mapping of the environment by mobile robot is nontrivial due to several sources of uncertainty: dropouts due to ""specular"" reflections, obstacle location uncertainty due to the wide beam, and distance measurement error. Earlier papers address the latter problems, but dropouts remain a problem in many environments. We present an approach that lifts the overoptimistic independence assumption used in earlier work, and use Bayes nets to represent the dependencies between objects of the model. Objects of the model consist of readings, and of regions in which ""quasi location invariance"" of the (possible) obstacles exists, with respect to the readings. Simulation supports the method's feasibility. The model is readily extensible to allow for prior distributions, as well as other types of sensing operations.",0
"We present an application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to the field of Information Security. The problem of remote Operating System (OS) Detection, also called OS Fingerprinting, is a crucial step of the penetration testing process, since the attacker (hacker or security professional) needs to know the OS of the target host in order to choose the exploits that he will use. OS Detection is accomplished by passively sniffing network packets and actively sending test packets to the target host, to study specific variations in the host responses revealing information about its operating system.",0
"Artificial intelligence develops techniques and systems whose performance must be evaluated on a regular basis in order to certify and foster progress in the discipline. We will describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We see that black-box (behavioural evaluation) is becoming more and more common, as AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable. We identify three kinds of evaluation: Human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe the limitations of the many evaluation settings and competitions in these three categories and propose several ideas for a more systematic and robust evaluation. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more general approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.",0
"Rollating walkers are popular mobility aids used by older adults to improve balance control. There is a need to automatically recognize the activities performed by walker users to better understand activity patterns, mobility issues and the context in which falls are more likely to happen. We design and compare several techniques to recognize walker related activities. A comprehensive evaluation with control subjects and walker users from a retirement community is presented.",0
"Order of magnitude reasoning - reasoning by rough comparisons of the sizes of quantities - is often called 'back of the envelope calculation', with the implication that the calculations are quick though approximate. This paper exhibits an interesting class of constraint sets in which order of magnitude reasoning is demonstrably fast. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that can solve a set of constraints of the form 'Points a and b are much closer together than points c and d.' We prove that this algorithm can be applied if `much closer together' is interpreted either as referring to an infinite difference in scale or as referring to a finite difference in scale, as long as the difference in scale is greater than the number of variables in the constraint set. We also prove that the first-order theory over such constraints is decidable.",0
The research presents epsilon hierarchical fuzzy twin support vector regression based on epsilon fuzzy twin support vector regression and epsilon twin support vector regression. Epsilon FTSVR is achieved by incorporating trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to epsilon TSVR which takes care of uncertainty existing in forecasting problems. Epsilon FTSVR determines a pair of epsilon insensitive proximal functions by solving two related quadratic programming problems. The structural risk minimization principle is implemented by introducing regularization term in primal problems of epsilon FTSVR. This yields dual stable positive definite problems which improves regression performance. Epsilon FTSVR is then reformulated as epsilon HFTSVR consisting of a set of hierarchical layers each containing epsilon FTSVR. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets reveal that epsilon HFTSVR has remarkable generalization performance with minimum training time.,0
"The selection, development, or comparison of machine learning methods in data mining can be a difficult task based on the target problem and goals of a particular study. Numerous publicly available real-world and simulated benchmark datasets have emerged from different sources, but their organization and adoption as standards have been inconsistent. As such, selecting and curating specific benchmarks remains an unnecessary burden on machine learning practitioners and data scientists. The present study introduces an accessible, curated, and developing public benchmark resource to facilitate identification of the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning methodologies. We compare meta-features among the current set of benchmark datasets in this resource to characterize the diversity of available data. Finally, we apply a number of established machine learning methods to the entire benchmark suite and analyze how datasets and algorithms cluster in terms of performance. This work is an important first step towards understanding the limitations of popular benchmarking suites and developing a resource that connects existing benchmarking standards to more diverse and efficient standards in the future.",0
"Redescription mining is a field of knowledge discovery that aims at finding different descriptions of similar subsets of instances in the data. These instances are characterized with descriptive attributes from one or more disjoint sets of attributes called views. By exploring different characterizations it is possible to find non trivial and interesting connections between different subsets of attributes. In this work, we explore the process of creating possibly large and heterogeneous redescription set in which redescriptions are iteratively improved by a conjunctive refinement procedure aimed at increasing redescription accuracy. This set is used by our redescription set construction procedure to create multiple redescription sets of user defined size. Set construction is based on redescription selection by using multi-objective optimization incorporating user defined importance levels towards one or more redescription quality criteria. These properties distinguish our approach from current state of the art approaches that create one, mostly smaller set that contains redescriptions satisfying a pre-defined set of constraints. We introduce a new redescription quality criterion that assesses the variability of redescription accuracy when missing values are present in the data. Finally, we compare the performance of our framework with three state of the art redescription mining algorithms.",0
"Optimization of Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) supports important decisions in applications such as Chemical Process Engineering. But current solvers have limited ability for deductive reasoning or the use of domain-specific theories, and the management of integrality constraints does not yet exploit automated reasoning tools such as SMT solvers. This seems to limit both scalability and reach of such tools in practice. We therefore present a tool, ManyOpt, for MINLP optimization that enables experimentation with reduction techniques which transform a MINLP problem to feasibility checking realized by an SMT solver. ManyOpt is similar to the SAT solver ManySAT in that it runs a specified number of such reduction techniques in parallel to get the strongest result on a given MINLP problem. The tool is implemented in layers, which we may see as features and where reduction techniques are feature vectors. Some of these features are inspired by known MINLP techniques whereas others are novel and specific to SMT. Our experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of this approach. The tool supports a variety of SMT solvers and is easily extensible with new features, courtesy of its layered structure. For example, logical formulas for deductive reasoning are easily added to constrain further the optimization of a MINLP problem of interest.",0
"We describe an open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (NMT). The toolkit prioritizes efficiency, modularity, and extensibility with the goal of supporting NMT research into model architectures, feature representations, and source modalities, while maintaining competitive performance and reasonable training requirements. The toolkit consists of modeling and translation support, as well as detailed pedagogical documentation about the underlying techniques.",1
"Based on the in-depth analysis of the essence and features of vague phenomena, this paper focuses on establishing the axiomatical foundation of membership degree theory for vague phenomena, presents an axiomatic system to govern membership degrees and their interconnections. On this basis, the concept of vague partition is introduced, further, the concept of fuzzy set introduced by Zadeh in 1965 is redefined based on vague partition from the perspective of axiomatization. The thesis defended in this paper is that the relationship among vague attribute values should be the starting point to recognize and model vague phenomena from a quantitative view.",0
"Open forms of global constraints allow the addition of new variables to an argument during the execution of a constraint program. Such forms are needed for difficult constraint programming problems where problem construction and problem solving are interleaved, and fit naturally within constraint logic programming. However, in general, filtering that is sound for a global constraint can be unsound when the constraint is open. This paper provides a simple characterization, called contractibility, of the constraints where filtering remains sound when the constraint is open. With this characterization we can easily determine whether a constraint has this property or not. In the latter case, we can use it to derive a contractible approximation to the constraint. We demonstrate this work on both hard and soft constraints. In the process, we formulate two general classes of soft constraints.",0
A modelling language is described which is suitable for the correlation of information when the underlying functional model of the system is incomplete or uncertain and the temporal dependencies are imprecise. An efficient and incremental implementation is outlined which depends on cost functions satisfying certain criteria. Possibilistic logic and probability theory (as it is used in the applications targetted) satisfy these criteria.,0
"Information-theoretic principles for learning and acting have been proposed to solve particular classes of Markov Decision Problems. Mathematically, such approaches are governed by a variational free energy principle and allow solving MDP planning problems with information-processing constraints expressed in terms of a Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a reference distribution. Here we consider a generalization of such MDP planners by taking model uncertainty into account. As model uncertainty can also be formalized as an information-processing constraint, we can derive a unified solution from a single generalized variational principle. We provide a generalized value iteration scheme together with a convergence proof. As limit cases, this generalized scheme includes standard value iteration with a known model, Bayesian MDP planning, and robust planning. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in a grid world simulation.",0
"Conversion optimization means designing a web interface so that as many users as possible take a desired action on it, such as register or purchase. Such design is usually done by hand, testing one change at a time through A/B testing, or a limited number of combinations through multivariate testing, making it possible to evaluate only a small fraction of designs in a vast design space. This paper describes Sentient Ascend, an automatic conversion optimization system that uses evolutionary optimization to create effective web interface designs. Ascend makes it possible to discover and utilize interactions between the design elements that are difficult to identify otherwise. Moreover, evaluation of design candidates is done in parallel online, i.e. with a large number of real users interacting with the system. A case study on a lead generation site learnhotobecome.org shows that significant improvements (i.e. over 43%) are possible beyond human design. Ascend can therefore be seen as an approach to massively multivariate conversion optimization, based on a massively parallel interactive evolution.",0
"This article presents the state-of-the-art in optimal solution methods for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs), which are general models for collaborative multiagent planning under uncertainty. Building off the generalized multiagent A* (GMAA*) algorithm, which reduces the problem to a tree of one-shot collaborative Bayesian games (CBGs), we describe several advances that greatly expand the range of Dec-POMDPs that can be solved optimally. First, we introduce lossless incremental clustering of the CBGs solved by GMAA*, which achieves exponential speedups without sacrificing optimality. Second, we introduce incremental expansion of nodes in the GMAA* search tree, which avoids the need to expand all children, the number of which is in the worst case doubly exponential in the nodes depth. This is particularly beneficial when little clustering is possible. In addition, we introduce new hybrid heuristic representations that are more compact and thereby enable the solution of larger Dec-POMDPs. We provide theoretical guarantees that, when a suitable heuristic is used, both incremental clustering and incremental expansion yield algorithms that are both complete and search equivalent. Finally, we present extensive empirical results demonstrating that GMAA*-ICE, an algorithm that synthesizes these advances, can optimally solve Dec-POMDPs of unprecedented size.",0
"The paper provides a survey of semantic methods for solution of fundamental tasks in mathematical knowledge management. Ontological models and formalisms are discussed. We propose an ontology of mathematical knowledge, covering wide range of fields of mathematics. We demonstrate applications of this representation in mathematical formula search, and learning.",0
"How can we deploy a high-accuracy system starting with zero training examples? We consider an ""on-the-job"" setting, where as inputs arrive, we use crowdsourcing to resolve uncertainty where needed and output our prediction when confident. As the model improves over time, the reliance on crowdsourcing queries decreases. We cast our setting as a stochastic game based on Bayesian decision theory, which allows us to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. Computing the optimal policy is intractable, so we develop an approximation based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. We tested our approach across three datasets---named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification. On the NER task we obtained a 6--7 fold reduction in cost compared to full human annotation. We also achieve a 17% F$_1$ improvement over having a single human label the whole set, and a 28% F$_1$ improvement over online learning.",1
"In this paper we present an approach to extract ordered timelines of events, their participants, locations and times from a set of multilingual and cross-lingual data sources. Based on the assumption that event-related information can be recovered from different documents written in different languages, we extend the Cross-document Event Ordering task presented at SemEval 2015 by specifying two new tasks for, respectively, Multilingual and Cross-lingual Timeline Extraction. We then develop three deterministic algorithms for timeline extraction based on two main ideas. First, we address implicit temporal relations at document level since explicit time-anchors are too scarce to build a wide coverage timeline extraction system. Second, we leverage several multilingual resources to obtain a single, inter-operable, semantic representation of events across documents and across languages. The result is a highly competitive system that strongly outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Nonetheless, further analysis of the results reveals that linking the event mentions with their target entities and time-anchors remains a difficult challenge. The systems, resources and scorers are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.",0
"In this paper, we use evidence-specific value abstraction for speeding Bayesian networks inference. This is done by grouping variable values and treating the combined values as a single entity. As we show, such abstractions can exploit regularities in conditional probability distributions and also the specific values of observed variables. To formally justify value abstraction, we define the notion of safe value abstraction and devise inference algorithms that use it to reduce the cost of inference. Our procedure is particularly useful for learning complex networks with many hidden variables. In such cases, repeated likelihood computations are required for EM or other parameter optimization techniques. Since these computations are repeated with respect to the same evidence set, our methods can provide significant speedup to the learning procedure. We demonstrate the algorithm on genetic linkage problems where the use of value abstraction sometimes differentiates between a feasible and non-feasible solution.",0
"CAPTCHAs or reverse Turing tests are real-time assessments used by programs (or computers) to tell humans and machines apart. This is achieved by assigning and assessing hard AI problems that could only be solved easily by human but not by machines. Applications of such assessments range from stopping spammers from automatically filling online forms to preventing hackers from performing dictionary attack. Today, the race between makers and breakers of CAPTCHAs is at a juncture, where the CAPTCHAs proposed are not even answerable by humans. We consider such CAPTCHAs as non user friendly. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for reverse Turing test - we call it the Line CAPTCHAs - that mainly focuses on user friendliness while not compromising the security aspect that is expected to be provided by such a system.",0
"Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computation have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced -- that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper and Walker2d) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary.",1
"This paper explores algorithms for processing probabilistic and deterministic information when the former is represented as a belief network and the latter as a set of boolean clauses. The motivating tasks are 1. evaluating beliefs networks having a large number of deterministic relationships and2. evaluating probabilities of complex boolean querie over a belief network. We propose a parameterized family of variable elimination algorithms that exploit both types of information, and that allows varying levels of constraint propagation inferences. The complexity of the scheme is controlled by the induced-width of the graph {em augmented} by the dependencies introduced by the boolean constraints. Preliminary empirical evaluation demonstrate the effect of constraint propagation on probabilistic computation.",0
"Research on developing efficient and scalable ASP solvers can substantially benefit by the availability of data sets to experiment with. KB_Bio_101 contains knowledge from a biology textbook, has been developed as part of Project Halo, and has recently become available for research use. KB_Bio_101 is one of the largest KBs available in ASP and the reasoning with it is undecidable in general. We give a description of this KB and ASP programs for a suite of queries that have been of practical interest. We explain why these queries pose significant practical challenges for the current ASP solvers.",0
"Quality assurance remains a key topic in human computation research. Prior work indicates that majority voting is effective for low difficulty tasks, but has limitations for harder tasks. This paper explores two methods of addressing this problem: tournament selection and elimination selection, which exploit 2-, 3- and 4-way comparisons between different answers to human computation tasks. Our experimental results and statistical analyses show that both methods produce the correct answer in noisy human computation environment more often than majority voting. Furthermore, we find that the use of 4-way comparisons can significantly reduce the cost of quality assurance relative to the use of 2-way comparisons.",0
"We propose a formalism for representation of finite languages, referred to as the class of IDL-expressions, which combines concepts that were only considered in isolation in existing formalisms. The suggested applications are in natural language processing, more specifically in surface natural language generation and in machine translation, where a sentence is obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented in a compact way, and then by filtering such a set through a parser. We study several formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard ones. We also present a novel parsing algorithm for IDL-expressions and prove a non-trivial upper bound on its time complexity.",0
"Transfer and multi-task learning have traditionally focused on either a single source-target pair or very few, similar tasks. Ideally, the linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and semantics would benefit each other by being trained in a single model. We introduce such a joint many-task model together with a strategy for successively growing its depth to solve increasingly complex tasks. All layers include shortcut connections to both word representations and lower-level task predictions. We use a simple regularization term to allow for optimizing all model weights to improve one task's loss without exhibiting catastrophic interference of the other tasks. Our single end-to-end trainable model obtains state-of-the-art results on chunking, dependency parsing, semantic relatedness and textual entailment. It also performs competitively on POS tagging. Our dependency parsing layer relies only on a single feed-forward pass and does not require a beam search.",1
"RDF and Description Logics work in an open-world setting where absence of information is not information about absence. Nevertheless, Description Logic axioms can be interpreted in a closed-world setting and in this setting they can be used for both constraint checking and closed-world recognition against information sources. When the information sources are expressed in well-behaved RDF or RDFS (i.e., RDF graphs interpreted in the RDF or RDFS semantics) this constraint checking and closed-world recognition is simple to describe. Further this constraint checking can be implemented as SPARQL querying and thus effectively performed.",1
"One of the most useful sensitivity analysis techniques of decision analysis is the computation of value of information (or clairvoyance), the difference in value obtained by changing the decisions by which some of the uncertainties are observed. In this paper, some simple but powerful extensions to previous algorithms are introduced which allow an efficient value of information calculation on the rooted cluster tree (or strong junction tree) used to solve the original decision problem.",0
"Effective teams are crucial for organisations, especially in environments that require teams to be constantly created and dismantled, such as software development, scientific experiments, crowd-sourcing, or the classroom. Key factors influencing team performance are competences and personality of team members. Hence, we present a computational model to compose proficient and congenial teams based on individuals' personalities and their competences to perform tasks of different nature. With this purpose, we extend Wilde's post-Jungian method for team composition, which solely employs individuals' personalities. The aim of this study is to create a model to partition agents into teams that are balanced in competences, personality and gender. Finally, we present some preliminary empirical results that we obtained when analysing student performance. Results show the benefits of a more informed team composition that exploits individuals' competences besides information about their personalities.",0
"Representation determines how we can reason about a specific problem. Sometimes one representation helps us find a proof more easily than others. Most current automated reasoning tools focus on reasoning within one representation. There is, therefore, a need for the development of better tools to mechanise and automate formal and logically sound changes of representation.",0
"The advance of Internet and Sensor technology has brought about new challenges evoked by the emergence of continuous data streams. Beyond rapid data processing, application areas like ambient assisted living, robotics, or dynamic scheduling involve complex reasoning tasks. We address such scenarios and elaborate upon approaches to knowledge-intense stream reasoning, based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). While traditional ASP methods are devised for singular problem solving, we develop new techniques to formulate and process problems dealing with emerging as well as expiring data in a seamless way.",0
"Analogy-Based (or Analogical) and Case-Based Reasoning (ABR and CBR) are two similar problem solving processes based on the adaptation of the solution of past problems for use with a new analogous problem. In this paper we review these two processes and we give some real world examples with emphasis to the field of Medicine, where one can find some of the most common and useful CBR applications. We also underline the differences between CBR and the classical rule-induction algorithms, we discuss the criticism for CBR methods and we focus on the future trends of research in the area of CBR.",0
"Explaining and reasoning about processes which underlie observed black-box phenomena enables the discovery of causal mechanisms, derivation of suitable abstract representations and the formulation of more robust predictions. We propose to learn high level functional programs in order to represent abstract models which capture the invariant structure in the observed data. We introduce the $\pi$-machine (program-induction machine) -- an architecture able to induce interpretable LISP-like programs from observed data traces. We propose an optimisation procedure for program learning based on backpropagation, gradient descent and A* search. We apply the proposed method to three problems: system identification of dynamical systems, explaining the behaviour of a DQN agent and learning by demonstration in a human-robot interaction scenario. Our experimental results show that the $\pi$-machine can efficiently induce interpretable programs from individual data traces.",0
"Two major goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions to complex problems. In this paper, we argue that complexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals. We demonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures. NEAT is applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head. Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification. When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed structure, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies. The results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize.",0
"This paper describes a class of probabilistic approximation algorithms based on bucket elimination which offer adjustable levels of accuracy and efficiency. We analyze the approximation for several tasks: finding the most probable explanation, belief updating and finding the maximum a posteriori hypothesis. We identify regions of completeness and provide preliminary empirical evaluation on randomly generated networks.",0
"[Background]: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has become an important software engineering research method but costs tremendous efforts. [Aim]: This paper proposes an approach to leverage on empirically evolved ontology to support automating key SLR activities. [Method]: First, we propose an ontology, SLRONT, built on SLR experiences and best practices as a groundwork to capture common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes; second, we present an extended version of SLRONT, the COSONT and instantiate it with the knowledge and concepts extracted from structured abstracts. Case studies illustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps. [Results]: Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared with sheer manual works, but the efforts involved is significantly reduced. [Conclusions]: The approach of using ontology could effectively and efficiently support the conducting of systematic literature review.",0
"The population in Sweden is growing rapidly due to immigration. In this light, the issue of infrastructure upgrades to provide telecommunication services is of importance. New antennas can be installed at hot spots of user demand, which will require an investment, and/or the clientele expansion can be carried out in a planned manner to promote the exploitation of the infrastructure in the less loaded geographical zones. In this paper, we explore the second alternative. Informally speaking, the term Infrastructure-Stressing describes a user who stays in the zones of high demand, which are prone to produce service failures, if further loaded. We have studied the Infrastructure-Stressing population in the light of their correlation with geo-demographic segments. This is motivated by the fact that specific geo-demographic segments can be targeted via marketing campaigns. Fuzzy logic is applied to create an interface between big data, numeric methods for processing big data and a manager.",0

Verbs and noun phrases are annotated with event and participant types, respectively. Additionally, the text is annotated with coreference information. The corpus shows rich lexical variation and will serve as a unique resource for the study of the role of script knowledge in natural language processing.",0
"Bayesian networks provide a modeling language and associated inference algorithm for stochastic domains. They have been successfully applied in a variety of medium-scale applications. However, when faced with a large complex domain, the task of modeling using Bayesian networks begins to resemble the task of programming using logical circuits. In this paper, we describe an object-oriented Bayesian network (OOBN) language, which allows complex domains to be described in terms of inter-related objects. We use a Bayesian network fragment to describe the probabilistic relations between the attributes of an object. These attributes can themselves be objects, providing a natural framework for encoding part-of hierarchies. Classes are used to provide a reusable probabilistic model which can be applied to multiple similar objects. Classes also support inheritance of model fragments from a class to a subclass, allowing the common aspects of related classes to be defined only once. Our language has clear declarative semantics: an OOBN can be interpreted as a stochastic functional program, so that it uniquely specifies a probabilistic model. We provide an inference algorithm for OOBNs, and show that much of the structural information encoded by an OOBN--particularly the encapsulation of variables within an object and the reuse of model fragments in different contexts--can also be used to speed up the inference process.",0
"We introduce a new dynamic model with the capability of recognizing both activities that an individual is performing as well as where that ndividual is located. Our model is novel in that it utilizes a dynamic graphical model to jointly estimate both activity and spatial context over time based on the simultaneous use of asynchronous observations consisting of GPS measurements, and measurements from a small mountable sensor board. Joint inference is quite desirable as it has the ability to improve accuracy of the model. A key goal, however, in designing our overall system is to be able to perform accurate inference decisions while minimizing the amount of hardware an individual must wear. This minimization leads to greater comfort and flexibility, decreased power requirements and therefore increased battery life, and reduced cost. We show results indicating that our joint measurement model outperforms measurements from either the sensor board or GPS alone, using two types of probabilistic inference procedures, namely particle filtering and pruned exact inference.",0
"Stable Logic Programming (SLP) is an emergent, alternative style of logic programming: each solution to a problem is represented by a stable model of a deductive database/function-free logic program encoding the problem itself. Several implementations now exist for stable logic programming, and their performance is rapidly improving. To make SLP generally applicable, it should be possible to check for consistency (i.e., existence of stable models) of the input program before attempting to answer queries. In the literature, only rather strong sufficient conditions have been proposed for consistency, e.g., stratification. This paper extends these results in several directions. First, the syntactic features of programs, viz. cyclic negative dependencies, affecting the existence of stable models are characterized, and their relevance is discussed. Next, a new graph representation of logic programs, the Extended Dependency Graph (EDG), is introduced, which conveys enough information for reasoning about stable models (while the traditional Dependency Graph does not). Finally, we show that the problem of the existence of stable models can be reformulated in terms of coloring of the EDG.",0
"In 2008, the CEO of the company that manages and maintains the public bicycle service in Barcelona 1 recognized that one may not expect to always find a place to leave the rented bike nearby their destination, similarly to the case when, driving a car, people may not find a parking lot 2 . In this work, we make predictions about the statuses of the stations of the public bicycle service in Barcelona. We show that it is feasible to correctly predict nearly half of the times when the stations are either completely full of bikes or completely empty, up to 2 days before they actually happen. That is, users might avoid stations at times when they could not return a bicycle that they have rented before, or when they would not find a bike to rent. To achieve that, we apply the Random Forest algorithm to classify the status of the stations and improve the lifetime of the models using publicly available data, such as information about the weather forecast. Finally, we expect that the results of the predictions can be used to improve the quality of the service and make it more reliable for the users.",0
"Graph aggregation is the process of computing a single output graph that constitutes a good compromise between several input graphs, each provided by a different source. One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders), when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given dataset (graphs as equivalence relations). In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used. The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that generalises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to a large collection of different types of graphs.",0
"In this paper we introduce a class of Markov decision processes that arise as a natural model for many renewable resource allocation problems. Upon extending results from the inventory control literature, we prove that they admit a closed form solution and we show how to exploit this structure to speed up its computation. We consider the application of the proposed framework to several problems arising in very different domains, and as part of the ongoing effort in the emerging field of Computational Sustainability we discuss in detail its application to the Northern Pacific Halibut marine fishery. Our approach is applied to a model based on real world data, obtaining a policy with a guaranteed lower bound on the utility function that is structurally very different from the one currently employed.",0
"This thesis describes work on two applications of probabilistic programming: the learning of probabilistic program code given specifications, in particular program code of one-dimensional samplers; and the facilitation of sequential Monte Carlo inference with help of data-driven proposals. The latter is presented with experimental results on a linear Gaussian model and a non-parametric dependent Dirichlet process mixture of objects model for object recognition and tracking.",0
"The analysis of the current integration attempts of some modes and use cases of user-machine interaction is presented. The new concept of the user-driven intelligent interface is proposed on the basis of multimodal augmented reality and brain-computer interaction for various applications: in disabilities studies, education, home care, health care, etc. The several use cases of multimodal augmentation are presented. The perspectives of the better human comprehension by the immediate feedback through neurophysical channels by means of brain-computer interaction are outlined. It is shown that brain-computer interface (BCI) technology provides new strategies to overcome limits of the currently available user interfaces, especially for people with functional disabilities. The results of the previous studies of the low end consumer and open-source BCI-devices allow us to conclude that combination of machine learning (ML), multimodal interactions (visual, sound, tactile) with BCI will profit from the immediate feedback from the actual neurophysical reactions classified by ML methods. In general, BCI in combination with other modes of AR interaction can deliver much more information than these types of interaction themselves. Even in the current state the combined AR-BCI interfaces could provide the highly adaptable and personal services, especially for people with functional disabilities.",0
"CP-nets and their variants constitute one of the main AI approaches for specifying and reasoning about preferences. CI-nets, in particular, are a CP-inspired formalism for representing ordinal preferences over sets of goods, which are typically required to be monotonic.",0
"The use of preferences in query answering, both in traditional databases and in ontology-based data access, has recently received much attention, due to its many real-world applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of top-k query answering in Datalog+/- ontologies subject to the querying user's preferences and a collection of (subjective) reports of other users. Here, each report consists of scores for a list of features, its author's preferences among the features, as well as other information. Theses pieces of information of every report are then combined, along with the querying user's preferences and his/her trust into each report, to rank the query results. We present two alternative such rankings, along with algorithms for top-k (atomic) query answering under these rankings. We also show that, under suitable assumptions, these algorithms run in polynomial time in the data complexity. We finally present more general reports, which are associated with sets of atoms rather than single atoms.",0
"For many optimization problems it is possible to define a distance metric between problem variables that correlates with the likelihood and strength of interactions between the variables. For example, one may define a metric so that the dependencies between variables that are closer to each other with respect to the metric are expected to be stronger than the dependencies between variables that are further apart. The purpose of this paper is to describe a method that combines such a problem-specific distance metric with information mined from probabilistic models obtained in previous runs of estimation of distribution algorithms with the goal of solving future problem instances of similar type with increased speed, accuracy and reliability. While the focus of the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm, it should be straightforward to generalize the approach to other model-directed optimization techniques and other problem classes. Compared to other techniques for learning from experience put forward in the past, the proposed technique is both more practical and more broadly applicable.",0
"Bounded policy iteration is an approach to solving infinite-horizon POMDPs that represents policies as stochastic finite-state controllers and iteratively improves a controller by adjusting the parameters of each node using linear programming. In the original algorithm, the size of the linear programs, and thus the complexity of policy improvement, depends on the number of parameters of each node, which grows with the size of the controller. But in practice, the number of parameters of a node with non-zero values is often very small, and does not grow with the size of the controller. Based on this observation, we develop a version of bounded policy iteration that leverages the sparse structure of a stochastic finite-state controller. In each iteration, it improves a policy by the same amount as the original algorithm, but with much better scalability.",0
"The adaptation to situations of sequential choice under uncertainty of decision criteria which deviate from (subjective) expected utility raises the problem of ensuring the selection of a nondominated strategy. In particular, when following the suggestion of Machina and McClennen of giving up separability (also known as consequentialism), which requires the choice of a substrategy in a subtree to depend only on data relevant to that subtree, one must renounce to the use of dynamic programming, since Bellman's principle is no longer valid. An interpretation of McClennen's resolute choice, based on cooperation between the successive Selves of the decision maker, is proposed. Implementations of resolute choice which prevent Money Pumps negative prices of information or, more generally, choices of dominated strategies, while remaining computationally tractable, are proposed.",0
"We consider the Bayesian active learning and experimental design problem, where the goal is to learn the value of some unknown target variable through a sequence of informative, noisy tests. In contrast to prior work, we focus on the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly. In this paper, we propose ECED, a novel, computationally efficient active learning algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated, noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective, which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the near-optimal bound. We demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances, including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among economic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preference learning task via pairwise comparisons.",0
"Sophisticated gated recurrent neural network architectures like LSTMs and GRUs have been shown to be highly effective in a myriad of applications. We develop an un-gated unit, the statistical recurrent unit (SRU), that is able to learn long term dependencies in data by only keeping moving averages of statistics. The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in various tasks. We show the efficacy of SRUs as compared to LSTMs and GRUs in an unbiased manner by optimizing respective architectures' hyperparameters in a Bayesian optimization scheme for both synthetic and real-world tasks.",1
"In this paper we dealt with the comparison and linking between lexical resources with domain knowledge provided by ontologies. It is one of the issues for the combination of the Semantic Web Ontologies and Text Mining. We investigated the relations between the linguistics oriented and domain-specific semantics, by associating the GO biological process concepts to the FrameNet semantic frames. The result shows the gaps between the linguistics-oriented and domain-specific semantics on the classification of events and the grouping of target words. The result provides valuable information for the improvement of domain ontologies supporting for text mining systems. And also, it will result in benefits to language understanding technology.",0
"In this paper, we present a preliminary work on an approach to fill the gap between logic-based argumentation and the numerous approaches to tackle the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks. Our idea is that, even when arguments and attacks are defined by means of a logical belief base, there may be some uncertainty about how accurate is the content of an argument, and so the presence (or absence) of attacks concerning it. We use enthymemes to illustrate this notion of uncertainty of arguments and attacks. Indeed, as argued in the literature, real arguments are often enthymemes instead of completely specified deductive arguments. This means that some parts of the pair (support, claim) may be missing because they are supposed to belong to some ""common knowledge"", and then should be deduced by the agent which receives the enthymeme. But the perception that agents have of the common knowledge may be wrong, and then a first agent may state an enthymeme that her opponent is not able to decode in an accurate way. It is likely that the decoding of the enthymeme by the agent leads to mistaken attacks between this new argument and the existing ones. In this case, the agent can receive some information about attacks or arguments acceptance statuses which disagree with her argumentation framework. We exemplify a way to incorporate this new piece of information by means of existing works on the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks.",0
"Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have been introduced very successfully into human activity recognition (HAR) scenarios in ubiquitous and wearable computing. Especially the prospect of overcoming the need for manual feature design combined with superior classification capabilities render deep neural networks very attractive for real-life HAR application. Even though DL-based approaches now outperform the state-of-the-art in a number of recognitions tasks of the field, yet substantial challenges remain. Most prominently, issues with real-life datasets, typically including imbalanced datasets and problematic data quality, still limit the effectiveness of activity recognition using wearables. In this paper we tackle such challenges through Ensembles of deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We have developed modified training procedures for LSTM networks and combine sets of diverse LSTM learners into classifier collectives. We demonstrate, both formally and empirically, that Ensembles of deep LSTM learners outperform the individual LSTM networks. Through an extensive experimental evaluation on three standard benchmarks (Opportunity, PAMAP2, Skoda) we demonstrate the excellent recognition capabilities of our approach and its potential for real-life applications of human activity recognition.",0
"This book-length article combines several peer reviewed papers and new material to analyze the issues of ethical artificial intelligence (AI). The behavior of future AI systems can be described by mathematical equations, which are adapted to analyze possible unintended AI behaviors and ways that AI designs can avoid them. This article also discusses how future AI will differ from current AI, the politics of AI, and the ultimate use of AI to help understand the nature of the universe and our place in it.",0
"For high level path planning, environments are usually modeled as distance graphs, and path planning problems are reduced to computing the shortest path in distance graphs. One major drawback of this modeling is the inability to model uncertainties, which are often encountered in practice. In this paper, a new tool, called U-yraph, is proposed for environment modeling. A U-graph is an extension of distance graphs with the ability to handle a kind of uncertainty. By modeling an uncertain environment as a U-graph, and a navigation problem as a Markovian decision process, we can precisely define a new optimality criterion for navigation plans, and more importantly, we can come up with a general algorithm for computing optimal plans for navigation tasks.",0
"Teaching machines to read natural language documents remains an elusive challenge. Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions posed on the contents of documents that they have seen, but until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. In this work we define a new methodology that resolves this bottleneck and provides large scale supervised reading comprehension data. This allows us to develop a class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with minimal prior knowledge of language structure.",1
"We propose a new directed graphical representation of utility functions, called UCP-networks, that combines aspects of two existing graphical models: generalized additive models and CP-networks. The network decomposes a utility function into a number of additive factors, with the directionality of the arcs reflecting conditional dependence of preference statements - in the underlying (qualitative) preference ordering - under a {em ceteris paribus} (all else being equal) interpretation. This representation is arguably natural in many settings. Furthermore, the strong CP-semantics ensures that computation of optimization and dominance queries is very efficient. We also demonstrate the value of this representation in decision making. Finally, we describe an interactive elicitation procedure that takes advantage of the linear nature of the constraints on ""`tradeoff weights"" imposed by a UCP-network. This procedure allows the network to be refined until the regret of the decision with minimax regret (with respect to the incompletely specified utility function) falls below a specified threshold (e.g., the cost of further questioning.",0
"We introduce a diversified top-k partial MaxSAT problem, a combination of partial MaxSAT problem and enumeration problem. Given a partial MaxSAT formula F and a positive integer k, the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT is to find k maximal solutions for F such that the k maximal solutions satisfy the maximum number of soft clauses of F. This problem can be widely used in many applications including community detection, sensor place, motif discovery, and combinatorial testing. We prove the problem is NP-hard and propose an approach for solving the problem. The concrete idea of the approach is to design an encoding EE which reduces diversified top-k partial MaxSAT problem into partial MaxSAT problem, and then solve the resulting problem with state-of-art solvers. In addition, we present an algorithm MEMKC exactly solving the diversified top-k partial MaxSAT. Through several experiments we show that our approach can be successfully applied to the interesting problem.",0
"Reasoning with ontologies is one of the core fields of research in Description Logics. A variety of efficient reasoner with highly optimized algorithms have been developed to allow inference tasks on expressive ontology languages such as OWL(DL). However, reasoner reported computing times have exceeded and sometimes fall behind the expected theoretical values. From an empirical perspective, it is not yet well understood, which particular aspects in the ontology are reasoner performance degrading factors. In this paper, we conducted an investigation about state of art works that attempted to portray potential correlation between reasoner empirical behaviour and particular ontological features. These works were analysed and then broken down into categories. Further, we proposed a set of ontology features covering a broad range of structural and syntactic ontology characteristics. We claim that these features are good indicators of the ontology hardness level against reasoning tasks.",0
"The National Airspace System (NAS) is a large and complex system with thousands of interrelated components: administration, control centers, airports, airlines, aircraft, passengers, etc. The complexity of the NAS creates many difficulties in management and control. One of the most pressing problems is flight delay. Delay creates high cost to airlines, complaints from passengers, and difficulties for airport operations. As demand on the system increases, the delay problem becomes more and more prominent. For this reason, it is essential for the Federal Aviation Administration to understand the causes of delay and to find ways to reduce delay. Major contributing factors to delay are congestion at the origin airport, weather, increasing demand, and air traffic management (ATM) decisions such as the Ground Delay Programs (GDP). Delay is an inherently stochastic phenomenon. Even if all known causal factors could be accounted for, macro-level national airspace system (NAS) delays could not be predicted with certainty from micro-level aircraft information. This paper presents a stochastic model that uses Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model the relationships among different components of aircraft delay and the causal factors that affect delays. A case study on delays of departure flights from Chicago O'Hare international airport (ORD) to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) reveals how local and system level environmental and human-caused factors combine to affect components of delay, and how these components contribute to the final arrival delay at the destination airport.",0
"The emerging need for qualitative approaches in context-aware information processing calls for proper modeling of context information and efficient handling of its inherent uncertainty resulted from human interpretation and usage. Many of the current approaches to context-awareness either lack a solid theoretical basis for modeling or ignore important requirements such as modularity, high-order uncertainty management and group-based context-awareness. Therefore, their real-world application and extendability remains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based context-awareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory for modeling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of context which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between members of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer architecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with words (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed using a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that the proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness by offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a service-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware, group-based and platform-independent access to information systems.",0
"An objective of this work is to contextualize the analysis of large and multi-faceted data sources. Consider for example, health research in the context of social characteristics. Also there may be social research in the context of health characteristics. Related to this can be requirements for contextualizing Big Data analytics. A major challenge in Big Data analytics is the bias due to self selection. In general, and in practical settings, the aim is to determine the most revealing coupling of mainstream data and context. This is technically processed in Correspondence Analysis through use of the main and the supplementary data elements, i.e., individuals or objects, attributes and modalities.",0
"A neutrosophic set is a more general platform, which can be used to present uncertainty, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent. In this paper a score function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative. Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s) according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.",0
"Content marketing is todays one of the most remarkable approaches in the context of marketing processes of companies. Value of this kind of marketing has improved in time, thanks to the latest developments regarding to computer and communication technologies. Nowadays, especially social media based platforms have a great importance on enabling companies to design multimedia oriented, interactive content. But on the other hand, there is still something more to do for improved content marketing approaches. In this context, objective of this study is to focus on intelligent content marketing, which can be done by using artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is todays one of the most remarkable research fields and it can be used easily as multidisciplinary. So, this study has aimed to discuss about its potential on improving content marketing. In detail, the study has enabled readers to improve their awareness about the intersection point of content marketing and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the authors have introduced some example models of intelligent content marketing, which can be achieved by using current Web technologies and artificial intelligence techniques.",0
"We show in this paper how managed multi-context systems (mMCSs) can be turned into a reactive formalism suitable for continuous reasoning in dynamic environments. We extend mMCSs with (abstract) sensors and define the notion of a run of the extended systems. We then show how typical problems arising in online reasoning can be addressed: handling potentially inconsistent sensor input, modeling intelligent forms of forgetting, selective integration of knowledge, and controlling the reasoning effort spent by contexts, like setting contexts to an idle mode. We also investigate the complexity of some important related decision problems and discuss different design choices which are given to the knowledge engineer.",0
"Abstraction is a fundamental tool for reasoning about complex systems. Program abstraction has been utilized to great effect for analyzing deterministic programs. At the heart of pro- gram abstraction is the relationship between a concrete program, which is difficult to analyze, and an abstraction, which is more tractable. We generalize non-deterministic program abstractions to probabilistic program abstractions by explicitly quantifying the non-deterministic choices made by traditional program abstractions. We upgrade key theoretical program abstraction insights to the probabilistic context. Probabilistic program abstractions provide avenues for utilizing abstraction techniques from the programming languages community to improve the analysis of probabilistic programs.",0
"Recently, there has been a renewed interest in decomposition-based approaches for evolutionary multiobjective optimization. However, the impact of the choice of the underlying scalarizing function(s) is still far from being well understood. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of different scalarizing functions and their parameters. We thereby abstract firstly from any specific algorithm and only consider the difficulty of the single scalarized problems in terms of the search ability of a (1+lambda)-EA on biobjective NK-landscapes. Secondly, combining the outcomes of independent single-objective runs allows for more general statements on set-based performance measures. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the opening angle of the scalarizing function's underlying contour lines and the position of the final solution in the objective space. Our analysis is of fundamental nature and sheds more light on the key characteristics of multiobjective scalarizing functions.",0
"Median clustering is of great value for partitioning relational data. In this paper, a new prototype-based clustering method, called Median Evidential C-Means (MECM), which is an extension of median c-means and median fuzzy c-means on the theoretical framework of belief functions is proposed. The median variant relaxes the restriction of a metric space embedding for the objects but constrains the prototypes to be in the original data set. Due to these properties, MECM could be applied to graph clustering problems. A community detection scheme for social networks based on MECM is investigated and the obtained credal partitions of graphs, which are more refined than crisp and fuzzy ones, enable us to have a better understanding of the graph structures. An initial prototype-selection scheme based on evidential semi-centrality is presented to avoid local premature convergence and an evidential modularity function is defined to choose the optimal number of communities. Finally, experiments in synthetic and real data sets illustrate the performance of MECM and show its difference to other methods.",0
"Relation detection is a core component for many NLP applications including Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). In this paper, we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network enhanced by residual learning that detects KB relations given an input question. Our method uses deep residual bidirectional LSTMs to compare questions and relation names via different hierarchies of abstraction. Additionally, we propose a simple KBQA system that integrates entity linking and our proposed relation detector to enable one enhance another. Experimental results evidence that our approach achieves not only outstanding relation detection performance, but more importantly, it helps our KBQA system to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks.",1
"Lifted inference algorithms exploit symmetries in probabilistic models to speed up inference. They show impressive performance when calculating unconditional probabilities in relational models, but often resort to non-lifted inference when computing conditional probabilities. The reason is that conditioning on evidence breaks many of the model's symmetries, which can preempt standard lifting techniques. Recent theoretical results show, for example, that conditioning on evidence which corresponds to binary relations is #P-hard, suggesting that no lifting is to be expected in the worst case. In this paper, we balance this negative result by identifying the Boolean rank of the evidence as a key parameter for characterizing the complexity of conditioning in lifted inference. In particular, we show that conditioning on binary evidence with bounded Boolean rank is efficient. This opens up the possibility of approximating evidence by a low-rank Boolean matrix factorization, which we investigate both theoretically and empirically.",1
"Philosophers writing about the ravens paradox often note that Nicod's Condition (NC) holds given some set of background information, and fails to hold against others, but rarely go any further. That is, it is usually not explored which background information makes NC true or false. The present paper aims to fill this gap. For us, ""(objective) background knowledge"" is restricted to information that can be expressed as probability events. Any other configuration is regarded as being subjective and a property of the a priori probability distribution. We study NC in two specific settings. In the first case, a complete description of some individuals is known, e.g. one knows of each of a group of individuals whether they are black and whether they are ravens. In the second case, the number of individuals having a particular property is given, e.g. one knows how many ravens or how many black things there are (in the relevant population). While some of the most famous answers to the paradox are measure-dependent, our discussion is not restricted to any particular probability measure. Our most interesting result is that in the second setting, NC violates a simple kind of inductive inference (namely projectability). Since relative to NC, this latter rule is more closely related to, and more directly justified by our intuitive notion of inductive reasoning, this tension makes a case against the plausibility of NC. In the end, we suggest that the informal representation of NC may seem to be intuitively plausible because it can easily be mistaken for reasoning by analogy.",0
"This paper introduces a new computing model based on the cooperation among Turing machines called orchestrated machines. Like universal Turing machines, orchestrated machines are also designed to simulate Turing machines but they can also modify the original operation of the included Turing machines to create a new layer of some kind of collective behavior. Using this new model we can define some interested notions related to cooperation ability of Turing machines such as the intelligence quotient or the emotional intelligence quotient for Turing machines.",0
"We investigate properties of ABA+, a formalism that extends the well studied structured argumentation formalism Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with a preference handling mechanism. In particular, we establish desirable properties that ABA+ semantics exhibit. These pave way to the satisfaction by ABA+ of some (arguably) desirable principles of preference handling in argumentation and non-monotonic reasoning, as well as non-monotonic inference properties of ABA+ under various semantics.",0
"AI planning algorithms have addressed the problem of generating sequences of operators that achieve some input goal, usually assuming that the planning agent has perfect control over and information about the world. Relaxing these assumptions requires an extension to the action representation that allows reasoning both about the changes an action makes and the information it provides. This paper presents an action representation that extends the deterministic STRIPS model, allowing actions to have both causal and informational effects, both of which can be context dependent and noisy. We also demonstrate how a standard least-commitment planning algorithm can be extended to include informational actions and contingent execution.",0
"We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and a group of agents (e.g., passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items. Our goal is to pick a set of $K$ items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick $K$ movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among available ones (in the movie example, the perceived value of a movie depends on the values of the other ones available). Extreme examples of our model include the setting where each agent derives utility from his or her most preferred item only (e.g., an agent will watch his or her favorite movie only), from his or her least preferred item only (e.g., the agent worries that he or she will be somehow forced to watch the worst available movie), or derives $1/K$ of the utility from each of the available items (e.g., the agent will pick a movie at random). Formally, to model this process of adjusting the derived utility, we use the mechanism of ordered weighted average (OWA) operators. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where particular OWA operators are applicable. Second, we show that, in general, our problem is NP-hard but---depending on the OWA operator and the nature of agents' utilities---there exist good, efficient approximation algorithms (sometimes even polynomial time approximation schemes). Interestingly, our results generalize and build upon those for proportional represented in multiwinner voting scenarios.",1
"Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the most effective approach to causal discovery, but in many circumstances it is impossible to conduct RCTs. Therefore observational studies based on passively observed data are widely accepted as an alternative to RCTs. However, in observational studies, prior knowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect relationships to be tested, hence they can only be applied to problems with available domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many data sets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the opportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In another direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to identify associations among variables in large data sets. The problem is, causal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true. However we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically, association rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality problem while observational studies can be utilised to eliminate non-causal associations. In this paper we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and develop an algorithm for mining CRs in large data sets. We use the idea of retrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association rule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with the commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach in general is faster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible causes. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables, a feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess.",0
"The efficiency of inference in both the Hugin and, most notably, the Shafer-Shenoy architectures can be improved by exploiting the independence relations induced by the incoming messages of a clique. That is, the message to be sent from a clique can be computed via a factorization of the clique potential in the form of a junction tree. In this paper we show that by exploiting such nested junction trees in the computation of messages both space and time costs of the conventional propagation methods may be reduced. The paper presents a structured way of exploiting the nested junction trees technique to achieve such reductions. The usefulness of the method is emphasized through a thorough empirical evaluation involving ten large real-world Bayesian networks and the Hugin inference algorithm.",0
"Interaction information is one of the multivariate generalizations of mutual information, which expresses the amount information shared among a set of variables, beyond the information, which is shared in any proper subset of those variables. Unlike (conditional) mutual information, which is always non-negative, interaction information can be negative. We utilize this property to find the direction of causal influences among variables in a triangle topology under some mild assumptions.",0
"Several studies on sentence processing suggest that the mental lexicon keeps track of the mutual expectations between words. Current DSMs, however, represent context words as separate features, which causes the loss of important information for word expectations, such as word order and interrelations. In this paper, we present a DSM which addresses the issue by defining verb contexts as joint dependencies. We test our representation in a verb similarity task on two datasets, showing that joint contexts are more efficient than single dependencies, even with a relatively small amount of training data.",1
"We propose a new approach to value function approximation which combines linear temporal difference reinforcement learning with subspace identification. In practical applications, reinforcement learning (RL) is complicated by the fact that state is either high-dimensional or partially observable. Therefore, RL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state itself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the suitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification (SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much information as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two approaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set of features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function approximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called Predictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive state representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a large set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of predictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to estimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior approaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent, perform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its potential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.",1
"Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Existing classification methods are designed to classify unknown instances within a set of previously known classes that are seen in training. Such classification takes the form of prediction within a closed-set. However, a more realistic scenario that fits the ground truth of real world applications is to consider the possibility of encountering instances that do not belong to any of the classes that are seen in training, $i.e.$, an open-set classification. In such situation, existing closed-set classification methods will assign a training label to these instances resulting in a misclassification. In this paper, we introduce Galaxy-X, a novel multi-class classification method for open-set problem. For each class of the training set, Galaxy-X creates a minimum bounding hyper-sphere that encompasses the distribution of the class by enclosing all of its instances. In such manner, our method is able to distinguish instances resembling previously seen classes from those that are of unseen classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the efficiency of our approach in classifying novel instances from known as well as unknown classes. We also introduce a novel evaluation procedure to adequately evaluate open-set classification.",0
"This paper describes about information extraction system, which is an extension of the system developed by team Hitachi for ""Disease/Disorder Template filling"" task organized by ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evolution Lab 2014. In this extension module we focus on extraction of numerical attributes and values from discharge summary records and associating correct relation between attributes and values. We solve the problem in two steps. First step is extraction of numerical attributes and values, which is developed as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using Stanford NLP libraries. Second step is correctly associating the attributes to values, which is developed as a relation extraction module in Apache cTAKES framework. We integrated Stanford NER model as cTAKES pipeline component and used in relation extraction module. Conditional Random Field (CRF) algorithm is used for NER and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for relation extraction. For attribute value relation extraction, we observe 95% accuracy using NER alone and combined accuracy of 87% with NER and SVM.",0
"Considering the high heterogeneity of the ontologies pub-lished on the web, ontology matching is a crucial issue whose aim is to establish links between an entity of a source ontology and one or several entities from a target ontology. Perfectible similarity measures, consid-ered as sources of information, are combined to establish these links. The theory of belief functions is a powerful mathematical tool for combining such uncertain information. In this paper, we introduce a decision pro-cess based on a distance measure to identify the best possible matching entities for a given source entity.",0
"This paper presents an approach to identify efficient techniques used in Web Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Understanding SEO factors which can influence page ranking in search engine is significant for webmasters who wish to attract large number of users to their website. Different from previous relevant research, in this study we developed an intelligent Meta search engine which aggregates results from various search engines and ranks them based on several important SEO parameters. The research tries to establish that using more SEO parameters in ranking algorithms helps in retrieving better search results thus increasing user satisfaction. Initial results generated from Meta search engine outperformed existing search engines in terms of better retrieved search results with high precision.",0
"In the interpretation of experimental data, one is actually looking for plausible explanations. We look for a measure of plausibility, with which we can compare different possible explanations, and which can be combined when there are different sets of data. This is contrasted to the conventional measure for probabilities as well as to the proposed measure of possibilities. We define what characteristics this measure of plausibility should have.",0
"We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgenstein's language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing how to quickly learn a semantic parsing model from scratch, and that modeling pragmatics further accelerates learning for successful players.",1
"We consider a voting setting where candidates have preferences about the outcome of the election and are free to join or leave the election. The corresponding candidacy game, where candidates choose strategically to participate or not, has been studied in very few papers, mainly by Dutta et al., who showed that no non-dictatorial voting procedure satisfying unanimity is candidacy-strategyproof, or equivalently, is such that the joint action where all candidates enter the election is always a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. They also showed that for voting trees, there are candidacy games with no pure strategy equilibria. However, no results were known about other voting rules. Here we prove several such results. Some are positive (a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed for Copeland and the uncovered set, whichever the number of candidates, and for all Condorcet-consistent rules, for 4 candidates). Some are negative, namely for plurality and maximin. We also study the existence of strong equilibria and relate it to a stronger variant of candidate control.",0
"Probabilistic sampling methods have become very popular to solve single-shot path planning problems. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in particular have been shown to be very efficient in solving high dimensional problems. Even though several RRT variants have been proposed to tackle the dynamic replanning problem, these methods only perform well in environments with infrequent changes. This paper addresses the dynamic path planning problem by combining simple techniques in a multi-stage probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm uses RRTs as an initial solution, informed local search to fix unfeasible paths and a simple greedy optimizer. The algorithm is capable of recognizing when the local search is stuck, and subsequently restart the RRT. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to a highly dynamic environment than the dynamic RRT variants.",0
"Inference in graphical models consists of repeatedly multiplying and summing out potentials. It is generally intractable because the derived potentials obtained in this way can be exponentially large. Approximate inference techniques such as belief propagation and variational methods combat this by simplifying the derived potentials, typically by dropping variables from them. We propose an alternate method for simplifying potentials: quantizing their values. Quantization causes different states of a potential to have the same value, and therefore introduces context-specific independencies that can be exploited to represent the potential more compactly. We use algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to do this efficiently. We apply quantization and ADD reduction to variable elimination and junction tree propagation, yielding a family of bounded approximate inference schemes. Our experimental tests show that our new schemes significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on many benchmark instances.",0
"Object recognition is an important task in image processing and computer vision. This paper presents a perfect method for object recognition with full boundary detection by combining affine scale invariant feature transform (ASIFT) and a region merging algorithm. ASIFT is a fully affine invariant algorithm that means features are invariant to six affine parameters namely translation (2 parameters), zoom, rotation and two camera axis orientations. The features are very reliable and give us strong keypoints that can be used for matching between different images of an object. We trained an object in several images with different aspects for finding best keypoints of it. Then, a robust region merging algorithm is used to recognize and detect the object with full boundary in the other images based on ASIFT keypoints and a similarity measure for merging regions in the image. Experimental results show that the presented method is very efficient and powerful to recognize the object and detect it with high accuracy.",0
"Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with the aim of extracting insights related to dynamic behavior. Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions. Finding the right event labels to enable the application of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing). Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have been shown to enable discovery of more precise and insightful process models. However, there exists no automated approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process mining. In this paper we propose a framework for the automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events, allowing us to distinguish behaviourally different instances of the same event type based on their time attribute. We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that using automatically generated refined labels in process discovery, we can find more specific, and therefore more insightful, process models. We observe that one label refinement could have an effect on the usefulness of other label refinements when used together. Therefore, we explore four strategies to generate useful combinations of multiple label refinements and evaluate those on three real life smart home event logs.",0
"We propose Coactive Learning as a model of interaction between a learning system and a human user, where both have the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user. At each step, the system (e.g. search engine) receives a context (e.g. query) and predicts an object (e.g. ranking). The user responds by correcting the system if necessary, providing a slightly improved -- but not necessarily optimal -- object as feedback. We argue that such feedback can often be inferred from observable user behavior, for example, from clicks in web-search. Evaluating predictions by their cardinal utility to the user, we propose efficient learning algorithms that have ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ average regret, even though the learning algorithm never observes cardinal utility values as in conventional online learning. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and learning algorithms on a movie recommendation task, as well as ranking for web-search.",1
"This paper proposes a decision support system to aid movie investment decisions at the early stage of movie productions. The system predicts the success of a movie based on its profitability by leveraging historical data from various sources. Using social network analysis and text mining techniques, the system automatically extracts several groups of features, including ""who"" are on the cast, ""what"" a movie is about, ""when"" a movie will be released, as well as ""hybrid"" features that match ""who"" with ""what"", and ""when"" with ""what"". Our experiments with movies during an 11-year period showcase the system's decent performance in predicting movie success. Moreover, experiment results also suggest that different groups of features, including novel features we proposed, all contribute to the prediction.",0
"The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW) is an extension of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which takes into account the dynamic nature of the problem. This aspect requires the vehicle routes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new customer requests arrive in the system and must be incorporated into an evolving schedule during the working day. Besides the vehicle capacity constraint involved in the classical VRP, DVRPTW considers in addition time windows, which are able to better capture real-world situations. Despite this, so far, few studies have focused on tackling this problem of greater practical importance. To this end, this study devises for the resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based algorithm, which resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to construct in parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local search procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and with an insertion heuristics, which tries to reduce the number of vehicles used to service the available customers. The experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective, and on DVRPTW instances with a higher dynamicity level, it is able to yield better results compared to existing ant-based approaches.",0
"This paper is concerned with the apparent greatest weakness of the Mathematical Theory of Evidence (MTE) of Shafer \cite{Shafer:76}, which has been strongly criticized by Wasserman \cite{Wasserman:92ijar} - the relationship to frequencies.",0
"Uncertainty of decisions in safety-critical engineering applications can be estimated on the basis of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of averaging over decision models. The use of decision tree (DT) models assists experts to interpret causal relations and find factors of the uncertainty. Bayesian averaging also allows experts to estimate the uncertainty accurately when a priori information on the favored structure of DTs is available. Then an expert can select a single DT model, typically the Maximum a Posteriori model, for interpretation purposes. Unfortunately, a priori information on favored structure of DTs is not always available. For this reason, we suggest a new prior on DTs for the Bayesian MCMC technique. We also suggest a new procedure of selecting a single DT and describe an application scenario. In our experiments on the Short-Term Conflict Alert data our technique outperforms the existing Bayesian techniques in predictive accuracy of the selected single DTs.",0
"We propose a decomposition of the max-min fair curriculum-based course time-tabling (MMF-CB-CTT) problem. The decomposition models the room assignment subproblem as a generalized lexicographic bottleneck optimization problem (GLBOP). We show that the GLBOP can be solved in polynomial time if the corresponding sum optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time as well. Thus, the room assignment subproblem of the MMF-CB-CTT problem can be solved efficiently. We apply this result to a previously proposed heuristic algorithm for the MMF-CB-CTT problem, in which solving the room assignment subproblem is a key ingredient. Our experimental results indicate that using the proposed decomposition improves the performance of the algorithm on most of the 21 ITC2007 test instances with respect to the quality of the best solution found and the average solution quality. Furthermore, we introduce a measure for the quality of a solution to a (generalized) lexicographic bottleneck optimization problem. This measure helps to overcome some limitations imposed by the qualitative nature of max-min fairness and aids the statistical evaluation of the performance of randomized algorithms for such problems.",0
"In the domain of the Soccer simulation 2D league of the RoboCup project, appropriate player positioning against a given opponent team is an important factor of soccer team performance. This work proposes a model which decides the strategy that should be applied regarding a particular opponent team. This task can be realized by applying preliminary a learning phase where the model determines the most effective strategies against clusters of opponent teams. The model determines the best strategies by using sequential Bayes' estimators. As a first trial of the system, the proposed model is used to determine the association of player formations against opponent teams in the particular situation of corner-kick. The implemented model shows satisfying abilities to compare player formations that are similar to each other in terms of performance and determines the right ranking even by running a decent number of simulation games.",0
"A core challenge for an agent learning to interact with the world is to predict how its actions affect objects in its environment. Many existing methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled object information. However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we develop an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant to object appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce a dataset of 50,000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a ""visual imagination"" of different futures based on different courses of action. Our experiments show that our proposed method not only produces more accurate video predictions, but also more accurately predicts object motion, when compared to prior methods.",1
"This paper investigates the application of consensus clustering and meta-clustering to the set of all possible partitions of a data set.

"Remote science operations require automated systems that can both act and react with minimal human intervention. One such vision is that of an intelligent instrument that collects data in an automated fashion, and based on what it learns, decides which new measurements to take. This innovation implements experimental design and unites it with data analysis in such a way that it completes the cycle of learning. This cycle is the basis of the Scientific Method.",0
"Over the past few years, online aggression and abusive behaviors have occurred in many different forms and on a variety of platforms. In extreme cases, these incidents have evolved into hate, discrimination, and bullying, and even materialized into real-world threats and attacks against individuals or groups. In this paper, we study the Gamergate controversy. Started in August 2014 in the online gaming world, it quickly spread across various social networking platforms, ultimately leading to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression. We focus on Twitter, presenting a measurement study of a dataset of 340k unique users and 1.6M tweets to study the properties of these users, the content they post, and how they differ from random Twitter users. We find that users involved in this ""Twitter war"" tend to have more friends and followers, are generally more engaged and post tweets with negative sentiment, less joy, and more hate than random users. We also perform preliminary measurements on how the Twitter suspension mechanism deals with such abusive behaviors. While we focus on Gamergate, our methodology to collect and analyze tweets related to aggressive and bullying activities is of independent interest.",0
"Feature selection refers to the problem of selecting relevant features which produce the most predictive outcome. In particular, feature selection task is involved in datasets containing huge number of features. Rough set theory has been one of the most successful methods used for feature selection. However, this method is still not able to find optimal subsets. This paper proposes a new feature selection method based on Rough set theory hybrid with Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) in an attempt to combat this. This proposed work is applied in the medical domain to find the minimal reducts and experimentally compared with the Quick Reduct, Entropy Based Reduct, and other hybrid Rough Set methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).",0
We propose a validity preserving translation from a subset of epistemic Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) to epistemic Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The considered subset of epistemic ATL is known to have the finite model property and decidable model-checking. This entails the decidability of validity but the implied algorithm is unfeasible. Reducing the validity problem to that in a corresponding system of CTL makes the techniques for automated deduction for that logic available for the handling of the apparently more complex system of ATL.,0
"Landing an unmanned aerial vehicle on a ground marker is an open problem despite the effort of the research community. Previous attempts mostly focused on the analysis of hand-crafted geometric features and the use of external sensors in order to allow the vehicle to approach the land-pad. In this article, we propose a method based on deep reinforcement learning which only requires low-resolution images taken from a down-looking camera in order to identify the position of the marker and land the quadrotor on it. The proposed approach is based on a hierarchy of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) which are used as high-level control policy for the navigation toward the marker. We implemented different technical solutions, such as the combination of vanilla and double DQNs trained using a form of prioritized buffer replay which separates experiences in multiple containers. Learning is achieved without any human supervision, giving to the agent an high-level feedback. The results show that the quadrotor can autonomously accomplish landing on a large variety of simulated environments and with relevant noise. In some conditions the DQN outperformed human pilots tested in the same environment.",0
"In this paper, we present the Difference- Based Causality Learner (DBCL), an algorithm for learning a class of discrete-time dynamic models that represents all causation across time by means of difference equations driving change in a system. We motivate this representation with real-world mechanical systems and prove DBCL's correctness for learning structure from time series data, an endeavour that is complicated by the existence of latent derivatives that have to be detected. We also prove that, under common assumptions for causal discovery, DBCL will identify the presence or absence of feedback loops, making the model more useful for predicting the effects of manipulating variables when the system is in equilibrium. We argue analytically and show empirically the advantages of DBCL over vector autoregression (VAR) and Granger causality models as well as modified forms of Bayesian and constraintbased structure discovery algorithms. Finally, we show that our algorithm can discover causal directions of alpha rhythms in human brains from EEG data.",0
"In this paper we propose the creation of generic LSH families for the angular distance based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss projections. We show that feature hashing is a valid J-L projection and propose two new LSH families based on feature hashing. These new LSH families are tested on both synthetic and real datasets with very good results and a considerable performance improvement over other LSH families. While the theoretical analysis is done for the angular distance, these families can also be used in practice for the euclidean distance with excellent results [2]. Our tests using real datasets show that the proposed LSH functions work well for the euclidean distance.",0
"Recent progress in Reinforcement Learning (RL), fueled by its combination, with Deep Learning has enabled impressive results in learning to interact with complex virtual environments, yet real-world applications of RL are still scarce. A key limitation is data efficiency, with current state-of-the-art approaches requiring millions of training samples. A promising way to tackle this problem is to augment RL with learning from human demonstrations. However, human demonstration data is not yet readily available. This hinders progress in this direction. The present work addresses this problem as follows. We (i) collect and describe a large dataset of human Atari 2600 replays -- the largest and most diverse such data set publicly released to date, (ii) illustrate an example use of this dataset by analyzing the relation between demonstration quality and imitation learning performance, and (iii) outline possible research directions that are opened up by our work.",0
"Predictive models deployed in the world may assign incorrect labels to instances with high confidence. Such errors or unknown unknowns are rooted in model incompleteness, and typically arise because of the mismatch between training data and the cases seen in the open world. As the models are blind to such errors, input from an oracle is needed to identify these failures. In this paper, we formulate and address the problem of optimizing the discovery of unknown unknowns of any predictive model under a fixed budget, which limits the number of times an oracle can be queried for true labels. We propose a model-agnostic methodology which uses feedback from an oracle to both identify unknown unknowns and to intelligently guide the discovery. We employ a two-phase approach which first organizes the data into multiple partitions based on instance similarity, and then utilizes an explore-exploit strategy for discovering unknown unknowns across these partitions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by varying the underlying causes of unknown unknowns across various applications. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first algorithmic approach to the problem of discovering unknown unknowns of predictive models.",1
"In educational technology and learning sciences, there are multiple uses for a predictive model of whether a student will perform a task correctly or not. For example, an intelligent tutoring system may use such a model to estimate whether or not a student has mastered a skill. We analyze the significance of data recency in making such predictions, i.e., asking whether relatively more recent observations of a student's performance matter more than relatively older observations. We develop a new Recent-Performance Factors Analysis model that takes data recency into account. The new model significantly improves predictive accuracy over both existing logistic-regression performance models and over novel baseline models in evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets. As a secondary contribution, we demonstrate how the widely used cross-validation with 0-1 loss is inferior to AIC and to cross-validation with L1 prediction error loss as a measure of model performance.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of merging uncertain information in the framework of possibilistic logic. It presents several syntactic combination rules to merge possibilistic knowledge bases, provided by different sources, into a new possibilistic knowledge base. These combination rules are first described at the meta-level outside the language of possibilistic logic. Next, an extension of possibilistic logic, where the combination rules are inside the language, is proposed. A proof system in a sequent form, which is sound and complete with respect to the possibilistic logic semantics, is given.",0
The ideas about decision making under ignorance in economics are combined with the ideas about uncertainty representation in computer science. The combination sheds new light on the question of how artificial agents can act in a dynamically consistent manner. The notion of sequential consistency is formalized by adapting the law of iterated expectation for plausibility measures. The necessary and sufficient condition for a certainty equivalence operator for Nehring-Puppe's preference to be sequentially consistent is given. This result sheds light on the models of decision making under uncertainty.,0
"Artifact-centric models for business processes recently raised a lot of attention as they manage to combine structural (i.e. data related) with dynamical (i.e. process related) aspects in a seamless way. This developed in parallel with declarative approaches for modelling processes, where activities are not burdened by over-specified constrains like in traditional process-centric approaches, but try to adapt the internal system to the humans involved and the input they receive. In this paper, we try to merge these two aspects by proposing a framework aimed at describing rich business domains through Description Logic-based ontologies, and where a set of actions allows the system to evolve by modifying such ontologies. We then propose an evolution of such framework which represents a viable and formal environment to develop decision making and planning techniques for DL-based artifact-centric business domains.",0

"This paper presents a new classifier combination technique based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a powerful method for combining measures of evidence from different classifiers. However, since each of the available methods that estimates the evidence of classifiers has its own limitations, we propose here a new implementation which adapts to training data so that the overall mean square error is minimized. The proposed technique is shown to outperform most available classifier combination methods when tested on three different classification problems.",0
"This paper presents HEALER, a software agent that recommends sequential intervention plans for use by homeless shelters, who organize these interventions to raise awareness about HIV among homeless youth. HEALER's sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is currently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.",0
"First-order model counting emerged recently as a novel reasoning task, at the core of efficient algorithms for probabilistic logics. We present a Skolemization algorithm for model counting problems that eliminates existential quantifiers from a first-order logic theory without changing its weighted model count. For certain subsets of first-order logic, lifted model counters were shown to run in time polynomial in the number of objects in the domain of discourse, where propositional model counters require exponential time. However, these guarantees apply only to Skolem normal form theories (i.e., no existential quantifiers) as the presence of existential quantifiers reduces lifted model counters to propositional ones. Since textbook Skolemization is not sound for model counting, these restrictions precluded efficient model counting for directed models, such as probabilistic logic programs, which rely on existential quantification. Our Skolemization procedure extends the applicability of first-order model counters to these representations. Moreover, it simplifies the design of lifted model counting algorithms.",0
"We examine the meaning and the complexity of probabilistic logic programs that consist of a set of rules and a set of independent probabilistic facts (that is, programs based on Sato's distribution semantics). We focus on two semantics, respectively based on stable and on well-founded models. We show that the semantics based on stable models (referred to as the ""credal semantics"") produces sets of probability models that dominate infinitely monotone Choquet capacities, we describe several useful consequences of this result. We then examine the complexity of inference with probabilistic logic programs. We distinguish between the complexity of inference when a probabilistic program and a query are given (the inferential complexity), and the complexity of inference when the probabilistic program is fixed and the query is given (the query complexity, akin to data complexity as used in database theory). We obtain results on the inferential and query complexity for acyclic, stratified, and cyclic propositional and relational programs, complexity reaches various levels of the counting hierarchy and even exponential levels.",0
"This publication presents a relation computation or calculus for international relations using a mathematical modeling. It examined trust for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.",0
"Current metropolises largely depend on a functioning transport infrastructure and the increasing demand can only be satisfied by a well organized mass transit. One example for a crucial mass transit system is New York City's Staten Island Ferry, connecting the two boroughs of Staten Island and Manhattan with a regular passenger service. Today's demand already exceeds 2500 passengers for a single cycle during peek hours, and future projections suggest that it will further increase. One way to appraise how the system will cope with future demand is by simulation. This contribution proposes an integrated simulation approach to evaluate the system performance with respect to future demand. The simulation relies on a multiscale modeling approach where the terminal buildings are simulated by a microscopic and quantitatively valid cellular automata (CA) and the journeys of the ferries themselves are modeled by a mesoscopic queue simulation approach. Based on the simulation results recommendations with respect to the future demand are given.",0
"In this work we present a new reinforcement learning agent, called Reactor (for Retrace-actor), based on an off-policy multi-step return actor-critic architecture. The agent uses a deep recurrent neural network for function approximation. The network outputs a target policy {\pi} (the actor), an action-value Q-function (the critic) evaluating the current policy {\pi}, and an estimated behavioral policy {\hat \mu} which we use for off-policy correction. The agent maintains a memory buffer filled with past experiences. The critic is trained by the multi-step off-policy Retrace algorithm and the actor is trained by a novel {\beta}-leave-one-out policy gradient estimate (which uses both the off-policy corrected return and the estimated Q-function). The Reactor is sample-efficient thanks to the use of memory replay, and numerical efficient since it uses multi-step returns. Also both acting and learning can be parallelized. We evaluated our algorithm on 57 Atari 2600 games and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.",0
"In this article, we present a survey of recent advances in passive human behaviour recognition in indoor areas using the channel state information (CSI) of commercial WiFi systems. Movement of human body causes a change in the wireless signal reflections, which results in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behaviour can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performances, however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and show the improved performance. We also discuss about different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and multi-user scenario, and suggest possible directions for future work.",0
"Testing the validity of probabilistic models containing unmeasured (hidden) variables is shown to be a hard task. We show that the task of testing whether models are structurally incompatible with the data at hand, requires an exponential number of independence evaluations, each of the form: ""X is conditionally independent of Y, given Z."" In contrast, a linear number of such evaluations is required to test a standard Bayesian network (one per vertex). On the positive side, we show that if a network with hidden variables G has a tree skeleton, checking whether G represents a given probability model P requires the polynomial number of such independence evaluations. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs a tree-structured Bayesian network (with hidden variables) that represents P if such a network exists, and further recognizes when such a network does not exist.",0
"Symmetry breaking has been proven to be an efficient preprocessing technique for satisfiability solving (SAT). In this paper, we port the state-of-the-art SAT symmetry breaker BreakID to answer set programming (ASP). The result is a lightweight tool that can be plugged in between the grounding and the solving phases that are common when modelling in ASP. We compare our tool with sbass, the current state-of-the-art symmetry breaker for ASP.",0
"Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. However, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointing decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.",1
A new probabilistic methodology for transmission expansion planning (TEP) that does not require a priori specification of new/additional transmission capacities and uses the concept of social welfare has been proposed. Two new concepts have been introduced in this paper: (i) roulette wheel methodology has been used to calculate the capacity of new transmission lines and (ii) load flow analysis has been used to calculate expected demand not served (EDNS). The overall methodology has been implemented on a modified IEEE 5-bus test system. Simulations show an important result: addition of only new transmission lines is not sufficient to minimize EDNS.,0
"Interactive partially observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDP) provide a formal framework for planning for a self-interested agent in multiagent settings. An agent operating in a multiagent environment must deliberate about the actions that other agents may take and the effect these actions have on the environment and the rewards it receives. Traditional I-POMDPs model this dependence on the actions of other agents using joint action and model spaces. Therefore, the solution complexity grows exponentially with the number of agents thereby complicating scalability. In this paper, we model and extend anonymity and context-specific independence -- problem structures often present in agent populations -- for computational gain. We empirically demonstrate the efficiency from exploiting these problem structures by solving a new multiagent problem involving more than 1,000 agents.",0
"Online sequence prediction is the problem of predicting the next element of a sequence given previous elements. This problem has been extensively studied in the context of individual sequence prediction, where no prior assumptions are made on the origin of the sequence. Individual sequence prediction algorithms work quite well for long sequences, where the algorithm has enough time to learn the temporal structure of the sequence. However, they might give poor predictions for short sequences. A possible remedy is to rely on the general model of prediction with expert advice, where the learner has access to a set of $r$ experts, each of which makes its own predictions on the sequence. It is well known that it is possible to predict almost as well as the best expert if the sequence length is order of $\log(r)$. But, without firm prior knowledge on the problem, it is not clear how to choose a small set of {\em good} experts. In this paper we describe and analyze a new algorithm that learns a good set of experts using a training set of previously observed sequences. We demonstrate the merits of our approach by applying it on the task of click prediction on the web.",1
"Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&amp;C) server. In order to block DGA C&amp;C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results.",0
"Traditionally, researchers in decision making have focused on attempting to reach Pareto Optimality using horizontal approaches, where optimality is calculated taking into account every participant at the same time. Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.). In this paper, we explore the possibility of achieving Pareto Optimal outcomes in a group by using a bottom-up approach: discovering Pareto optimal outcomes by interacting in subgroups. We analytically show that Pareto optimal outcomes in a subgroup are also Pareto optimal in a supergroup of those agents in the case of strict, transitive, and complete preferences. Then, we empirically analyze the prospective usability and practicality of bottom-up approaches in a variety of decision making domains.",0
"In this work we focus on efficient heuristics for solving a class of stochastic planning problems that arise in a variety of business, investment, and industrial applications. The problem is best described in terms of future buy and sell contracts. By buying less reliable, but less expensive, buy (supply) contracts, a company or a trader can cover a position of more reliable and more expensive sell contracts. The goal is to maximize the expected net gain (profit) by constructing a dose to optimum portfolio out of the available buy and sell contracts. This stochastic planning problem can be formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear programming problem with recourse. However, this formalization leads to solutions that are exponential in the number of possible failure combinations. Thus, this approach is not feasible for large scale problems. In this work we investigate heuristic approximation techniques alleviating the efficiency problem. We primarily focus on the clustering approach and devise heuristics for finding clusterings leading to good approximations. We illustrate the quality and feasibility of the approach through experimental data.",0
"Classically, risk is characterized by a point value probability indicating the likelihood of occurrence of an adverse effect. However, there are domains where the attainability of objective numerical risk characterizations is increasingly being questioned. This paper reviews the arguments in favour of extending classical techniques of risk assessment to incorporate meaningful qualitative and weak quantitative risk characterizations. A technique in which linguistic uncertainty terms are defined in terms of patterns of argument is then proposed. The technique is demonstrated using a prototype computer-based system for predicting the carcinogenic risk due to novel chemical compounds.",0

To enhance effectiveness of calculations, algorithm has been parallelized using OpenMP library. We gained much increase in speed on platforms using multithreaded processors with shared memory free access. During analysis we used different modifications of genetic operator, using them we obtained varied evolution process of potential solutions. Results allow to choose best methods among many applied in genetic algorithms and observation of acceleration on Yorkfield, Bloomfield, Westmere-EX and most recent Sandy Bridge cores.",0
"Most real-world Planning problems are multi-objective, trying to minimize both the makespan of the solution plan, and some cost of the actions involved in the plan. But most, if not all existing approaches are based on single-objective planners, and use an aggregation of the objectives to remain in the single-objective context. Divide and Evolve (DaE) is an evolutionary planner that won the temporal deterministic satisficing track at the last International Planning Competitions (IPC). Like all Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), it can easily be turned into a Pareto-based Multi-Objective EA. It is however important to validate the resulting algorithm by comparing it with the aggregation approach: this is the goal of this paper. The comparative experiments on a recently proposed benchmark set that are reported here demonstrate the usefulness of going Pareto-based in AI Planning.",0
"The paper presents a method for reducing the computational complexity of Bayesian networks through identification and removal of weak dependencies (removal of links from the (moralized) independence graph). The removal of a small number of links may reduce the computational complexity dramatically, since several fill-ins and moral links may be rendered superfluous by the removal. The method is described in terms of impact on the independence graph, the junction tree, and the potential functions associated with these. An empirical evaluation of the method using large real-world networks demonstrates the applicability of the method. Further, the method, which has been implemented in Hugin, complements the approximation method suggested by Jensen &amp; Andersen (1990).",0
"Monte Carlo sampling has become a major vehicle for approximate inference in Bayesian networks. In this paper, we investigate a family of related simulation approaches, known collectively as quasi-Monte Carlo methods based on deterministic low-discrepancy sequences. We first outline several theoretical aspects of deterministic low-discrepancy sequences, show three examples of such sequences, and then discuss practical issues related to applying them to belief updating in Bayesian networks. We propose an algorithm for selecting direction numbers for Sobol sequence. Our experimental results show that low-discrepancy sequences (especially Sobol sequence) significantly improve the performance of simulation algorithms in Bayesian networks compared to Monte Carlo sampling.",0
"We introduce a method to learn a hierarchy of successively more abstract representations of complex data based on optimizing an information-theoretic objective. Intuitively, the optimization searches for the simplest set of factors that can explain the correlations in the data as measured by multivariate mutual information. The method is unsupervised, requires no model assumptions, and scales linearly with the number of variables which makes it an attractive approach for very high dimensional systems. We demonstrate that Correlation Explanation (CorEx) automatically discovers meaningful structure for data from diverse sources including personality tests, DNA, and human language.",1
"For agents and robots to become more useful, they must be able to quickly learn from non-technical users. This paper investigates the problem of interactively learning behaviors communicated by a human teacher using positive and negative feedback. Much previous work on this problem has made the assumption that people provide feedback for decisions that is dependent on the behavior they are teaching and is independent from the learner's current policy. We present empirical results that show this assumption to be false---whether human trainers give a positive or negative feedback for a decision is influenced by the learner's current policy. We argue that policy-dependent feedback, in addition to being commonplace, enables useful training strategies from which agents should benefit. Based on this insight, we introduce Convergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH), an algorithm for learning from policy-dependent feedback that converges to a local optimum. Finally, we demonstrate that COACH can successfully learn multiple behaviors on a physical robot, even with noisy image features.",1
"The most recent financial upheavals have cast doubt on the adequacy of some of the conventional quantitative risk management strategies, such as VaR (Value at Risk), in many common situations. Consequently, there has been an increasing need for verisimilar financial stress testings, namely simulating and analyzing financial portfolios in extreme, albeit rare scenarios. Unlike conventional risk management which exploits statistical correlations among financial instruments, here we focus our analysis on the notion of probabilistic causation, which is embodied by Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs), SBCNs are probabilistic graphical models that have many attractive features in terms of more accurate causal analysis for generating financial stress scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach for conducting stress testing of financial portfolios based on SBCNs in combination with classical machine learning classification tools. The resulting method is shown to be capable of correctly discovering the causal relationships among financial factors that affect the portfolios and thus, simulating stress testing scenarios with a higher accuracy and lower computational complexity than conventional Monte Carlo Simulations.",0
"In this article using Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm and simple additive weighting method the hybrid COAW algorithm is presented to solve multi-objective problems. Cuckoo algorithm is an efficient and structured method for solving nonlinear continuous problems. The created Pareto frontiers of the COAW proposed algorithm are exact and have good dispersion. This method has a high speed in finding the Pareto frontiers and identifies the beginning and end points of Pareto frontiers properly. In order to validation the proposed algorithm, several experimental problems were analyzed. The results of which indicate the proper effectiveness of COAW algorithm for solving multi-objective problems.",0
"Qualitative probabilistic reasoning in a Bayesian network often reveals tradeoffs: relationships that are ambiguous due to competing qualitative influences. We present two techniques that combine qualitative and numeric probabilistic reasoning to resolve such tradeoffs, inferring the qualitative relationship between nodes in a Bayesian network. The first approach incrementally marginalizes nodes that contribute to the ambiguous qualitative relationships. The second approach evaluates approximate Bayesian networks for bounds of probability distributions, and uses these bounds to determinate qualitative relationships in question. This approach is also incremental in that the algorithm refines the state spaces of random variables for tighter bounds until the qualitative relationships are resolved. Both approaches provide systematic methods for tradeoff resolution at potentially lower computational cost than application of purely numeric methods.",0
"Condorcet winning sets are a set-valued generalization of the well-known concept of a Condorcet winner. As supersets of Condorcet winning sets are always Condorcet winning sets themselves, an interesting property of preference profiles is the size of the smallest Condorcet winning set they admit. This smallest size is called the Condorcet dimension of a preference profile. Since little is known about profiles that have a certain Condorcet dimension, we show in this paper how the problem of finding a preference profile that has a given Condorcet dimension can be encoded as a satisfiability problem and solved by a SAT solver. Initial results include a minimal example of a preference profile of Condorcet dimension 3, improving previously known examples both in terms of the number of agents as well as alternatives. Due to the high complexity of such problems it remains open whether a preference profile of Condorcet dimension 4 exists.",0
"Learning from electronic medical records (EMR) is challenging due to their relational nature and the uncertain dependence between a patient's past and future health status. Statistical relational learning is a natural fit for analyzing EMRs but is less adept at handling their inherent latent structure, such as connections between related medications or diseases. One way to capture the latent structure is via a relational clustering of objects. We propose a novel approach that, instead of pre-clustering the objects, performs a demand-driven clustering during learning. We evaluate our algorithm on three real-world tasks where the goal is to use EMRs to predict whether a patient will have an adverse reaction to a medication. We find that our approach is more accurate than performing no clustering, pre-clustering, and using expert-constructed medical heterarchies.",1
"Information fusion is an advanced research area which can assist decision makers in enhancing their decisions. This paper aims at designing a new multi-layer framework that can support the process of performing decisions from the obtained beliefs using information fusion. Since it is not an easy task to cross the gap between computed beliefs of certain hypothesis and decisions, the proposed framework consists of the following layers in order to provide a suitable architecture (ordered bottom up): 1. A layer for combination of basic belief assignments using an information fusion approach. Such approach exploits Dezert-Smarandache Theory, DSmT, and proportional conflict redistribution to provide more realistic final beliefs. 2. A layer for computation of pignistic probability of the underlying propositions from the corresponding final beliefs. 3. A layer for performing probabilistic reasoning using a Bayesian network that can obtain the probable reason of a proposition from its pignistic probability. 4. Ranking the system decisions is ultimately used to support decision making. A case study has been accomplished at various operational conditions in order to prove the concept, in addition it pointed out that: 1. The use of DSmT for information fusion yields not only more realistic beliefs but also reliable pignistic probabilities for the underlying propositions. 2. Exploiting the pignistic probability for the integration of the information fusion with the Bayesian network provides probabilistic inference and enable decision making on the basis of both belief based probabilities for the underlying propositions and Bayesian based probabilities for the corresponding reasons. A comparative study of the proposed framework with respect to other information fusion systems confirms its superiority to support decision making.",0
"As the practical use of answer set programming (ASP) has grown with the development of efficient solvers, we expect a growing interest in extensions of ASP as their semantics stabilize and solvers supporting them mature. Epistemic Specifications, which adds modal operators K and M to the language of ASP, is one such extension. We call a program in this language an epistemic logic program (ELP). Solvers have thus far been practical for only the simplest ELPs due to exponential growth of the memory required. We describe a solver that is able to solve harder problems better (without exponentially-growing memory needs w.r.t. K and M occurrences) and faster than any other known ELP solver.",0
"Autonomous driving has been the subject of increased interest in recent years both in industry and in academia. Serious efforts are being pursued to address legal, technical and logistical problems and make autonomous cars a viable option for everyday transportation. One significant challenge is the time and effort required for the verification and validation of the decision and control algorithms employed in these vehicles to ensure a safe and comfortable driving experience. Hundreds of thousands of miles of driving tests are required to achieve a well calibrated control system that is capable of operating an autonomous vehicle in an uncertain traffic environment where multiple interactions between vehicles and drivers simultaneously occur. Traffic simulators where these interactions can be modeled and represented with reasonable fidelity can help decrease the time and effort necessary for the development of the autonomous driving control algorithms by providing a venue where acceptable initial control calibrations can be achieved quickly and safely before actual road tests. In this paper, we present a game theoretic traffic model that can be used to 1) test and compare various autonomous vehicle decision and control systems and 2) calibrate the parameters of an existing control system. We demonstrate two example case studies, where, in the first case, we test and quantitatively compare two autonomous vehicle control systems in terms of their safety and performance, and, in the second case, we optimize the parameters of an autonomous vehicle control system, utilizing the proposed traffic model and simulation environment.",0
"Previous studies have demonstrated that encoding a Bayesian network into a SAT formula and then performing weighted model counting using a backtracking search algorithm can be an effective method for exact inference. In this paper, we present techniques for improving this approach for Bayesian networks with noisy-OR and noisy-MAX relations---two relations that are widely used in practice as they can dramatically reduce the number of probabilities one needs to specify. In particular, we present two SAT encodings for noisy-OR and two encodings for noisy-MAX that exploit the structure or semantics of the relations to improve both time and space efficiency, and we prove the correctness of the encodings. We experimentally evaluated our techniques on large-scale real and randomly generated Bayesian networks. On these benchmarks, our techniques gave speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over the best previous approaches for networks with noisy-OR/MAX relations and scaled up to larger networks. As well, our techniques extend the weighted model counting approach for exact inference to networks that were previously intractable for the approach.",0
"The small body of previous work considering the design of wind farms has used arrays of turbines originally intended to operate alone, optimising the layout of homogeneous turbines essentially as an afterthought in the design process. In this paper, we consider designing wind farms composed of collaborating wind turbines. Computational intelligence is combined with rapid prototyping whereby candidate designs are physically instantiated and evaluated under fan-generated wind conditions. It is shown possible to use surrogate-assisted coevolutionary algorithms to aerodynamically optimise the potentially heterogeneous morphology of an array of 6 small scale and closely positioned vertical-axis wind turbines using the total angular kinetic energy of the array as the objective. This approach performs optimisation in the presence of complex inter-turbine wake effects and multi-directional wind flow from nearby obstacles, which is extremely difficult to achieve accurately under high fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulation. The general approach is equally applicable to the design of other forms of sustainable energy where the characteristics of the environment and/or materials involved are too difficult to accurately simulate.",0
"The goal of this paper is to identify individuals by analyzing their gait. Instead of using binary silhouettes as input data (as done in many previous works) we propose and evaluate the use of motion descriptors based on densely sampled short-term trajectories. We take advantage of state-of-the-art people detectors to define custom spatial configurations of the descriptors around the target person, obtaining a rich representation of the gait motion. The local motion features (described by the Divergence-Curl-Shear descriptor) extracted on the different spatial areas of the person are combined into a single high-level gait descriptor by using the Fisher Vector encoding. The proposed approach, coined Pyramidal Fisher Motion, is experimentally validated on `CASIA' dataset (parts B and C), `TUM GAID' dataset, `CMU MoBo' dataset and the recent `AVA Multiview Gait' dataset. The results show that this new approach achieves state-of-the-art results in the problem of gait recognition, allowing to recognize walking people from diverse viewpoints on single and multiple camera setups, wearing different clothes, carrying bags, walking at diverse speeds and not limited to straight walking paths.",0
Accurate prediction of wind ramp events is critical for ensuring the reliability and stability of the power systems with high penetration of wind energy. This paper proposes a classification based approach for estimating the future class of wind ramp event based on certain thresholds. A parallelized gradient boosted regression tree based technique has been proposed to accurately classify the normal as well as rare extreme wind power ramp events. The model has been validated using wind power data obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory database. Performance comparison with several benchmark techniques indicates the superiority of the proposed technique in terms of superior classification accuracy.,0
"In this paper, we address the knowledge engineering problems for hypothesis generation motivated by applications that require timely exploration of hypotheses under unreliable observations. We looked at two applications: malware detection and intensive care delivery. In intensive care, the goal is to generate plausible hypotheses about the condition of the patient from clinical observations and further refine these hypotheses to create a recovery plan for the patient. Similarly, preventing malware spread within a corporate network involves generating hypotheses from network traffic data and selecting preventive actions. To this end, building on the already established characterization and use of AI planning for similar problems, we propose use of planning for the hypothesis generation problem. However, to deal with uncertainty, incomplete model description and unreliable observations, we need to use a planner capable of generating multiple high-quality plans. To capture the model description we propose a language called LTS++ and a web-based tool that enables the specification of the LTS++ model and a set of observations. We also proposed a 9-step process that helps provide guidance to the domain expert in specifying the LTS++ model. The hypotheses are then generated by running a planner on the translated LTS++ model and the provided trace. The hypotheses can be visualized and shown to the analyst or can be further investigated automatically.",0
"In Constraint Programming, global constraints allow to model and solve many combinatorial problems. Among these constraints, several sortedness constraints have been defined, for which propagation algorithms are available, but for which the tractability is not settled. We show that the sort(U,V) constraint (Older et. al, 1995) is intractable for integer variables whose domains are not limited to intervals. As a consequence, the similar result holds for the sort(U,V, P) constraint (Zhou, 1996). Moreover, the intractability holds even under the stability condition present in the recently introduced keysorting(U,V,Keys,P) constraint (Carlsson et al., 2014), and requiring that the order of the variables with the same value in the list U be preserved in the list V. Therefore, keysorting(U,V,Keys,P) is intractable as well.",0
"In order to improve children speech therapy, we develop a Fuzzy Expert System based on a speech therapy guide. This guide, write in natural language, was formalized using fuzzy logic paradigm. In this manner we obtain a knowledge base with over 150 rules and 19 linguistic variables. All these researches, including expert system validation, are part of TERAPERS project.",0
"We consider filtering for a continuous-time, or asynchronous, stochastic system where the full distribution over states is too large to be stored or calculated. We assume that the rate matrix of the system can be compactly represented and that the belief distribution is to be approximated as a product of marginals. The essential computation is the matrix exponential. We look at two different methods for its computation: ODE integration and uniformization of the Taylor expansion. For both we consider approximations in which only a factored belief state is maintained. For factored uniformization we demonstrate that the KL-divergence of the filtering is bounded. Our experimental results confirm our factored uniformization performs better than previously suggested uniformization methods and the mean field algorithm.",0
"We present a functional framework for automated mechanism design based on a two-stage game model of strategic interaction between the designer and the mechanism participants, and apply it to several classes of two-player infinite games of incomplete information. At the core of our framework is a black-box optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate mechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions. By comparing our results with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric design of indirect mechanisms.",0
"Convolutional neural networks demonstrated outstanding empirical results in computer vision and speech recognition tasks where labeled training data is abundant. In medical imaging, there is a huge variety of possible imaging modalities and contrasts, where annotated data is usually very scarce. We present two approaches to deal with this challenge. A network pretrained in a different domain with abundant data is used as a feature extractor, while a subsequent classifier is trained on a small target dataset; and a deep architecture trained with heavy augmentation and equipped with sophisticated regularization methods. We test the approaches on a corpus of X-ray images to design an anatomy detection system.",0
"The degree of success in document summarization processes depends on the performance of the method used in identifying significant sentences in the documents. The collection of unique words characterizes the major signature of the document, and forms the basis for Term-Sentence-Matrix (TSM). The Positive Pointwise Mutual Information, which works well for measuring semantic similarity in the Term-Sentence-Matrix, is used in our method to assign weights for each entry in the Term-Sentence-Matrix. The Sentence-Rank-Matrix generated from this weighted TSM, is then used to extract a summary from the document. Our experiments show that such a method would outperform most of the existing methods in producing summaries from large documents.",0
We present an experimental setup and procedure for benchmarking numerical optimization algorithms in a black-box scenario. This procedure can be applied with the COCO benchmarking platform. We describe initialization of and input to the algorithm and touch upon the relevance of termination and restarts. We introduce the concept of recommendations for benchmarking with COCO. Recommendations detach the solutions used in function calls from the anytime performance assessment of the algorithm.,0
"A key part of any evolutionary algorithm is fitness evaluation. When fitness evaluations are corrupted by noise, as happens in many real-world problems as a consequence of various types of uncertainty, a strategy is needed in order to cope with this. Resampling is one of the most common strategies, whereby each solution is evaluated many times in order to reduce the variance of the fitness estimates. When evaluating the performance of a noisy optimisation algorithm, a key consideration is the stopping condition for the algorithm. A frequently used stopping condition in runtime analysis, known as ""First Hitting Time"", is to stop the algorithm as soon as it encounters the optimal solution. However, this is unrealistic for real-world problems, as if the optimal solution were already known, there would be no need to search for it. This paper argues that the use of First Hitting Time, despite being a commonly used approach, is significantly flawed and overestimates the quality of many algorithms in real-world cases, where the optimum is not known in advance and has to be genuinely searched for. A better alternative is to measure the quality of the solution an algorithm returns after a fixed evaluation budget, i.e., to focus on final solution quality. This paper argues that focussing on final solution quality is more realistic and demonstrates cases where the results produced by each algorithm evaluation method lead to very different conclusions regarding the quality of each noisy optimisation algorithm.",0
"We introduce an approach to high-level conditional planning we call epsilon-safe planning. This probabilistic approach commits us to planning to meet some specified goal with a probability of success of at least 1-epsilon for some user-supplied epsilon. We describe several algorithms for epsilon-safe planning based on conditional planners. The two conditional planners we discuss are Peot and Smith's nonlinear conditional planner, CNLP, and our own linear conditional planner, PLINTH. We present a straightforward extension to conditional planners for which computing the necessary probabilities is simple, employing a commonly-made but perhaps overly-strong independence assumption. We also discuss a second approach to epsilon-safe planning which relaxes this independence assumption, involving the incremental construction of a probability dependence model in conjunction with the construction of the plan graph.",0
"In this paper, we consider one aspect of the problem of applying decision theory to the design of agents that learn how to make decisions under uncertainty. This aspect concerns how an agent can estimate probabilities for the possible states of the world, given that it only makes limited observations before committing to a decision. We show that the naive application of statistical tools can be improved upon if the agent can determine which of his observations are truly relevant to the estimation problem at hand. We give a framework in which such determinations can be made, and define an estimation procedure to use them. Our framework also suggests several extensions, which show how additional knowledge can be used to improve tile estimation procedure still further.",0
"Decentralized planning in uncertain environments is a complex task generally dealt with by using a decision-theoretic approach, mainly through the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDPs). Although DEC-POMDPS are a general and powerful modeling tool, solving them is a task with an overwhelming complexity that can be doubly exponential. In this paper, we study an alternate formulation of DEC-POMDPs relying on a sequence-form representation of policies. From this formulation, we show how to derive Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that, once solved, give exact optimal solutions to the DEC-POMDPs. We show that these MILPs can be derived either by using some combinatorial characteristics of the optimal solutions of the DEC-POMDPs or by using concepts borrowed from game theory. Through an experimental validation on classical test problems from the DEC-POMDP literature, we compare our approach to existing algorithms. Results show that mathematical programming outperforms dynamic programming but is less efficient than forward search, except for some particular problems. The main contributions of this work are the use of mathematical programming for DEC-POMDPs and a better understanding of DEC-POMDPs and of their solutions. Besides, we argue that our alternate representation of DEC-POMDPs could be helpful for designing novel algorithms looking for approximate solutions to DEC-POMDPs.",0
"Autonomous software agents operating in dynamic environments need to constantly reason about actions in pursuit of their goals, while taking into consideration norms which might be imposed on those actions. Normative practical reasoning supports agents making decisions about what is best for them to (not) do in a given situation. What makes practical reasoning challenging is the interplay between goals that agents are pursuing and the norms that the agents are trying to uphold. We offer a formalisation to allow agents to plan for multiple goals and norms in the presence of durative actions that can be executed concurrently. We compare plans based on decision-theoretic notions (i.e. utility) such that the utility gain of goals and utility loss of norm violations are the basis for this comparison. The set of optimal plans consists of plans that maximise the overall utility, each of which can be chosen by the agent to execute. We provide an implementation of our proposal in Answer Set Programming, thus allowing us to state the original problem in terms of a logic program that can be queried for solutions with specific properties. The implementation is proven to be sound and complete.",0
"Argumentation is based on the exchange and valuation of interacting arguments, followed by the selection of the most acceptable of them (for example, in order to take a decision, to make a choice). Starting from the framework proposed by Dung in 1995, our purpose is to introduce 'graduality' in the selection of the best arguments, i.e., to be able to partition the set of the arguments in more than the two usual subsets of 'selected' and 'non-selected' arguments in order to represent different levels of selection. Our basic idea is that an argument is all the more acceptable if it can be preferred to its attackers. First, we discuss general principles underlying a 'gradual' valuation of arguments based on their interactions. Following these principles, we define several valuation models for an abstract argumentation system. Then, we introduce 'graduality' in the concept of acceptability of arguments. We propose new acceptability classes and a refinement of existing classes taking advantage of an available 'gradual' valuation.",0
"In imitation learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment with an unknown cost function by mimicking expert demonstrations. Existing imitation learning algorithms typically involve solving a sequence of planning or reinforcement learning problems. Such algorithms are therefore not directly applicable to large, high-dimensional environments, and their performance can significantly degrade if the planning problems are not solved to optimality. Under the apprenticeship learning formalism, we develop alternative model-free algorithms for finding a parameterized stochastic policy that performs at least as well as an expert policy on an unknown cost function, based on sample trajectories from the expert. Our approach, based on policy gradients, scales to large continuous environments with guaranteed convergence to local minima.",1
Poole has shown that nonmonotonic logics do not handle the lottery paradox correctly. In this paper we will show that Pollock's theory of defeasible reasoning fails for the same reason: defeasible reasoning is incompatible with the skeptical notion of derivability.,0
"We discuss the problem in which an autonomous vehicle must classify an object based on multiple views. We focus on the active classification setting, where the vehicle controls which views to select to best perform the classification. The problem is formulated as an extension to Bayesian active learning, and we show connections to recent theoretical guarantees in this area. We formally analyze the benefit of acting adaptively as new information becomes available. The analysis leads to a probabilistic algorithm for determining the best views to observe based on information theoretic costs. We validate our approach in two ways, both related to underwater inspection: 3D polyhedra recognition in synthetic depth maps and ship hull inspection with imaging sonar. These tasks encompass both the planning and recognition aspects of the active classification problem. The results demonstrate that actively planning for informative views can reduce the number of necessary views by up to 80% when compared to passive methods.",0
"Most of the metaheuristics can efficiently solve unconstrained problems; however, their performance may degenerate if the constraints are involved. This paper proposes two constraint handling approaches for an emerging metaheuristic of Cohort Intelligence (CI). More specifically CI with static penalty function approach (SCI) and CI with dynamic penalty function approach (DCI) are proposed. The approaches have been tested by solving several constrained test problems. The performance of the SCI and DCI have been compared with algorithms like GA, PSO, ABC, d-Ds. In addition, as well as three real world problems from mechanical engineering domain with improved solutions. The results were satisfactory and validated the applicability of CI methodology for solving real world problems.",0
"A useful step towards better interpretation and analysis of the usage patterns is to formalize the semantics of the resources that users are accessing in the Web. We focus on this problem and present an approach for the semantic formalization of usage logs, which lays the basis for eective techniques of querying expressive usage patterns. We also present a query answering approach, which is useful to nd in the logs expressive patterns of usage behavior via formulation of semantic and temporal-based constraints. We have processed over 30 thousand user browsing sessions extracted from usage logs of DBPedia and Semantic Web Dog Food. All these events are formalized semantically using respective domain ontologies and RDF representations of the Web resources being accessed. We show the eectiveness of our approach through experimental results, providing in this way an exploratory analysis of the way users browse theWeb of Data.",0
"This paper introduces a novel self-learning framework that automates the label acquisition process for improving models for detecting players in broadcast footage of sports games. Unlike most previous self-learning approaches for improving appearance-based object detectors from videos, we allow an unknown, unconstrained number of target objects in a more generalized video sequence with non-static camera views. Our self-learning approach uses a latent SVM learning algorithm and deformable part models to represent the shape and colour information of players, constraining their motions, and learns the colour of the playing field by a gentle Adaboost algorithm. We combine those image cues and discover additional labels automatically from unlabelled data. In our experiments, our approach exploits both labelled and unlabelled data in sparsely labelled videos of sports games, providing a mean performance improvement of over 20% in the average precision for detecting sports players and improved tracking, when videos contain very few labelled images.",0
"In digital-based information boom, the fuzzy covering rough set model is an important mathematical tool for artificial intelligence, and how to build the bridge between the fuzzy covering rough set theory and Pawlak's model is becoming a hot research topic. In this paper, we first present the $\gamma-$fuzzy covering based probabilistic and grade approximation operators and double-quantitative approximation operators. We also study the relationships among the three types of $\gamma-$fuzzy covering based approximation operators. Second, we propose the $\gamma^{\ast}-$fuzzy coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators and multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. We also investigate the relationships among these types of $\gamma-$fuzzy coverings based approximation operators. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate how to construct the lower and upper approximations of fuzzy sets with the absolute and relative quantitative information.",0
"In Multi-Source Feedback or 360 Degree Feedback, data on the performance of an individual are collected systematically from a number of stakeholders and are used for improving performance. The 360-Degree Feedback approach provides a consistent management philosophy meeting the criterion outlined previously. The 360-degree feedback appraisal process describes a human resource methodology that is frequently used for both employee appraisal and employee development. Used in employee performance appraisals, the 360-degree feedback methodology is differentiated from traditional, top-down appraisal methods in which the supervisor responsible for the appraisal provides the majority of the data. Instead it seeks to use information gained from other sources to provide a fuller picture of employees' performances. Similarly, when this technique used in employee development it augments employees' perceptions of training needs with those of the people with whom they interact. The 360-degree feedback based appraisal is a comprehensive method where in the feedback about the employee comes from all the sources that come into contact with the employee on his/her job. The respondents for an employee can be her/his peers, managers, subordinates team members, customers, suppliers and vendors. Hence anyone who comes into contact with the employee, the 360 degree appraisal has four components that include self-appraisal, superior's appraisal, subordinate's appraisal student's appraisal and peer's appraisal .The proposed system is an attempt to implement the 360 degree feedback based appraisal system in academics especially engineering colleges.",0
"We describe a novel approach for computing collision-free \emph{global} trajectories for $p$ agents with specified initial and final configurations, based on an improved version of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Compared with existing methods, our approach is naturally parallelizable and allows for incorporating different cost functionals with only minor adjustments. We apply our method to classical challenging instances and observe that its computational requirements scale well with $p$ for several cost functionals. We also show that a specialization of our algorithm can be used for {\em local} motion planning by solving the problem of joint optimization in velocity space.",1
"We propose using recognition networks for approximate inference inBayesian networks (BNs). A recognition network is a multilayerperception (MLP) trained to predict posterior marginals given observedevidence in a particular BN. The input to the MLP is a vector of thestates of the evidential nodes. The activity of an output unit isinterpreted as a prediction of the posterior marginal of thecorresponding variable. The MLP is trained using samples generated fromthe corresponding BN.We evaluate a recognition network that was trained to do inference ina large Bayesian network, similar in structure and complexity to theQuick Medical Reference, Decision Theoretic (QMR-DT). Our networkis a binary, two-layer, noisy-OR network containing over 4000 potentially observable nodes and over 600 unobservable, hidden nodes. Inreal medical diagnosis, most observables are unavailable, and there isa complex and unknown bias that selects which ones are provided. Weincorporate a very basic type of selection bias in our network: a knownpreference that available observables are positive rather than negative.Even this simple bias has a significant effect on the posterior. We compare the performance of our recognition network tostate-of-the-art approximate inference algorithms on a large set oftest cases. In order to evaluate the effect of our simplistic modelof the selection bias, we evaluate algorithms using a variety ofincorrectly modeled observation biases. Recognition networks performwell using both correct and incorrect observation biases.",0
"We present the sTeX+ system, a user-driven advancement of sTeX - a semantic extension of LaTeX that allows for producing high-quality PDF documents for (proof)reading and printing, as well as semantic XML/OMDoc documents for the Web or further processing. Originally sTeX had been created as an invasive, semantic frontend for authoring XML documents. Here, we used sTeX in a Software Engineering case study as a formalization tool. In order to deal with modular pre-semantic vocabularies and relations, we upgraded it to sTeX+ in a participatory design process. We present a tool chain that starts with an sTeX+ editor and ultimately serves the generated documents as XHTML+RDFa Linked Data via an OMDoc-enabled, versioned XML database. In the final output, all structural annotations are preserved in order to enable semantic information retrieval services.",0
"Penetration testing is a well-established practical concept for the identification of potentially exploitable security weaknesses and an important component of a security audit. Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter- measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conduct- ing comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. We determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these what-if analysis models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.",0
"In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting.",1
"A major investment made by a telecom operator goes into the infrastructure and its maintenance, while business revenues are proportional to how big and good the customer base is. We present a data-driven analytic strategy based on combinatorial optimization and analysis of historical data. The data cover historical mobility of the users in one region of Sweden during a week. Applying the proposed method to the case study, we have identified the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base, developed a functionality to assess the potential of a planned marketing campaign, and explored the problem of an optimal number and types of the geo-demographic segments to target through marketing campaigns. With the help of fuzzy logic, the conclusions of data analysis are automatically translated into comprehensible recommendations in a natural language.",0
"A combined Short-Term Learning (STL) and Long-Term Learning (LTL) approach to solving mobile-robot navigation problems is presented and tested in both the real and virtual domains. The LTL phase consists of rapid simulations that use a Genetic Algorithm to derive diverse sets of behaviours, encoded as variable sets of attributes, and the STL phase is an idiotypic Artificial Immune System. Results from the LTL phase show that sets of behaviours develop very rapidly, and significantly greater diversity is obtained when multiple autonomous populations are used, rather than a single one. The architecture is assessed under various scenarios, including removal of the LTL phase and switching off the idiotypic mechanism in the STL phase. The comparisons provide substantial evidence that the best option is the inclusion of both the LTL phase and the idiotypic system. In addition, this paper shows that structurally different environments can be used for the two phases without compromising transferability.",0
"The cutting plane method is an augmentative constrained optimization procedure that is often used with continuous-domain optimization techniques such as linear and convex programs. We investigate the viability of a similar idea within message passing -- which produces integral solutions -- in the context of two combinatorial problems: 1) For Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we propose a factor-graph based on Held-Karp formulation, with an exponential number of constraint factors, each of which has an exponential but sparse tabular form. 2) For graph-partitioning (a.k.a., community mining) using modularity optimization, we introduce a binary variable model with a large number of constraints that enforce formation of cliques. In both cases we are able to derive surprisingly simple message updates that lead to competitive solutions on benchmark instances. In particular for TSP we are able to find near-optimal solutions in the time that empirically grows with N^3, demonstrating that augmentation is practical and efficient.",1
"Bilinear models provide rich representations compared to linear models. They have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition, segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However, bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear neural networks using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), commonly implemented in many scientific computing frameworks. We show that our model outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks, having a better parsimonious property.",1
"Multi-mode resource and precedence-constrained project scheduling is a well-known challenging real-world optimisation problem. An important variant of the problem requires scheduling of activities for multiple projects considering availability of local and global resources while respecting a range of constraints. This problem has been addressed by a competition, and associated set of benchmark instances, as a part of the MISTA 2013 conference. A critical aspect of the benchmarks is that the primary objective is to minimise the sum of the project completion times, with the usual makespan minimisation as a secondary objective. We observe that this leads to an expected different overall structure of good solutions and discuss the effects this has on the algorithm design. This paper presents the resulting competition winning approach; it is a carefully designed hybrid of Monte-Carlo tree search, novel neighbourhood moves, memetic algorithms, and hyper-heuristic methods. The implementation is also engineered to increase the speed with which iterations are performed, and to exploit the computing power of multicore machines. The resulting information-sharing multi-component algorithm significantly outperformed the other approaches during the competition, producing the best solution for 17 out of the 20 test instances and performing the best in around 90% of all the trials.",0
"Sometime in the future we will have to deal with the impact of AI's being mistaken for humans. For this reason, I propose that any autonomous system should be designed so that it is unlikely to be mistaken for anything besides an autonomous sysem, and should identify itself at the start of any interaction with another agent.",0

"We study hedonic games with dichotomous preferences. Hedonic games are cooperative games in which players desire to form coalitions, but only care about the makeup of the coalitions of which they are members; they are indifferent about the makeup of other coalitions. The assumption of dichotomous preferences means that, additionally, each player's preference relation partitions the set of coalitions of which that player is a member into just two equivalence classes: satisfactory and unsatisfactory. A player is indifferent between satisfactory coalitions, and is indifferent between unsatisfactory coalitions, but strictly prefers any satisfactory coalition over any unsatisfactory coalition. We develop a succinct representation for such games, in which each player's preference relation is represented by a propositional formula. We show how solution concepts for hedonic games with dichotomous preferences are characterised by propositional formulas.",0
The concepts of fuzzy objects and their classes are described that make it possible to structurally represent knowledge about fuzzy and partially-defined objects and their classes. Operations over such objects and classes are also proposed that make it possible to obtain sets and new classes of fuzzy objects and also to model variations in object structures under the influence of external factors.,0
"Domain-specific features are important in representing problem structure throughout machine learning and decision-theoretic planning. In planning, once state features are provided, domain-independent algorithms such as approximate value iteration can learn weighted combinations of those features that often perform well as heuristic estimates of state value (e.g., distance to the goal). Successful applications in real-world domains often require features crafted by human experts. Here, we propose automatic processes for learning useful domain-specific feature sets with little or no human intervention. Our methods select and add features that describe state-space regions of high inconsistency in the Bellman equation (statewise Bellman error) during approximate value iteration. Our method can be applied using any real-valued-feature hypothesis space and corresponding learning method for selecting features from training sets of state-value pairs. We evaluate the method with hypothesis spaces defined by both relational and propositional feature languages, using nine probabilistic planning domains. We show that approximate value iteration using a relational feature space performs at the state-of-the-art in domain-independent stochastic relational planning. Our method provides the first domain-independent approach that plays Tetris successfully (without human-engineered features).",0
"Accepting a proposition means that our confidence in this proposition is strictly greater than the confidence in its negation. This paper investigates the subclass of uncertainty measures, expressing confidence, that capture the idea of acceptance, what we call acceptance functions. Due to the monotonicity property of confidence measures, the acceptance of a proposition entails the acceptance of any of its logical consequences. In agreement with the idea that a belief set (in the sense of Gardenfors) must be closed under logical consequence, it is also required that the separate acceptance o two propositions entail the acceptance of their conjunction. Necessity (and possibility) measures agree with this view of acceptance while probability and belief functions generally do not. General properties of acceptance functions are estabilished. The motivation behind this work is the investigation of a setting for belief revision more general than the one proposed by Alchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson, in connection with the notion of conditioning.",0
"Probabilistic logic programs are logic programs in which some of the facts are annotated with probabilities. Several classical probabilistic inference tasks (such as MAP and computing marginals) have not yet received a lot of attention for this formalism. The contribution of this paper is that we develop efficient inference algorithms for these tasks. This is based on a conversion of the probabilistic logic program and the query and evidence to a weighted CNF formula. This allows us to reduce the inference tasks to well-studied tasks such as weighted model counting. To solve such tasks, we employ state-of-the-art methods. We consider multiple methods for the conversion of the programs as well as for inference on the weighted CNF. The resulting approach is evaluated experimentally and shown to improve upon the state-of-the-art in probabilistic logic programming.",0
"The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) has gained momentum, thanks to its suitability in capturing complex problems (e.g., multi-agent coordination and resource allocation problems) that are naturally distributed and cannot be realistically addressed in a centralized manner. The state-of-the-art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures and ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an infrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming technologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint solver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the agent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic programming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of performance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced technology (e.g., search strategies, complex constraints) for solving DCOPs.",0
"Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor impeding its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of human-annotated data. Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding is required to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 72.4% and 75.8% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by over 5% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this task.",1
"Machine-learning techniques have been recently used with spectacular results to generate artefacts such as music or text. However, these techniques are still unable to capture and generate artefacts that are convincingly structured. In this paper we present an approach to generate structured musical sequences. We introduce a mechanism for sampling efficiently variations of musical sequences. Given a input sequence and a statistical model, this mechanism samples a set of sequences whose distance to the input sequence is approximately within specified bounds. This mechanism is implemented as an extension of belief propagation, and uses local fields to bias the generation. We show experimentally that sampled sequences are indeed closely correlated to the standard musical similarity measure defined by Mongeau and Sankoff. We then show how this mechanism can used to implement composition strategies that enforce arbitrary structure on a musical lead sheet generation problem.",0
The paper presents an approach to verification of a multi-agent data analysis algorithm. We base correct simulation of the multi-agent system by a finite integer model. For verification we use model checking tool SPIN. Protocols of agents are written in Promela language and properties of the multi-agent data analysis system are expressed in logic LTL. We run several experiments with SPIN and the model.,0
"Using the notion of an elementary loop, Gebser and Schaub refined the theorem on loop formulas due to Lin and Zhao by considering loop formulas of elementary loops only. In this article, we reformulate their definition of an elementary loop, extend it to disjunctive programs, and study several properties of elementary loops, including how maximal elementary loops are related to minimal unfounded sets. The results provide useful insights into the stable model semantics in terms of elementary loops. For a nondisjunctive program, using a graph-theoretic characterization of an elementary loop, we show that the problem of recognizing an elementary loop is tractable. On the other hand, we show that the corresponding problem is {\sf coNP}-complete for a disjunctive program. Based on the notion of an elementary loop, we present the class of Head-Elementary-loop-Free (HEF) programs, which strictly generalizes the class of Head-Cycle-Free (HCF) programs due to Ben-Eliyahu and Dechter. Like an HCF program, an HEF program can be turned into an equivalent nondisjunctive program in polynomial time by shifting head atoms into the body.",0
"We present NewsQA, a challenging machine comprehension dataset of over 100,000 question-answer pairs. Crowdworkers supply questions and answers based on a set of over 10,000 news articles from CNN, with answers consisting in spans of text from the corresponding articles. We collect this dataset through a four-stage process designed to solicit exploratory questions that require reasoning. A thorough analysis confirms that NewsQA demands abilities beyond simple word matching and recognizing entailment. We measure human performance on the dataset and compare it to several strong neural models. The performance gap between humans and machines (25.3% F1) indicates that significant progress can be made on NewsQA through future research. The dataset is freely available at datasets.maluuba.com/NewsQA.",0

"We present a new approach for inference in Bayesian networks, which is mainly based on partial differentiation. According to this approach, one compiles a Bayesian network into a multivariate polynomial and then computes the partial derivatives of this polynomial with respect to each variable. We show that once such derivatives are made available, one can compute in constant-time answers to a large class of probabilistic queries, which are central to classical inference, parameter estimation, model validation and sensitivity analysis. We present a number of complexity results relating to the compilation of such polynomials and to the computation of their partial derivatives. We argue that the combined simplicity, comprehensiveness and computational complexity of the presented framework is unique among existing frameworks for inference in Bayesian networks.",0
"Stochastic algorithms are among the best for solving computationally hard search and reasoning problems. The runtime of such procedures is characterized by a random variable. Different algorithms give rise to different probability distributions. One can take advantage of such differences by combining several algorithms into a portfolio, and running them in parallel or interleaving them on a single processor. We provide a detailed evaluation of the portfolio approach on distributions of hard combinatorial search problems. We show under what conditions the protfolio approach can have a dramatic computational advantage over the best traditional methods.",0
"We introduce a framework for representing a variety of interesting problems as inference over the execution of probabilistic model programs. We represent a ""solution"" to such a problem as a guide program which runs alongside the model program and influences the model program's random choices, leading the model program to sample from a different distribution than from its priors. Ideally the guide program influences the model program to sample from the posteriors given the evidence. We show how the KL- divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution induced by the guided model program can be efficiently estimated (up to an additive constant) by sampling multiple executions of the guided model program. In addition, we show how to use the guide program as a proposal distribution in importance sampling to statistically prove lower bounds on the probability of the evidence and on the probability of a hypothesis and the evidence. We can use the quotient of these two bounds as an estimate of the conditional probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. We thus turn the inference problem into a heuristic search for better guide programs.",0
This paper describes a process for constructing situation-specific belief networks from a knowledge base of network fragments. A situation-specific network is a minimal query complete network constructed from a knowledge base in response to a query for the probability distribution on a set of target variables given evidence and context variables. We present definitions of query completeness and situation-specific networks. We describe conditions on the knowledge base that guarantee query completeness. The relationship of our work to earlier work on KBMC is also discussed.,0
"Gene and protein networks are very important to model complex large-scale systems in molecular biology. Inferring or reverseengineering such networks can be defined as the process of identifying gene/protein interactions from experimental data through computational analysis. However, this task is typically complicated by the enormously large scale of the unknowns in a rather small sample size. Furthermore, when the goal is to study causal relationships within the network, tools capable of overcoming the limitations of correlation networks are required. In this work, we make use of Bayesian Graphical Models to attach this problem and, specifically, we perform a comparative study of different state-of-the-art heuristics, analyzing their performance in inferring the structure of the Bayesian Network from breast cancer data.",0
"Cooperative pathfinding is a problem of finding a set of non-conflicting trajectories for a number of mobile agents. Its applications include planning for teams of mobile robots, such as autonomous aircrafts, cars, or underwater vehicles. The state-of-the-art algorithms for cooperative pathfinding typically rely on some heuristic forward-search pathfinding technique, where A* is often the algorithm of choice. Here, we propose MA-RRT*, a novel algorithm for multi-agent path planning that builds upon a recently proposed asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for finding single-agent shortest path called RRT*. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the algorithm and show that the sampling-based approach offers better scalability than the classical forward-search approach in relatively large, but sparse environments, which are typical in real-world applications such as multi-aircraft collision avoidance.",0
"A new probabilistic network construction system, DYNASTY, is proposed for diagnostic reasoning given variables whose probabilities change over time. Diagnostic reasoning is formulated as a sequential stochastic process, and is modeled using influence diagrams. Given a set O of observations, DYNASTY creates an influence diagram in order to devise the best action given O. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine if the best network has been created, given the uncertainty in network parameters and topology. DYNASTY uses an equivalence class approach to provide decision thresholds for the sensitivity analysis. This equivalence-class approach to diagnostic reasoning differentiates diagnoses only if the required actions are different. A set of network-topology updating algorithms are proposed for dynamically updating the network when necessary.",0
"In recent years, deep architectures have been used for transfer learning with state-of-the-art performance in many datasets. The properties of their features remain, however, largely unstudied under the transfer perspective. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of the resiliency of feature vectors extracted from deep models, with special focus on the trade-off between performance and compression rate. By introducing perturbations to image descriptions extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, we change their precision and number of dimensions, measuring how it affects the final score. We show that deep features are more robust to these disturbances when compared to classical approaches, achieving a compression rate of 98.4%, while losing only 0.88% of their original score for Pascal VOC 2007.",0
"Cold start problem in Collaborative Filtering can be solved by asking new users to rate a small seed set of representative items or by asking representative users to rate a new item. The question is how to build a seed set that can give enough preference information for making good recommendations. One of the most successful approaches, called Representative Based Matrix Factorization, is based on Maxvol algorithm. Unfortunately, this approach has one important limitation --- a seed set of a particular size requires a rating matrix factorization of fixed rank that should coincide with that size. This is not necessarily optimal in the general case. In the current paper, we introduce a fast algorithm for an analytical generalization of this approach that we call Rectangular Maxvol. It allows the rank of factorization to be lower than the required size of the seed set. Moreover, the paper includes the theoretical analysis of the method's error, the complexity analysis of the existing methods and the comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.",0
"Solving sequential decision making problems, such as text parsing, robotic control, and game playing, requires a combination of planning policies and generalisation of those plans. In this paper, we present Expert Iteration, a novel algorithm which decomposes the problem into separate planning and generalisation tasks. Planning new policies is performed by tree search, while a deep neural network generalises those plans. In contrast, standard Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms rely on a neural network not only to generalise plans, but to discover them too. We show that our method substantially outperforms Policy Gradients in the board game Hex, winning 84.4% of games against it when trained for equal time.",1
"In this paper, a novel architecture for a deep recurrent neural network, residual LSTM is introduced. A plain LSTM has an internal memory cell that can learn long term dependencies of sequential data. It also provides a temporal shortcut path to avoid vanishing or exploding gradients in the temporal domain. The proposed residual LSTM architecture provides an additional spatial shortcut path from lower layers for efficient training of deep networks with multiple LSTM layers. Compared with the previous work, highway LSTM, residual LSTM reuses the output projection matrix and the output gate of LSTM to control the spatial information flow instead of additional gate networks, which effectively reduces more than 10% of network parameters. An experiment for distant speech recognition on the AMI SDM corpus indicates that the performance of plain and highway LSTM networks degrades with increasing network depth. For example, 10-layer plain and highway LSTM networks showed 13.7% and 6.2% increase in WER over 3-layer baselines, respectively. On the contrary, 10-layer residual LSTM networks provided the lowest WER 41.0%, which corresponds to 3.3% and 2.8% WER reduction over 3-layer plain and highway LSTM networks, respectively. Training with both the IHM and SDM corpora, the residual LSTM architecture provided larger gain from increasing depth: a 10-layer residual LSTM showed 3.0% WER reduction over the corresponding 5-layer one.",0
"We consider a dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows and stochastic customers (DS-VRPTW), such that customers may request for services as vehicles have already started their tours. To solve this problem, the goal is to provide a decision rule for choosing, at each time step, the next action to perform in light of known requests and probabilistic knowledge on requests likelihood. We introduce a new decision rule, called Global Stochastic Assessment (GSA) rule for the DS-VRPTW, and we compare it with existing decision rules, such as MSA. In particular, we show that GSA fully integrates nonanticipativity constraints so that it leads to better decisions in our stochastic context. We describe a new heuristic approach for efficiently approximating our GSA rule. We introduce a new waiting strategy. Experiments on dynamic and stochastic benchmarks, which include instances of different degrees of dynamism, show that not only our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, but also enables to compute meaningful offline solutions to fully dynamic problems where absolutely no a priori customer request is provided.",0
"In order to meet usability requirements, most logic-based applications provide explanation facilities for reasoning services. This holds also for Description Logics, where research has focused on the explanation of both TBox reasoning and, more recently, query answering. Besides explaining the presence of a tuple in a query answer, it is important to explain also why a given tuple is missing. We address the latter problem for instance and conjunctive query answering over DL-Lite ontologies by adopting abductive reasoning; that is, we look for additions to the ABox that force a given tuple to be in the result. As reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation, and relevance and necessity of a given assertion for an explanation. We characterize the computational complexity of these problems for arbitrary, subset minimal, and cardinality minimal explanations.",0
"A phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationships among species. Internal nodes of the tree represent speciation events and leaf nodes correspond to species. A goal of phylogenetics is to combine such trees into larger trees, called supertrees, whilst respecting the relationships in the original trees. A rooted tree exhibits an ultrametric property; that is, for any three leaves of the tree it must be that one pair has a deeper most recent common ancestor than the other pairs, or that all three have the same most recent common ancestor. This inspires a constraint programming encoding for rooted trees. We present an efficient constraint that enforces the ultrametric property over a symmetric array of constrained integer variables, with the inevitable property that the lower bounds of any three variables are mutually supportive. We show that this allows an efficient constraint-based solution to the supertree construction problem. We demonstrate that the versatility of constraint programming can be exploited to allow solutions to variants of the supertree construction problem.",0
"Building a safety case is a common approach to make expert judgement explicit about safety of a system. The issue of confidence in such argumentation is still an open research field. Providing quantitative estimation of confidence is an interesting approach to manage complexity of arguments. This paper explores the main current approaches, and proposes a new model for quantitative confidence estimation based on Belief Theory for its definition, and on Bayesian Belief Networks for its propagation in safety case networks.",0
"Operation management problems (such as Production Planning and Scheduling) are represented and formulated as optimization models. The resolution of such optimization models leads to solutions which have to be operated in an organization. However, the conditions under which the optimal solution is obtained rarely correspond exactly to the conditions under which the solution will be operated in the organization.Therefore, in most practical contexts, the computed optimal solution is not anymore optimal under the conditions in which it is operated. Indeed, it can be ""far from optimal"" or even not feasible. For different reasons, we hadn't the possibility to completely re-optimize the existing solution or plan. As a consequence, it is necessary to look for ""repair solutions"", i.e., solutions that have a good behavior with respect to possible scenarios, or with respect to uncertainty of the parameters of the model. To tackle the problem, the computed solution should be such that it is possible to ""repair"" it through a local re-optimization guided by the user or through a limited change aiming at minimizing the impact of taking into consideration the scenarios.",0
MEASP is a multi-engine solver for ground ASP programs. It exploits algorithm selection techniques based on classification to select one among a set of out-of-the-box heterogeneous ASP solvers used as black-box engines. In this paper we report on (i) a new optimized implementation of MEASP; and (ii) an attempt of applying algorithm selection to non-ground programs. An experimental analysis reported in the paper shows that (i) the new implementation of \measp is substantially faster than the previous version; and (ii) the multi-engine recipe can be applied to the evaluation of non-ground programs with some benefits.,0
"Games have always been a popular test bed for artificial intelligence techniques. Game developers are always in constant search for techniques that can automatically create computer games minimizing the developer's task. In this work we present an evolutionary strategy based solution towards the automatic generation of two player board games. To guide the evolutionary process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a set of metrics. These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games with the existing popular board based games. Further to verify the entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network based controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an initial search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.",0
"In recent studies of political decision-making, apparently anomalous behavior has been observed on the part of voters, in which negative information about a candidate strengthens, rather than weakens, a prior positive opinion about the candidate. This behavior appears to run counter to rational models of decision making, and it is sometimes interpreted as evidence of non-rational ""motivated reasoning"". We consider scenarios in which this effect arises in a model of rational decision making which includes the possibility of deceptive information. In particular, we will consider a model in which there are two classes of voters, which we will call trusting voters and suspicious voters, and two types of information sources, which we will call unbiased sources and biased sources. In our model, new data about a candidate can be efficiently incorporated by a trusting voter, and anomalous updates are impossible; however, anomalous updates can be made by suspicious voters, if the information source mistakenly plans for an audience of trusting voters, and if the partisan goals of the information source are known by the suspicious voter to be ""opposite"" to his own. Our model is based on a formalism introduced by the artificial intelligence community called ""multi-agent influence diagrams"", which generalize Bayesian networks to settings involving multiple agents with distinct goals.",0
"We investigate the problem of learning the structure of a Markov network from data. It is shown that the structure of such networks can be described in terms of constraints which enables the use of existing solver technology with optimization capabilities to compute optimal networks starting from initial scores computed from the data. To achieve efficient encodings, we develop a novel characterization of Markov network structure using a balancing condition on the separators between cliques forming the network. The resulting translations into propositional satisfiability and its extensions such as maximum satisfiability, satisfiability modulo theories, and answer set programming, enable us to prove optimal certain network structures which have been previously found by stochastic search.",1
"Robots will eventually be part of every household. It is thus critical to enable algorithms to learn from and be guided by non-expert users. In this paper, we bring a human in the loop, and enable a human teacher to give feedback to a learning agent in the form of natural language. We argue that a descriptive sentence can provide a much stronger learning signal than a numeric reward in that it can easily point to where the mistakes are and how to correct them. We focus on the problem of image captioning in which the quality of the output can easily be judged by non-experts. We propose a hierarchical phrase-based captioning model trained with policy gradients, and design a feedback network that provides reward to the learner by conditioning on the human-provided feedback. We show that by exploiting descriptive feedback our model learns to perform better than when given independently written human captions.",1
"The role of T-cells within the immune system is to confirm and assess anomalous situations and then either respond to or tolerate the source of the effect. To illustrate how these mechanisms can be harnessed to solve real-world problems, we present the blueprint of a T-cell inspired algorithm for computer security worm detection. We show how the three central T-cell processes, namely T-cell maturation, differentiation and proliferation, naturally map into this domain and further illustrate how such an algorithm fits into a complete immune inspired computer security system and framework.",0
This paper presents a microkernel architecture for constraint programming organized around a number of small number of core functionalities and minimal interfaces.

"Value-of-information analyses provide a straightforward means for selecting the best next observation to make, and for determining whether it is better to gather additional information or to act immediately. Determining the next best test to perform, given a state of uncertainty about the world, requires a consideration of the value of making all possible sequences of observations. In practice, decision analysts and expert-system designers have avoided the intractability of exact computation of the value of information by relying on a myopic approximation. Myopic analyses are based on the assumption that only one additional test will be performed, even when there is an opportunity to make a large number of observations. We present a nonmyopic approximation for value of information that bypasses the traditional myopic analyses by exploiting the statistical properties of large samples.",0
"An approach to reasoning with default rules where the proportion of exceptions, or more generally the probability of encountering an exception, can be at least roughly assessed is presented. It is based on local uncertainty propagation rules which provide the best bracketing of a conditional probability of interest from the knowledge of the bracketing of some other conditional probabilities. A procedure that uses two such propagation rules repeatedly is proposed in order to estimate any simple conditional probability of interest from the available knowledge. The iterative procedure, that does not require independence assumptions, looks promising with respect to the linear programming method. Improved bounds for conditional probabilities are given when independence assumptions hold.",0
"The sociotechnological system is a system constituted of human individuals and their artifacts: technological artifacts, institutions, conceptual and representational systems, worldviews, knowledge systems, culture and the whole biosphere as a volutionary niche. In our view the sociotechnological system as a super-organism is shaped and determined both by the characteristics of the agents involved and the characteristics emergent in their interactions at multiple scales. Our approach to sociotechnological dynamics will maintain a balance between perspectives: the individual and the collective. Accordingly, we analyze dynamics of the Web as a sociotechnological system made of people, computers and digital artifacts (Web pages, databases, search engines, etc.). Making sense of the sociotechnological system while being part of it, is also a constant interplay between pragmatic and value based approaches. The first is focusing on the actualities of the system while the second highlights the observer's projections. In our attempt to model sociotechnological dynamics and envision its future, we take special care to make explicit our values as part of the analysis. In sociotechnological systems with a high degree of reflexivity (coupling between the perception of the system and the system's behavior), highlighting values is of critical importance. In this essay, we choose to see the future evolution of the web as facilitating a basic value, that is, continuous open-ended intelligence expansion. By that we mean that we see intelligence expansion as the determinant of the 'greater good' and 'well being' of both of individuals and collectives at all scales. Our working definition of intelligence here is the progressive process of sense-making of self, other, environment and universe. Intelligence expansion, therefore, means an increasing ability of sense-making.",0
"We apply genetic programming techniques to the `shepherding' problem, in which a group of one type of animal (sheep dogs) attempts to control the movements of a second group of animals (sheep) obeying flocking behavior. Our genetic programming algorithm evolves an expression tree that governs the movements of each dog. The operands of the tree are hand-selected features of the simulation environment that may allow the dogs to herd the sheep effectively. The algorithm uses tournament-style selection, crossover reproduction, and a point mutation. We find that the evolved solutions generalize well and outperform a (naive) human-designed algorithm.",0
"This paper extends recent work in interactive machine learning (IML) focused on effectively incorporating human feedback. We show how control and feedback signals complement each other in systems which model human reward. We demonstrate that simultaneously incorporating human control and feedback signals can improve interactive robotic systems' performance on a self-mirrored movement control task where an RL-agent controlled right arm attempts to match the preprogrammed movement pattern of the left arm. We illustrate the impact of varying human feedback parameters on task performance by investigating the probability of giving feedback on each time step and the likelihood of given feedback being correct. We further illustrate that varying the temporal decay with which the agent incorporates human feedback has a significant impact on task performance. We found that 'smearing' human feedback over time steps improves performance and we show varying the probability of feedback at each time step, and an increased likelihood of those feedbacks being 'correct' can impact agent performance. We conclude that understanding latent variables in human feedback is crucial for learning algorithms acting in human-machine interaction domains.",0
"This paper focuses on causal structure estimation from time series data in which measurements are obtained at a coarser timescale than the causal timescale of the underlying system. Previous work has shown that such sub-sampling can lead to significant errors about the system's causal structure if not properly taken into account. In this paper, we first consider the search for the system timescale causal structures that correspond to a given measurement timescale structure. We provide a constraint satisfaction procedure whose computational performance is several orders of magnitude better than previous approaches, and that has considerably broader applicability. We then consider finite sample data as input, and propose the first constraint optimization approach for recovering the system timescale causal structure. This algorithm optimally recovers from possible conflicts due to statistical errors. More generally, these advances allow for a robust and non-parametric estimation of system timescale causal structures from subsampled time series data.",0
"In this paper we introduce reactive multi-context systems (rMCSs), a framework for reactive reasoning in the presence of heterogeneous knowledge sources. In particular, we show how to integrate data streams into multi-context systems (MCSs) and how to model the dynamics of the systems, based on two types of bridge rules. We illustrate how several typical problems arising in the context of stream reasoning can be handled using our framework. Reasoning based on multiple knowledge sources that need to be integrated faces the problem of potential inconsistencies. We discuss various methods for handling inconsistencies, with a special focus on non-existence of equilibria. In particular, we show how methods developed for managed MCSs can be generalized to rMCSs. We also study the issue of nondeterminism in rMCSs. One way of avoiding nondeterminism is by applying an alternative, skeptical semantics. We show how such a semantics, called well-founded semantics, can be defined for rMCSs, and what the effect of using this semantics instead of the original one is. We investigate the complexity of various reasoning problems related to rMCSs. Finally, we discuss related work, with a special focus on two of the most relevant approaches w.r.t. stream reasoning, namely LARS and STARQL.",0
"We present Dynamic Epistemic Temporal Logic, a framework for reasoning about operations on multi-agent Kripke models that contain a designated temporal relation. These operations are natural extensions of the well-known ""action models"" from Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Our ""temporal action models"" may be used to define a number of informational actions that can modify the ""objective"" temporal structure of a model along with the agents' basic and higher-order knowledge and beliefs about this structure, including their beliefs about the time. In essence, this approach provides one way to extend the domain of action model-style operations from atemporal Kripke models to temporal Kripke models in a manner that allows actions to control the flow of time. We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models. We also study preservation of important epistemic-temporal properties of temporal Kripke models under temporal action model-induced operations, provide complete axiomatizations for two theories of temporal action models, and connect our approach with previous work on time in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.",0
This paper proposes a new method for solving Bayesian decision problems. The method consists of representing a Bayesian decision problem as a valuation-based system and applying a fusion algorithm for solving it. The fusion algorithm is a hybrid of local computational methods for computation of marginals of joint probability distributions and the local computational methods for discrete optimization problems.,0
"Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem; for example we may want to introduce new evidence to the model or perform updates to conditional dependencies. The goal of adaptive inference is to take advantage of what is preserved in the model and perform inference more rapidly than from scratch. In this paper, we describe techniques for adaptive inference on general graphs that support marginal computation and updates to the conditional probabilities and dependencies in logarithmic time. We give experimental results for an implementation of our algorithm, and demonstrate its potential performance benefit in the study of protein structure.",0
"Asynchronous Partial Overlay (APO) is a search algorithm that uses cooperative mediation to solve Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DisCSPs). The algorithm partitions the search into different subproblems of the DisCSP. The original proof of completeness of the APO algorithm is based on the growth of the size of the subproblems. The present paper demonstrates that this expected growth of subproblems does not occur in some situations, leading to a termination problem of the algorithm. The problematic parts in the APO algorithm that interfere with its completeness are identified and necessary modifications to the algorithm that fix these problematic parts are given. The resulting version of the algorithm, Complete Asynchronous Partial Overlay (CompAPO), ensures its completeness. Formal proofs for the soundness and completeness of CompAPO are given. A detailed performance evaluation of CompAPO comparing it to other DisCSP algorithms is presented, along with an extensive experimental evaluation of the algorithm's unique behavior. Additionally, an optimization version of the algorithm, CompOptAPO, is presented, discussed, and evaluated.",0
"Most exact algorithms for general partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) use a form of dynamic programming in which a piecewise-linear and convex representation of one value function is transformed into another. We examine variations of the ""incremental pruning"" method for solving this problem and compare them to earlier algorithms from theoretical and empirical perspectives. We find that incremental pruning is presently the most efficient exact method for solving POMDPs.",0
"Cooperative games model the allocation of profit from joint actions, following considerations such as stability and fairness. We propose the reliability extension of such games, where agents may fail to participate in the game. In the reliability extension, each agent only ""survives"" with a certain probability, and a coalition's value is the probability that its surviving members would be a winning coalition in the base game. We study prominent solution concepts in such games, showing how to approximate the Shapley value and how to compute the core in games with few agent types. We also show that applying the reliability extension may stabilize the game, making the core non-empty even when the base game has an empty core.",0
"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of {\em under-appreciated reward} regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its \mbox{resulting} reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring small modifications to an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. Our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Our algorithm successfully solves a benchmark multi-digit addition task and generalizes to long sequences. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.",1
"Document clustering as an unsupervised approach extensively used to navigate, filter, summarize and manage large collection of document repositories like the World Wide Web (WWW). Recently, focuses in this domain shifted from traditional vector based document similarity for clustering to suffix tree based document similarity, as it offers more semantic representation of the text present in the document. In this paper, we compare and contrast two recently introduced approaches to document clustering based on suffix tree data model. The first is an Efficient Phrase based document clustering, which extracts phrases from documents to form compact document representation and uses a similarity measure based on common suffix tree to cluster the documents. The second approach is a frequent word/word meaning sequence based document clustering, it similarly extracts the common word sequence from the document and uses the common sequence/ common word meaning sequence to perform the compact representation, and finally, it uses document clustering approach to cluster the compact documents. These algorithms are using agglomerative hierarchical document clustering to perform the actual clustering step, the difference in these approaches are mainly based on extraction of phrases, model representation as a compact document, and the similarity measures used for clustering. This paper investigates the computational aspect of the two algorithms, and the quality of results they produced.",0
"Many applications, e.g., Web service composition, complex system design, team formation, etc., rely on methods for identifying collections of objects or entities satisfying some functional requirement. Among the collections that satisfy the functional requirement, it is often necessary to identify one or more collections that are optimal with respect to user preferences over a set of attributes that describe the non-functional properties of the collection.",0
"An integrated GPS-GSM system is proposed to track vehicles using Google Earth application. The remote module has a GPS mounted on the moving vehicle to identify its current position, and to be transferred by GSM with other parameters acquired by the automobile's data port as an SMS to a recipient station. The received GPS coordinates are filtered using a Kalman filter to enhance the accuracy of measured position. After data processing, Google Earth application is used to view the current location and status of each vehicle. This goal of this system is to manage fleet, police automobiles distribution and car theft cautions.",0
"Based on Alan Turing's proposition on AI and computing machinery, which shaped Computing as we know it today, I argue that the new AI machine should understand linear algebra natively. In such a machine, a computing unit does not need to keep the legacy of a universal computing core. The data can be delivered to the computing units, and the results can be collected from them through Collective Streaming, reminiscent of Collective Communication in Supercomputing. There is no need for a deep memory hierarchy as in a GPU, nor a fine-grain mesh as in a systolic array.",0
"We consider a setting where an agent's uncertainty is represented by a set of probability measures, rather than a single measure. Measure-by-measure updating of such a set of measures upon acquiring new information is well-known to suffer from problems; agents are not always able to learn appropriately. To deal with these problems, we propose using weighted sets of probabilities: a representation where each measure is associated with a weight, which denotes its significance. We describe a natural approach to updating in such a situation and a natural approach to determining the weights. We then show how this representation can be used in decision-making, by modifying a standard approach to decision making -- minimizing expected regret -- to obtain minimax weighted expected regret (MWER). We provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by MWER both in the static and dynamic case.",0
"Usually, routing models in pedestrian dynamics assume that agents have fulfilled and global knowledge about the building's structure. However, they neglect the fact that pedestrians possess no or only parts of information about their position relative to final exits and possible routes leading to them. To get a more realistic description we introduce the systematics of gathering and using spatial knowledge. A new wayfinding model for pedestrian dynamics is proposed. The model defines for every pedestrian an individual knowledge representation implying inaccuracies and uncertainties. In addition, knowledge-driven search strategies are introduced. The presented concept is tested on a fictive example scenario.",0
"We propose a long-term memory design for artificial general intelligence based on Solomonoff's incremental machine learning methods. We use R5RS Scheme and its standard library with a few omissions as the reference machine. We introduce a Levin Search variant based on Stochastic Context Free Grammar together with four synergistic update algorithms that use the same grammar as a guiding probability distribution of programs. The update algorithms include adjusting production probabilities, re-using previous solutions, learning programming idioms and discovery of frequent subprograms. Experiments with two training sequences demonstrate that our approach to incremental learning is effective.",0
"Research on the so-called ""free-energy principle'' (FEP) in cognitive neuroscience is becoming increasingly high-profile. To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known.",0
"The rigorous theoretical analyses of algorithms for exact 3-satisfiability (X3SAT) have been proposed in the literature. As we know, previous algorithms for solving X3SAT have been analyzed only regarding the number of variables as the parameter. However, the time complexity for solving X3SAT instances depends not only on the number of variables, but also on the number of clauses. Therefore, it is significant to exploit the time complexity from the other point of view, i.e. the number of clauses. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving X3SAT with rigorous complexity analyses using the number of clauses as the parameter. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain the new worst-case upper bounds O(1.15855m), where m is the number of clauses.",0
"This paper relates the well-known formalism of Linear Temporal Logic with the logic of propositional schemata introduced by the authors. We prove that LTL is equivalent to a particular class of schemata in the sense that polynomial-time translation algorithms exist from one logic to the other. Not only does this result shed new light on the expressive power of propositional schemata, but it also entails the new result that the satisfiability of the considered class of schemata is PSPACE-complete. We informally compare the resulting proof procedures for each logic (opposing the direct approaches to the translation-based ones). The encoding from schemata to LTL makes the Wolper procedure for LTL very close to the standard tableaux procedure for schemata. The reverse encoding surprisingly makes the latter procedure very close to the one-pass Schwendimann algorithm for LTL.",0
"A wide variety of problems in machine learning, including exemplar clustering, document summarization, and sensor placement, can be cast as constrained submodular maximization problems. Unfortunately, the resulting submodular optimization problems are often too large to be solved on a single machine. We develop a simple distributed algorithm that is embarrassingly parallel and it achieves provable, constant factor, worst-case approximation guarantees. In our experiments, we demonstrate its efficiency in large problems with different kinds of constraints with objective values always close to what is achievable in the centralized setting.",1
"Recent interest in the use of $L_1$ regularization in the use of value function approximation includes Petrik et al.'s introduction of $L_1$-Regularized Approximate Linear Programming (RALP). RALP is unique among $L_1$-regularized approaches in that it approximates the optimal value function using off-policy samples. Additionally, it produces policies which outperform those of previous methods, such as LSPI. RALP's value function approximation quality is affected heavily by the choice of state-relevance weights in the objective function of the linear program, and by the distribution from which samples are drawn; however, there has been no discussion of these considerations in the previous literature. In this paper, we discuss and explain the effects of choices in the state-relevance weights and sampling distribution on approximation quality, using both theoretical and experimental illustrations. The results provide insight not only onto these effects, but also provide intuition into the types of MDPs which are especially well suited for approximation with RALP.",1
"A popular current research trend deals with expanding the Monte-Carlo tree search sampling methodologies to the environments with uncertainty and incomplete information. Recently a finite population version of Geiringer theorem with nonhomologous recombination has been adopted to the setting of Monte-Carlo tree search to cope with randomness and incomplete information by exploiting the entrinsic similarities within the state space of the problem. The only limitation of the new theorem is that the similarity relation was assumed to be an equivalence relation on the set of states. In the current paper we lift this ""curtain of limitation"" by allowing the similarity relation to be modeled in terms of an arbitrary set cover of the set of state-action pairs.",0
"We report on the phase transition of finding a complete subgraph, of specified dimensions, in a bipartite graph. Finding a complete subgraph in a bipartite graph is a problem that has growing attention in several domains, including bioinformatics, social network analysis and domain clustering. A key step for a successful phase transition study is identifying a suitable order parameter, when none is known. To this purpose, we have applied a decision tree classifier to real-world instances of this problem, in order to understand what problem features separate an instance that is hard to solve from those that is not. We have successfully identified one such order parameter and with it the phase transition of finding a complete bipartite subgraph of specified dimensions. Our phase transition study shows an easy-to-hard-to-easy-to-hard-to-easy pattern. Further, our results indicate that the hardest instances are in a region where it is more likely that the corresponding bipartite graph will have a complete subgraph of specified dimensions, a positive answer. By contrast, instances with a negative answer are more likely to appear in a region where the computational cost is negligible. This behaviour is remarkably similar for problems of a number of different sizes.",0
"Non-stationary domains, that change in unpredicted ways, are a challenge for agents searching for optimal policies in sequential decision-making problems. This paper presents a combination of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with Answer Set Programming (ASP), named {\em Online ASP for MDP} (oASP(MDP)), which is a method capable of constructing the set of domain states while the agent interacts with a changing environment. oASP(MDP) updates previously obtained policies, learnt by means of Reinforcement Learning (RL), using rules that represent the domain changes observed by the agent. These rules represent a set of domain constraints that are processed as ASP programs reducing the search space. Results show that oASP(MDP) is capable of finding solutions for problems in non-stationary domains without interfering with the action-value function approximation process.",0
This paper proposes a design for a system to generate constraint solvers that are specialised for specific problem models. It describes the design in detail and gives preliminary experimental results showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.,0
"Image captioning is a challenging problem owing to the complexity in understanding the image content and diverse ways of describing it in natural language. Recent advances in deep neural networks have substantially improved the performance of this task. Most state-of-the-art approaches follow an encoder-decoder framework, which generates captions using a sequential recurrent prediction model. However, in this paper, we introduce a novel decision-making framework for image captioning. We utilize a ""policy network"" and a ""value network"" to collaboratively generate captions. The policy network serves as a local guidance by providing the confidence of predicting the next word according to the current state. Additionally, the value network serves as a global and lookahead guidance by evaluating all possible extensions of the current state. In essence, it adjusts the goal of predicting the correct words towards the goal of generating captions similar to the ground truth captions. We train both networks using an actor-critic reinforcement learning model, with a novel reward defined by visual-semantic embedding. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Microsoft COCO dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across different evaluation metrics.",0
"We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actor-critic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.",1
"Encoding finite linear CSPs as Boolean formulas and solving them by using modern SAT solvers has proven to be highly effective, as exemplified by the award-winning sugar system. We here develop an alternative approach based on ASP. This allows us to use first-order encodings providing us with a high degree of flexibility for easy experimentation with different implementations. The resulting system aspartame re-uses parts of sugar for parsing and normalizing CSPs. The obtained set of facts is then combined with an ASP encoding that can be grounded and solved by off-the-shelf ASP systems. We establish the competitiveness of our approach by empirically contrasting aspartame and sugar.",0
"The problem of modeling and predicting spatiotemporal traffic phenomena over an urban road network is important to many traffic applications such as detecting and forecasting congestion hotspots. This paper presents a decentralized data fusion and active sensing (D2FAS) algorithm for mobile sensors to actively explore the road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. We analyze the time and communication complexity of D2FAS and demonstrate that it can scale well with a large number of observations and sensors. We provide a theoretical guarantee on its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the Gaussian process (GP) model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm), thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction. We also theoretically guarantee its active sensing performance that improves under various practical environmental conditions. Empirical evaluation on real-world urban road network data shows that our D2FAS algorithm is significantly more time-efficient and scalable than state-of-the-art centralized algorithms while achieving comparable predictive performance.",0
"Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (QSTR) is concerned with symbolic knowledge representation, typically over infinite domains. The motivations for employing QSTR techniques range from exploiting computational properties that allow efficient reasoning to capture human cognitive concepts in a computational framework. The notion of a qualitative calculus is one of the most prominent QSTR formalisms. This article presents the first overview of all qualitative calculi developed to date and their computational properties, together with generalized definitions of the fundamental concepts and methods, which now encompass all existing calculi. Moreover, we provide a classification of calculi according to their algebraic properties.",0
"This paper refers to the syntactic analysis of phrases in Romanian, as an important process of natural language processing. We will suggest a real-time solution, based on the idea of using some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category; and some specific endings of some parts of sentence. Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language, where some prepositions, adverbs or some specific endings can provide a lot of information about the structure of a complex sentence. Such characteristics can be found in other languages, too, such as French. Using a special grammar, we developed a system (DIASEXP) that can perform a dialogue in natural language with assertive and interogative sentences about a ""story"" (a set of sentences describing some events from the real life).",0
"This paper investigates the validity of Kleinberg's axioms for clustering functions with respect to the quite popular clustering algorithm called $k$-means. While Kleinberg's axioms have been discussed heavily in the past, we concentrate here on the case predominantly relevant for $k$-means algorithm, that is behavior embedded in Euclidean space. We point at some contradictions and counter intuitiveness aspects of this axiomatic set within $\mathbb{R}^m$ that were evidently not discussed so far. Our results suggest that apparently without defining clearly what kind of clusters we expect we will not be able to construct a valid axiomatic system. In particular we look at the shape and the gaps between the clusters. Finally we demonstrate that there exist several ways to reconcile the formulation of the axioms with their intended meaning and that under this reformulation the axioms stop to be contradictory and the real-world $k$-means algorithm conforms to this axiomatic system.",0
"Ambiguity or uncertainty is a pervasive element of many real world decision making processes. Variation in decisions is a norm in this situation when the same problem is posed to different subjects. Psychological and metaphysical research had proven that decision making by human is subjective. It is influenced by many factors such as experience, age, background, etc. Scene understanding is one of the computer vision problems that fall into this category. Conventional methods relax this problem by assuming scene images are mutually exclusive; and therefore, focus on developing different approaches to perform the binary classification tasks. In this paper, we show that scene images are non-mutually exclusive, and propose the Fuzzy Qualitative Rank Classifier (FQRC) to tackle the aforementioned problems. The proposed FQRC provides a ranking interpretation instead of binary decision. Evaluations in term of qualitative and quantitative using large numbers and challenging public scene datasets have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method in modeling the non-mutually exclusive scene images.",0
"We present a method for calculation of myopic value of information in influence diagrams (Howard &amp; Matheson, 1981) based on the strong junction tree framework (Jensen, Jensen &amp; Dittmer, 1994). The difference in instantiation order in the influence diagrams is reflected in the corresponding junction trees by the order in which the chance nodes are marginalized. This order of marginalization can be changed by table expansion and in effect the same junction tree with expanded tables may be used for calculating the expected utility for scenarios with different instantiation order. We also compare our method to the classic method of modeling different instantiation orders in the same influence diagram.",0
"Graph partitioning, a well studied problem of parallel computing has many applications in diversified fields such as distributed computing, social network analysis, data mining and many other domains. In this paper, we introduce FGPGA, an efficient genetic approach for producing feasible graph partitions. Our method takes into account the heterogeneity and capacity constraints of the partitions to ensure balanced partitioning. Such approach has various applications in mobile cloud computing that include feasible deployment of software applications on the more resourceful infrastructure in the cloud instead of mobile hand set. Our proposed approach is light weight and hence suitable for use in cloud architecture. We ensure feasibility of the partitions generated by not allowing over-sized partitions to be generated during the initialization and search. Our proposed method tested on standard benchmark datasets significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality of partitions and feasibility of the solutions.",0
"In this paper, we introduce a generalized value iteration network (GVIN), which is an end-to-end neural network planning module. GVIN emulates the value iteration algorithm by using a novel graph convolution operator, which enables GVIN to learn and plan on irregular spatial graphs. We propose three novel differentiable kernels as graph convolution operators and show that the embedding based kernel achieves the best performance. We further propose episodic Q-learning, an improvement upon traditional n-step Q-learning that stabilizes training for networks that contain a planning module. Lastly, we evaluate GVIN on planning problems in 2D mazes, irregular graphs, and real-world street networks, showing that GVIN generalizes well for both arbitrary graphs and unseen graphs of larger scale and outperforms a naive generalization of VIN (discretizing a spatial graph into a 2D image).",0
"Planning actions using learned and differentiable forward models of the world is a general approach which has a number of desirable properties, including improved sample complexity over model-free RL methods, reuse of learned models across different tasks, and the ability to perform efficient gradient-based optimization in continuous action spaces. However, this approach does not apply straightforwardly when the action space is discrete, which may have limited its adoption. In this work, we introduce two discrete planning tasks inspired by existing question-answering datasets and show that it is in fact possible to effectively perform planning via backprop in discrete action spaces using two simple yet principled modifications. Our experiments show that this approach can significantly outperform model-free RL based methods and supervised imitation learners.",0
"Many ubiquitous computing projects have addressed health and wellness behaviors such as healthy eating. Healthy meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning people's food preferences and making healthy recommendations that appeal to their palate is challenging. Existing approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized healthy meal recommender system designed to meet individuals' health goals, dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Marrying ideas from user preference learning and healthy eating promotion, Yum-me enables a simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via an image-based online learning framework, and projects the learned profile into the domain of healthy food options to find ones that will appeal to the user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me, and further discuss the most critical component of it: FoodDist, a state-of-the-art food image analysis model. We demonstrate FoodDist's superior performance through careful benchmarking, and discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. We validate the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a 60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance rate by 42.63% over the traditional food preference survey.",0
"Online learning is becoming increasingly popular for training on large datasets. However, the sequential nature of online learning requires a centralized learner to store data and update parameters. In this paper, we consider a fully decentralized setting, cooperative autonomous online learning, with a distributed data source. The learners perform learning with local parameters while periodically communicating with a small subset of neighbors to exchange information. We define the regret in terms of an implicit aggregated parameter of the learners for such a setting and prove regret bounds similar to the classical sequential online learning.",0
"The first ever human vs. computer no-limit Texas hold 'em competition took place from April 24-May 8, 2015 at River's Casino in Pittsburgh, PA. In this article I present my thoughts on the competition design, agent architecture, and lessons learned.",0
"Markov Logic Networks (MLN) and Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) are widely applied formalisms in Statistical Relational Learning, an emerging area in Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with combining logical and statistical AI. Despite their resemblance, the relationship has not been formally stated. In this paper, we describe the precise semantic relationship between them from a logical perspective. This is facilitated by first extending fuzzy logic to allow weights, which can be also viewed as a generalization of PSL, and then relate that generalization to MLN. We observe that the relationship between PSL and MLN is analogous to the known relationship between fuzzy logic and Boolean logic, and furthermore the weight scheme of PSL is essentially a generalization of the weight scheme of MLN for the many-valued setting.",0
"The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm utilizes a dynamical system, i.e., a reservoir, and a linear classifier, i.e., a read-out layer, to process data from sequential classification tasks. In this paper the usage of Cellular Automata (CA) as a reservoir is investigated. The use of CA in RC has been showing promising results. In this paper, selected state-of-the-art experiments are reproduced. It is shown that some CA-rules perform better than others, and the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA reservoir itself. In addition, the usage of parallel loosely coupled CA-reservoirs, where each reservoir has a different CA-rule, is investigated. The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable insights in CA reservoir design. The results herein show that some rules do not work well together, while other combinations work remarkably well. This suggests that non-uniform CA could represent a powerful tool for novel CA reservoir implementations.",0
"Novel research in the field of Linked Data focuses on the problem of entity summarization. This field addresses the problem of ranking features according to their importance for the task of identifying a particular entity. Next to a more human friendly presentation, these summarizations can play a central role for semantic search engines and semantic recommender systems. In current approaches, it has been tried to apply entity summarization based on patterns that are inherent to the regarded data.",0
"We propose a formal framework for intelligent systems which can reason about scientific domains, in particular about the carcinogenicity of chemicals, and we study its properties. Our framework is grounded in a philosophy of scientific enquiry and discourse, and uses a model of dialectical argumentation. The formalism enables representation of scientific uncertainty and conflict in a manner suitable for qualitative reasoning about the domain.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established formalism for nonmonotonic reasoning. An ASP program can have no answer set due to cyclic default negation. In this case, it is not possible to draw any conclusion, even if this is not intended. Recently, several paracoherent semantics have been proposed that address this issue, and several potential applications for these semantics have been identified. However, paracoherent semantics have essentially been inapplicable in practice, due to the lack of efficient algorithms and implementations. In this paper, this lack is addressed, and several different algorithms to compute semi-stable and semi-equilibrium models are proposed and implemented into an answer set solving framework. An empirical performance comparison among the new algorithms on benchmarks from ASP competitions is given as well.",1
"Ontology Matching aims to find a set of semantic correspondences, called an alignment, between related ontologies. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in efficient and effective matching methods for large ontologies. However, most of the alignments produced for large ontologies are logically incoherent. It was only recently that the use of repair techniques to improve the quality of ontology alignments has been explored. In this paper we present a novel technique for detecting incoherent concepts based on ontology modularization, and a new repair algorithm that minimizes the incoherence of the resulting alignment and the number of matches removed from the input alignment. An implementation was done as part of a lightweight version of AgreementMaker system, a successful ontology matching platform, and evaluated using a set of four benchmark biomedical ontology matching tasks. Our results show that our implementation is efficient and produces better alignments with respect to their coherence and f-measure than the state of the art repairing tools. They also show that our implementation is a better alternative for producing coherent silver standard alignments.",0
"We present an initial version of Regular Boardgames general game description language. This stands as an extension of Simplified Boardgames language. Our language is designed to be able to express the rules of a majority of popular boardgames including the complex rules such as promotions, castling, en passant, jump captures, liberty captures, and obligatory moves. The language describes all the above through one consistent general mechanism based on regular expressions, without using exceptions or ad hoc rules.",0
"We present an image-conditional image generation model. The model transfers an input domain to a target domain in semantic level, and generates the target image in pixel level. To generate realistic target images, we employ the real/fake-discriminator in Generative Adversarial Nets, but also introduce a novel domain-discriminator to make the generated image relevant to the input image. We verify our model through a challenging task of generating a piece of clothing from an input image of a dressed person. We present a high quality clothing dataset containing the two domains, and succeed in demonstrating decent results.",0
"Gaussian processes are rich distributions over functions, which provide a Bayesian nonparametric approach to smoothing and interpolation. We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that we can reconstruct standard covariances within our framework.",1
"One of the key challenges in electronic government (e-government) is the development of systems that can be easily integrated and interoperated to provide seamless services delivery to citizens. In recent years, Semantic Web technologies based on ontology have emerged as promising solutions to the above engineering problems. However, current research practicing semantic development in e-government does not focus on the application of available methodologies and platforms for developing government domain ontologies. Furthermore, only a few of these researches provide detailed guidelines for developing semantic ontology models from a government service domain. This research presents a case study combining an ontology building methodology and two state-of-the-art Semantic Web platforms namely Protege and Java Jena ontology API for semantic ontology development in e-government. Firstly, a framework adopted from the Uschold and King ontology building methodology is employed to build a domain ontology describing the semantic content of a government service domain. Thereafter, UML is used to semi-formally represent the domain ontology. Finally, Protege and Jena API are employed to create the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) representations of the domain ontology respectively to enable its computer processing. The study aims at: (1) providing e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world with detailed guidelines for practicing semantic content development in their e-government projects and (2), strengthening the adoption of semantic technologies in e-government. The study would also be of interest to novice Semantic Web developers who might used it as a starting point for further investigations.",0
"We study the inverse power index problem for weighted voting games: the problem of finding a weighted voting game in which the power of the players is as close as possible to a certain target distribution. Our goal is to find algorithms that solve this problem exactly. Thereto, we study various subclasses of simple games, and their associated representation methods. We survey algorithms and impossibility results for the synthesis problem, i.e., converting a representation of a simple game into another representation.",0
"This paper extends the reinforcement learning ideas into the multi-agents system, which is far more complicated than the previously studied single-agent system. We studied two different multi-agents systems. One is the fully-connected neural network consists of multiple single neurons. Another one is the simplified mechanical arm system which is controlled by multiple neurons. We suppose that each neuron is like an agent and it can do Gibbs sampling of the posterior probability of stimulus features. The policy is optimized in a way that the cumulative global rewards are maximized. The algorithm for the second system is based on the same idea but we incorporate the physics model into the constraints. The simulation results show that for the first system our algorithm converges well. For the second system it does not converge well in a reasonable simulation time length. In summary, we took the initial endeavor to study the reinforcement learning for multi-agents system. The computational complexity is always an issue and significant amount of works have to be done in order to better understand the problem.",0
"This paper develops automated testing and debugging techniques for answer set solver development. We describe a flexible grammar-based black-box ASP fuzz testing tool which is able to reveal various defects such as unsound and incomplete behavior, i.e. invalid answer sets and inability to find existing solutions, in state-of-the-art answer set solver implementations. Moreover, we develop delta debugging techniques for shrinking failure-inducing inputs on which solvers exhibit defective behavior. In particular, we develop a delta debugging algorithm in the context of answer set solving, and evaluate two different elimination strategies for the algorithm.",0
"Stacked generalization is a general method of using a high-level model to combine lower-level models to achieve greater predictive accuracy. In this paper we address two crucial issues which have been considered to be a `black art' in classification tasks ever since the introduction of stacked generalization in 1992 by Wolpert: the type of generalizer that is suitable to derive the higher-level model, and the kind of attributes that should be used as its input. We find that best results are obtained when the higher-level model combines the confidence (and not just the predictions) of the lower-level ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of stacked generalization for combining three different types of learning algorithms for classification tasks. We also compare the performance of stacked generalization with majority vote and published results of arcing and bagging.",0
"This paper describes three variants of a counterexample guided inductive optimization (CEGIO) approach based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. In particular, CEGIO relies on iterative executions to constrain a verification procedure, in order to perform inductive generalization, based on counterexamples extracted from SMT solvers. CEGIO is able to successfully optimize a wide range of functions, including non-linear and non-convex optimization problems based on SMT solvers, in which data provided by counterexamples are employed to guide the verification engine, thus reducing the optimization domain. The present algorithms are evaluated using a large set of benchmarks typically employed for evaluating optimization techniques. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which find the optimal solution in all evaluated benchmarks, while traditional techniques are usually trapped by local minima.",0
"In earlier work, we introduced flexible inference and decision-theoretic metareasoning to address the intractability of normative inference. Here, rather than pursuing the task of computing beliefs and actions with decision models composed of distinctions about uncertain events, we examine methods for inferring beliefs about mathematical truth before an automated theorem prover completes a proof. We employ a Bayesian analysis to update belief in truth, given theorem-proving progress, and show how decision-theoretic methods can be used to determine the value of continuing to deliberate versus taking immediate action in time-critical situations.",0
"In this paper we present Gelisp, a new library to represent musical Constraint Satisfaction Problems and search strategies intuitively. Gelisp has two interfaces, a command-line one for Common Lisp and a graphical one for OpenMusic. Using Gelisp, we solved a problem of automatic music generation proposed by composer Michael Jarrell and we found solutions for the All-interval series.",0
"This paper presents the first framework for integrating procedural knowledge, or ""know-how"", into the Linked Data Cloud. Know-how available on the Web, such as step-by-step instructions, is largely unstructured and isolated from other sources of online knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we propose extending to procedural knowledge the benefits that Linked Data has already brought to representing, retrieving and reusing declarative knowledge. We describe a framework for representing generic know-how as Linked Data and for automatically acquiring this representation from existing resources on the Web. This system also allows the automatic generation of links between different know-how resources, and between those resources and other online knowledge bases, such as DBpedia. We discuss the results of applying this framework to a real-world scenario and we show how it outperforms existing manual community-driven integration efforts.",0
"Lin and Zhaos theorem on loop formulas states that in the propositional case the stable model semantics of a logic program can be completely characterized by propositional loop formulas, but this result does not fully carry over to the first-order case. We investigate the precise relationship between the first-order stable model semantics and first-order loop formulas, and study conditions under which the former can be represented by the latter. In order to facilitate the comparison, we extend the definition of a first-order loop formula which was limited to a nondisjunctive program, to a disjunctive program and to an arbitrary first-order theory. Based on the studied relationship we extend the syntax of a logic program with explicit quantifiers, which allows us to do reasoning involving non-Herbrand stable models using first-order reasoners. Such programs can be viewed as a special class of first-order theories under the stable model semantics, which yields more succinct loop formulas than the general language due to their restricted syntax.",0
"Recently, several large-scale RDF knowledge bases have been built and applied in many knowledge-based applications. To further increase the number of facts in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from large-scale knowledge bases becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases. RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.",0
"Artifact-centric process models aim to describe complex processes as a collection of interacting artifacts. Recent development in process mining allow for the discovery of such models. However, the focus is often on the representation of the individual artifacts rather than their interactions. Based on event data we can automatically discover composite state machines representing artifact-centric processes. Moreover, we provide ways of visualizing and quantifying interactions among different artifacts. For example, we are able to highlight strongly correlated behaviours in different artifacts. The approach has been fully implemented as a ProM plug-in; the CSM Miner provides an interactive artifact-centric process discovery tool focussing on interactions. The approach has been evaluated using real life data sets, including the personal loan and overdraft process of a Dutch financial institution.",0
"We present an algorithm for arc reversal in Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables, and consider some of its advantages, especially for the simulation of dynamic probabilistic networks. In particular, the method allows one to produce CPTs for nodes involved in the reversal that exploit regularities in the conditional distributions. We argue that this approach alleviates some of the overhead associated with arc reversal, plays an important role in evidence integration and can be used to restrict sampling of variables in DPNs. We also provide an algorithm that detects the dynamic irrelevance of state variables in forward simulation. This algorithm exploits the structured CPTs in a reversed network to determine, in a time-independent fashion, the conditions under which a variable does or does not need to be sampled.",0
"The Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem is the problem of finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clauses of a given Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Many exact solvers for MaxSAT have been developed during recent years, and many of them were presented in the well-known SAT conference. Algorithms for MaxSAT generally fall into two categories: (1) branch and bound algorithms and (2) algorithms that use successive calls to a SAT solver (SAT- based), which this paper in on. In practical problems, SAT-based algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. This paper provides an experimental investigation to compare the performance of recent SAT-based and branch and bound algorithms on the benchmarks of the MaxSAT Evaluations.",0
"Planning for distributed agents with partial state information is considered from a decision- theoretic perspective. We describe generalizations of both the MDP and POMDP models that allow for decentralized control. For even a small number of agents, the finite-horizon problems corresponding to both of our models are complete for nondeterministic exponential time. These complexity results illustrate a fundamental difference between centralized and decentralized control of Markov processes. In contrast to the MDP and POMDP problems, the problems we consider provably do not admit polynomial-time algorithms and most likely require doubly exponential time to solve in the worst case. We have thus provided mathematical evidence corresponding to the intuition that decentralized planning problems cannot easily be reduced to centralized problems and solved exactly using established techniques.",0
"Link prediction, the problem of identifying missing links among a set of inter-related data entities, is a popular field of research due to its application to graph-like domains. Producing consistent evaluations of the performance of the many link prediction algorithms being proposed can be challenging due to variable graph properties, such as size and density. In this paper we first discuss traditional data mining solutions which are applicable to link prediction evaluation, arguing about their capacity for producing faithful and useful evaluations. We also introduce an innovative modification to a traditional evaluation methodology with the goal of adapting it to the problem of evaluating link prediction algorithms when applied to large graphs, by tackling the problem of class imbalance. We empirically evaluate the proposed methodology and, building on these findings, make a case for its importance on the evaluation of large-scale graph processing.",0
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) are two popular techniques for modeling sequential data. Inference algorithms designed over CRFs and HMMs allow estimation of the state sequence given the observations. In several applications, estimation of the state sequence is not the end goal; instead the goal is to compute some function of it. In such scenarios, estimating the state sequence by conventional inference techniques, followed by computing the functional mapping from the estimate is not necessarily optimal. A more formal approach is to directly infer the final outcome from the observations. In particular, we consider the specific instantiation of the problem where the goal is to find the state trajectories without exact transition points and derive a novel polynomial time inference algorithm that outperforms vanilla inference techniques. We show that this particular problem arises commonly in many disparate applications and present experiments on three of them: (1) Toy robot tracking; (2) Single stroke character recognition; (3) Handwritten word recognition.",0
"This paper presents a tentative outline for the construction of an artificial, generally intelligent system (AGI). It is argued that building a general data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity threshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby compressing the data increasingly at every iteration.",0
"New proof assistant developments often involve concepts similar to already formalized ones. When proving their properties, a human can often take inspiration from the existing formalized proofs available in other provers or libraries. In this paper we propose and evaluate a number of methods, which strengthen proof automation by learning from proof libraries of different provers. Certain conjectures can be proved directly from the dependencies induced by similar proofs in the other library. Even if exact correspondences are not found, learning-reasoning systems can make use of the association between proved theorems and their characteristics to predict the relevant premises. Such external help can be further combined with internal advice. We evaluate the proposed knowledge-sharing methods by reproving the HOL Light and HOL4 standard libraries. The learning-reasoning system HOL(y)Hammer, whose single best strategy could automatically find proofs for 30% of the HOL Light problems, can prove 40% with the knowledge from HOL4.",0
"Real Time Strategy (RTS) games provide complex domain to test the latest artificial intelligence (AI) research. In much of the literature, AI systems have been limited to playing one game. Although, this specialization has resulted in stronger AI gaming systems it does not address the key concerns of AI researcher. AI researchers seek the development of AI agents that can autonomously interpret learn, and apply new knowledge. To achieve human level performance, current AI systems rely on game specific knowledge of an expert. The paper presents the full RTS language in hopes of shifting the current research focus to the development of general RTS agents. General RTS agents are AI gaming systems that can play any RTS games, defined in the RTS language. This prevents game specific knowledge from being hard coded into the system, thereby facilitating research that addresses the fundamental concerns of artificial intelligence.",0
"The goal of this paper is to present a scenario-based serious-game simulation platform that supports social training and coaching in the context of job interviews. It relies on the use of virtual agents that are capable to react in real time to a human interlocutor's expressed affects, through the detection of non-verbal cues, their analysis and their interpretation in the context of the job interview situation. Our system build affective states and beliefs about a real user in interaction with a virtual character. To this end, we rely on real-time social cue recognition, communicative performance computation and affective computation/decision from the recruiter. Indeed, building a credible job interview simulation with a reactive virtual agent requires to perceive the applicant in order to understand its reactions and adapt to his performance.",0
"In this paper, a novel multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology is presented for assessing and prioritizing medical tourism destinations in uncertain environment. A systematic evaluation and assessment method is proposed by integrating rough number based AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and rough number based MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison). Rough number is used to aggregate individual judgments and preferences to deal with vagueness in decision making due to limited data. Rough AHP analyzes the relative importance of criteria based on their preferences given by experts. Rough MABAC evaluates the alternative sites based on the criteria weights. The proposed methodology is explained through a case study considering different cities for healthcare service in India. The validity of the obtained ranking for the given decision making problem is established by testing criteria proposed by Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008) along with further analysis and discussion.",0
"A semantic segmentation algorithm must assign a label to every pixel in an image. Recently, semantic segmentation of RGB imagery has advanced significantly due to deep learning. Because creating datasets for semantic segmentation is laborious, these datasets tend to be significantly smaller than object recognition datasets. This makes it difficult to directly train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation, because it will be prone to overfitting. To cope with this, deep learning models typically use convolutional neural networks pre-trained on large-scale image classification datasets, which are then fine-tuned for semantic segmentation. For non-RGB imagery, this is currently not possible because large-scale labeled non-RGB datasets do not exist. In this paper, we developed two deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of multispectral remote sensing imagery. Prior to training on the target dataset, we initialize the networks with large amounts of synthetic multispectral imagery. We show that this significantly improves results on real-world remote sensing imagery, and we establish a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Hamlin Beach State Park Dataset.",0
"Belief revision is an operation that aims at modifying old beliefs so that they become consistent with new ones. The issue of belief revision has been studied in various formalisms, in particular, in qualitative algebras (QAs) in which the result is a disjunction of belief bases that is not necessarily representable in a QA. This motivates the study of belief revision in formalisms extending QAs, namely, their propositional closures: in such a closure, the result of belief revision belongs to the formalism. Moreover, this makes it possible to define a contraction operator thanks to the Harper identity. Belief revision in the propositional closure of QAs is studied, an algorithm for a family of revision operators is designed, and an open-source implementation is made freely available on the web. (This is the extended version of an article originally presented at the 14th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.)",0
"We describe a general approach to optimization which we term `Squeaky Wheel' Optimization (SWO). In SWO, a greedy algorithm is used to construct a solution which is then analyzed to find the trouble spots, i.e., those elements, that, if improved, are likely to improve the objective function score. The results of the analysis are used to generate new priorities that determine the order in which the greedy algorithm constructs the next solution. This Construct/Analyze/Prioritize cycle continues until some limit is reached, or an acceptable solution is found. SWO can be viewed as operating on two search spaces: solutions and prioritizations. Successive solutions are only indirectly related, via the re-prioritization that results from analyzing the prior solution. Similarly, successive prioritizations are generated by constructing and analyzing solutions. This `coupled search' has some interesting properties, which we discuss. We report encouraging experimental results on two domains, scheduling problems that arise in fiber-optic cable manufacturing, and graph coloring problems. The fact that these domains are very different supports our claim that SWO is a general technique for optimization.",0
"This is the first study on crowdsourcing Pareto-optimal object finding, which has applications in public opinion collection, group decision making, and information exploration. Departing from prior studies on crowdsourcing skyline and ranking queries, it considers the case where objects do not have explicit attributes and preference relations on objects are strict partial orders. The partial orders are derived by aggregating crowdsourcers' responses to pairwise comparison questions. The goal is to find all Pareto-optimal objects by the fewest possible questions. It employs an iterative question-selection framework. Guided by the principle of eagerly identifying non-Pareto optimal objects, the framework only chooses candidate questions which must satisfy three conditions. This design is both sufficient and efficient, as it is proven to find a short terminal question sequence. The framework is further steered by two ideas---macro-ordering and micro-ordering. By different micro-ordering heuristics, the framework is instantiated into several algorithms with varying power in pruning questions. Experiment results using both real crowdsourcing marketplace and simulations exhibited not only orders of magnitude reductions in questions when compared with a brute-force approach, but also close-to-optimal performance from the most efficient instantiation.",0
"We present a novel approach for automatic report generation from time-series data, in the context of student feedback generation. Our proposed methodology treats content selection as a multi-label classification (MLC) problem, which takes as input time-series data (students' learning data) and outputs a summary of these data (feedback). Unlike previous work, this method considers all data simultaneously using ensembles of classifiers, and therefore, it achieves higher accuracy and F- score compared to meaningful baselines.",0
"This paper relates comparative belief structures and a general view of belief management in the setting of deductively closed logical representations of accepted beliefs. We show that the range of compatibility between the classical deductive closure and uncertain reasoning covers precisely the nonmonotonic 'preferential' inference system of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor and nothing else. In terms of uncertain reasoning any possibility or necessity measure gives birth to a structure of accepted beliefs. The classes of probability functions and of Shafer's belief functions which yield belief sets prove to be very special ones.",0
"Much work in AI deals with the selection of proper actions in a given (known or unknown) environment. However, the way to select a proper action when facing other agents is quite unclear. Most work in AI adopts classical game-theoretic equilibrium analysis to predict agent behavior in such settings. This approach however does not provide us with any guarantee for the agent. In this paper we introduce competitive safety analysis. This approach bridges the gap between the desired normative AI approach, where a strategy should be selected in order to guarantee a desired payoff, and equilibrium analysis. We show that a safety level strategy is able to guarantee the value obtained in a Nash equilibrium, in several classical computer science settings. Then, we discuss the concept of competitive safety strategies, and illustrate its use in a decentralized load balancing setting, typical to network problems. In particular, we show that when we have many agents, it is possible to guarantee an expected payoff which is a factor of 8/9 of the payoff obtained in a Nash equilibrium. Our discussion of competitive safety analysis for decentralized load balancing is further developed to deal with many communication links and arbitrary speeds. Finally, we discuss the extension of the above concepts to Bayesian games, and illustrate their use in a basic auctions setup.",0
"This paper describes a new algorithm to solve the decision making problem in Influence Diagrams based on algorithms for credal networks. Decision nodes are associated to imprecise probability distributions and a reformulation is introduced that finds the global maximum strategy with respect to the expected utility. We work with Limited Memory Influence Diagrams, which generalize most Influence Diagram proposals and handle simultaneous decisions. Besides the global optimum method, we explore an anytime approximate solution with a guaranteed maximum error and show that imprecise probabilities are handled in a straightforward way. Complexity issues and experiments with random diagrams and an effects-based military planning problem are discussed.",0
"In a smart city, real-time traffic sensors may be deployed for various applications, such as route planning. Unfortunately, sensors are prone to failures, which result in erroneous traffic data. Erroneous data can adversely affect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased travel time and environmental impact. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly and with high accuracy. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large number of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e., missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In this paper, we devise an effective detector for identifying faulty traffic sensors using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize losses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterize critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planning application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using a real-world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.",0
"In this paper, we propose a new autonomous braking system based on deep reinforcement learning. The proposed autonomous braking system automatically decides whether to apply the brake at each time step when confronting the risk of collision using the information on the obstacle obtained by the sensors. The problem of designing brake control is formulated as searching for the optimal policy in Markov decision process (MDP) model where the state is given by the relative position of the obstacle and the vehicle's speed, and the action space is defined as whether brake is stepped or not. The policy used for brake control is learned through computer simulations using the deep reinforcement learning method called deep Q-network (DQN). In order to derive desirable braking policy, we propose the reward function which balances the damage imposed to the obstacle in case of accident and the reward achieved when the vehicle runs out of risk as soon as possible. DQN is trained for the scenario where a vehicle is encountered with a pedestrian crossing the urban road. Experiments show that the control agent exhibits desirable control behavior and avoids collision without any mistake in various uncertain environments.",0
"There is sufficient information in the far-field of a radiating dipole antenna to rediscover the Maxwell Equations and the wave equations of light, including the speed of light $c.$ TheoSea is a Julia program that does this in about a second, and the key insight is that the compactness of theories drives the search. The program is a computational embodiment of the scientific method: observation, consideration of candidate theories, and validation.",0
"This article is about how the ""SP theory of intelligence"" and its realisation in the ""SP machine"" (both outlined in the article) may help to solve computer-related problems in the design of autonomous robots, meaning robots that do not depend on external intelligence or power supplies, are mobile, and are designed to exhibit as much human-like intelligence as possible. The article is about: how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of computers and reduce their bulk; how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. The SP system has potential for substantial gains in computational and energy efficiency and reductions in the bulkiness of computers: by reducing the size of data to be processed; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers; and via an updated version of Donald Hebb's concept of a ""cell assembly"". Towards human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with seamless integration amongst structures and functions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help to achieve human-like adaptability in intelligence via: the learning of natural language; learning to see; building 3D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's environment; exploration and play; learning major skills; and secondary forms of learning. Also discussed are: how the SP system may process parallel streams of information; generalisation of knowledge, correction of over-generalisations, and learning from dirty data; how to cut the cost of learning; and reinforcements, motivations, goals, and demonstration.",0
"By utilizing different communication channels, such as verbal language, gestures or facial expressions, virtually embodied interactive humans hold a unique potential to bridge the gap between human-computer interaction and actual interhuman communication. The use of virtual humans is consequently becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of areas where such a natural communication might be beneficial, including entertainment, education, mental health research and beyond. Behind this development lies a series of technological advances in a multitude of disciplines, most notably natural language processing, computer vision, and speech synthesis. In this paper we discuss a Virtual Human Journalist, a project employing a number of novel solutions from these disciplines with the goal to demonstrate their viability by producing a humanoid conversational agent capable of naturally eliciting and reacting to information from a human user. A set of qualitative and quantitative evaluation sessions demonstrated the technical feasibility of the system whilst uncovering a number of deficits in its capacity to engage users in a way that would be perceived as natural and emotionally engaging. We argue that naturalness should not always be seen as a desirable goal and suggest that deliberately suppressing the naturalness of virtual human interactions, such as by altering its personality cues, might in some cases yield more desirable results.",0
"The efficiency of current cargo screening processes at sea and air ports is unknown as no benchmarks exists against which they could be measured. Some manufacturer benchmarks exist for individual sensors but we have not found any benchmarks that take a holistic view of the screening procedures assessing a combination of sensors and also taking operator variability into account. Just adding up resources and manpower used is not an effective way for assessing systems where human decision-making and operator compliance to rules play a vital role. For such systems more advanced assessment methods need to be used, taking into account that the cargo screening process is of a dynamic and stochastic nature. Our project aim is to develop a decision support tool (cargo-screening system simulator) that will map the right technology and manpower to the right commodity-threat combination in order to maximize detection rates. In this paper we present a project outline and highlight the research challenges we have identified so far. In addition we introduce our first case study, where we investigate the cargo screening process at the ferry port in Calais.",0
"We propose a new mechanism for integration of OWL ontologies using semantic import relations. In contrast to the standard OWL importing, we do not require all axioms of the imported ontologies to be taken into account for reasoning tasks, but only their logical implications over a chosen signature. This property comes natural in many ontology integration scenarios, especially when the number of ontologies is large. In this paper, we study the complexity of reasoning over ontologies with semantic import relations and establish a range of tight complexity bounds for various fragments of OWL.",0
"Even today in Twenty First Century Handwritten communication has its own stand and most of the times, in daily life it is globally using as means of communication and recording the information like to be shared with others. Challenges in handwritten characters recognition wholly lie in the variation and distortion of handwritten characters, since different people may use different style of handwriting, and direction to draw the same shape of the characters of their known script. This paper demonstrates the nature of handwritten characters, conversion of handwritten data into electronic data, and the neural network approach to make machine capable of recognizing hand written characters.",0
"This paper introduces a cognitive architecture for a humanoid robot to engage in a proactive, mixed-initiative exploration and manipulation of its environment, where the initiative can originate from both the human and the robot. The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in a human-robot interaction experiment with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario.",0
"The goal of diagnosis is to compute good repair strategies in response to anomalous system behavior. In a decision theoretic framework, a good repair strategy has low expected cost. In a general formulation of the problem, the computation of the optimal (lowest expected cost) repair strategy for a system with multiple faults is intractable. In this paper, we consider an interesting and natural restriction on the behavior of the system being diagnosed: (a) the system exhibits faulty behavior if and only if one or more components is malfunctioning. (b) The failures of the system components are independent. Given this restriction on system behavior, we develop a polynomial time algorithm for computing the optimal repair strategy. We then go on to introduce a system hierarchy and the notion of inspecting (testing) components before repair. We develop a linear time algorithm for computing an optimal repair strategy for the hierarchical system which includes both repair and inspection.",0
"We investigate crowdsourcing algorithms for finding the top-quality item within a large collection of objects with unknown intrinsic quality values. This is an important problem with many relevant applications, for example in networked recommendation systems. The core of the algorithms is that objects are distributed to crowd workers, who return a noisy evaluation. All received evaluations are then combined, to identify the top-quality object. We first present a simple probabilistic model for the system under investigation. Then, we devise and study a class of efficient adaptive algorithms to assign in an effective way objects to workers. We compare the performance of several algorithms, which correspond to different choices of the design parameters/metrics. We finally compare our approach based on scoring object qualities against traditional proposals based on comparisons and tournaments.",0
"Backdoors and backbones of Boolean formulas are hidden structural properties that are relevant to the analysis of the hardness of instances of the SAT problem. The development and analysis of algorithms to find and make use of these properties is thus useful to improve the performance of modern solvers and our general understanding of SAT. In this work we show that, under the assumption that P$\neq$NP, there are easily-recognizable sets of Boolean formulas for which it is hard to determine whether they have a backbone. We also show that, under the same assumption, there are easily-recognizable families of Boolean formulas with strong backdoors that are easy to find, for which it is hard to determine whether they are satisfiable or not.",0
"One of the most difficult problems in the development of intelligent systems is the construction of the underlying knowledge base. As a consequence, the rate of progress in the development of this type of system is directly related to the speed with which knowledge bases can be assembled, and on its quality. We attempt to solve the knowledge acquisition problem, for a Business Information System, developing a supervised multistrategy learning paradigm. This paradigm is centred on a collaborative data mining strategy, where groups of experts collaborate using data-mining process on the supervised acquisition of new knowledge extracted from heterogeneous machine learning data models.",0
"Memory-Bounded Dynamic Programming (MBDP) has proved extremely effective in solving decentralized POMDPs with large horizons. We generalize the algorithm and improve its scalability by reducing the complexity with respect to the number of observations from exponential to polynomial. We derive error bounds on solution quality with respect to this new approximation and analyze the convergence behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements, we introduce a new, larger benchmark problem. Experimental results show that despite the high complexity of decentralized POMDPs, scalable solution techniques such as MBDP perform surprisingly well.",0
"Planning problems are hard, motion planning, for example, isPSPACE-hard. Such problems are even more difficult in the presence of uncertainty. Although, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a formal framework for such problems, finding solutions to high dimensional continuous MDPs is usually difficult, especially when the actions and time measurements are continuous. Fortunately, problem-specific knowledge allows us to design controllers that are good locally, though having no global guarantees. We propose a method of nonparametrically combining local controllers to obtain globally good solutions. We apply this formulation to two types of problems : motion planning (stochastic shortest path) and discounted MDPs. For motion planning, we argue that usual MDP optimality criterion (expected cost) may not be practically relevant. Wepropose an alternative: finding the minimum cost path,subject to the constraint that the robot must reach the goal withhigh probability. For this problem, we prove that a polynomial number of samples is sufficient to obtain a high probability path. For discounted MDPs, we propose a formulation that explicitly deals with model uncertainty, i.e., the problem introduced when transition probabilities are not known exactly. We formulate the problem as a robust linear program which directly incorporates this type of uncertainty.",0
"Practically all programming languages allow the programmer to split a program into several modules which brings along several advantages in software development. In this paper, we are interested in the area of answer-set programming where fully declarative and nonmonotonic languages are applied. In this context, obtaining a modular structure for programs is by no means straightforward since the output of an entire program cannot in general be composed from the output of its components. To better understand the effects of disjunctive information on modularity we restrict the scope of analysis to the case of disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) subject to stable-model semantics. We define the notion of a DLP-function, where a well-defined input/output interface is provided, and establish a novel module theorem which indicates the compositionality of stable-model semantics for DLP-functions. The module theorem extends the well-known splitting-set theorem and enables the decomposition of DLP-functions given their strongly connected components based on positive dependencies induced by rules. In this setting, it is also possible to split shared disjunctive rules among components using a generalized shifting technique. The concept of modular equivalence is introduced for the mutual comparison of DLP-functions using a generalization of a translation-based verification method.",0
"In this paper, we explore how modifying data to preserve privacy affects the quality of the patterns discoverable in the data. For any analysis of modified data to be worth doing, the data must be as close to the original as possible. Therein lies a problem -- how does one make sure that modified data still contains the information it had before modification? This question is not the same as asking if an accurate classifier can be built from the modified data. Often in the literature, the prediction accuracy of a classifier made from modified (anonymized) data is used as evidence that the data is similar to the original. We demonstrate that this is not the case, and we propose a new methodology for measuring the retention of the patterns that existed in the original data. We then use our methodology to design three measures that can be easily implemented, each measuring aspects of the data that no pre-existing techniques can measure. These measures do not negate the usefulness of prediction accuracy or other measures -- they are complementary to them, and support our argument that one measure is almost never enough.",0
"Description Logic Programs (dl-programs) proposed by Eiter et al. constitute an elegant yet powerful formalism for the integration of answer set programming with description logics, for the Semantic Web. In this paper, we generalize the notions of completion and loop formulas of logic programs to description logic programs and show that the answer sets of a dl-program can be precisely captured by the models of its completion and loop formulas. Furthermore, we propose a new, alternative semantics for dl-programs, called the {\em canonical answer set semantics}, which is defined by the models of completion that satisfy what are called canonical loop formulas. A desirable property of canonical answer sets is that they are free of circular justifications. Some properties of canonical answer sets are also explored.",0
"Exchangeability is a central notion in statistics and probability theory. The assumption that an infinite sequence of data points is exchangeable is at the core of Bayesian statistics. However, finite exchangeability as a statistical property that renders probabilistic inference tractable is less well-understood. We develop a theory of finite exchangeability and its relation to tractable probabilistic inference. The theory is complementary to that of independence and conditional independence. We show that tractable inference in probabilistic models with high treewidth and millions of variables can be understood using the notion of finite (partial) exchangeability. We also show that existing lifted inference algorithms implicitly utilize a combination of conditional independence and partial exchangeability.",1
"The properties of local optimal solutions in multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems are crucial for the effectiveness of local search algorithms, particularly when these algorithms are based on Pareto dominance. Such local search algorithms typically return a set of mutually nondominated Pareto local optimal (PLO) solutions, that is, a PLO-set. This paper investigates two aspects of PLO-sets by means of experiments with Pareto local search (PLS). First, we examine the impact of several problem characteristics on the properties of PLO-sets for multi-objective NK-landscapes with correlated objectives. In particular, we report that either increasing the number of objectives or decreasing the correlation between objectives leads to an exponential increment on the size of PLO-sets, whereas the variable correlation has only a minor effect. Second, we study the running time and the quality reached when using bounding archiving methods to limit the size of the archive handled by PLS, and thus, the maximum size of the PLO-set found. We argue that there is a clear relationship between the running time of PLS and the difficulty of a problem instance.",0
"In this work, we study an important problem: learning programs from input-output examples. We propose a novel method to learn a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine, and demonstrate that this method can be applied to learn programs that are significantly more complex than the ones synthesized before: programming language parsers from input-output pairs without knowing the underlying grammar. The main challenge is to train the neural program without supervision on execution traces. To tackle it, we propose: (1) LL machines and neural programs operating them to effectively regularize the space of the learned programs; and (2) a two-phase reinforcement learning-based search technique to train the model. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach can successfully learn to parse programs in both an imperative language and a functional language, and achieve 100% test accuracy, while existing approaches' accuracies are almost 0%. This is the first successful demonstration of applying reinforcement learning to train a neural program operating a non-differentiable machine that can fully generalize to test sets on a non-trivial task.",0
"The theoretical properties of qualitative spatial reasoning in the RCC8 framework have been analyzed extensively. However, no empirical investigation has been made yet. Our experiments show that the adaption of the algorithms used for qualitative temporal reasoning can solve large RCC8 instances, even if they are in the phase transition region -- provided that one uses the maximal tractable subsets of RCC8 that have been identified by us. In particular, we demonstrate that the orthogonal combination of heuristic methods is successful in solving almost all apparently hard instances in the phase transition region up to a certain size in reasonable time.",0
"We propose a protocol for intrusion detection in distributed systems based on a relatively recent theory in immunology called danger theory. Based on danger theory, immune response in natural systems is a result of sensing corruption as well as sensing unknown substances. In contrast, traditional self-nonself discrimination theory states that immune response is only initiated by sensing nonself (unknown) patterns. Danger theory solves many problems that could only be partially explained by the traditional model. Although the traditional model is simpler, such problems result in high false positive rates in immune-inspired intrusion detection systems. We believe using danger theory in a multi-agent environment that computationally emulates the behavior of natural immune systems is effective in reducing false positive rates. We first describe a simplified scenario of immune response in natural systems based on danger theory and then, convert it to a computational model as a network protocol. In our protocol, we define several immune signals and model cell signaling via message passing between agents that emulate cells. Most messages include application-specific patterns that must be meaningfully extracted from various system properties. We finally provide a few rules of thumb to simplify the task of pattern extraction in most distributed systems.",0
"We present PARIS, an approach for the automatic alignment of ontologies. PARIS aligns not only instances, but also relations and classes. Alignments at the instance-level cross-fertilize with alignments at the schema-level. Thereby, our system provides a truly holistic solution to the problem of ontology alignment. The heart of the approach is probabilistic. This allows PARIS to run without any parameter tuning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm and its precision through extensive experiments. In particular, we obtain a precision of around 80% in experiments with two of the world's largest ontologies.",0
"Conditional Simple Temporal Network (CSTN) is a constraint-based graph-formalism for conditional temporal planning. It offers a more flexible formalism than the equivalent CSTP model of Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack, from which it was derived mainly as a sound formalization. Three notions of consistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic consistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging and it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack gave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic execution strategy of exponential size. In the present work we offer a proof that deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent is coNP-hard and provide the first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a dynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent. The algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family of two-player combinatorial games on graphs well known for having applications in model-checking and formal verification. The presentation of such connection is mediated by the Hyper Temporal Network model, a tractable generalization of Simple Temporal Networks whose consistency checking is equivalent to determining Mean Payoff Games. In order to analyze the algorithm we introduce a refined notion of dynamic-consistency, named \epsilon-dynamic-consistency, and present a sharp lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction time \hat{\varepsilon} where the CSTN transits from being, to not being, dynamically-consistent. The proof technique introduced in this analysis of \hat{\varepsilon} is applicable more in general when dealing with linear difference constraints which include strict inequalities.",0
"We study machine learning formulations of inductive program synthesis; given input-output examples, we try to synthesize source code that maps inputs to corresponding outputs. Our aims are to develop new machine learning approaches based on neural networks and graphical models, and to understand the capabilities of machine learning techniques relative to traditional alternatives, such as those based on constraint solving from the programming languages community.",0
"Grids with blocked and unblocked cells are often used to represent terrain in robotics and video games. However, paths formed by grid edges can be longer than true shortest paths in the terrain since their headings are artificially constrained. We present two new correct and complete any-angle path-planning algorithms that avoid this shortcoming. Basic Theta* and Angle-Propagation Theta* are both variants of A* that propagate information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid edges. Basic Theta* is simple to understand and implement, fast and finds short paths. However, it is not guaranteed to find true shortest paths. Angle-Propagation Theta* achieves a better worst-case complexity per vertex expansion than Basic Theta* by propagating angle ranges when it expands vertices, but is more complex, not as fast and finds slightly longer paths. We refer to Basic Theta* and Angle-Propagation Theta* collectively as Theta*. Theta* has unique properties, which we analyze in detail. We show experimentally that it finds shorter paths than both A* with post-smoothed paths and Field D* (the only other version of A* we know of that propagates information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid edges) with a runtime comparable to that of A* on grids. Finally, we extend Theta* to grids that contain unblocked cells with non-uniform traversal costs and introduce variants of Theta* which provide different tradeoffs between path length and runtime.",1
"In a supervisory control system the human agent knowledge of past, current, and future system behavior is critical for system performance. Being able to reason about that knowledge in a precise and structured manner is central to effective system design. In this paper we introduce the application of a well-established formal approach to reasoning about knowledge to the modeling and analysis of complex human-automation systems. An intuitive notion of knowledge in human-automation systems is sketched and then cast as a formal model. We present a case study in which the approach is used to model and reason about a classic problem from the human-automation systems literature; the results of our analysis provide evidence for the validity and value of reasoning about complex systems in terms of the knowledge of the system agents. To conclude, we discuss research directions that will extend this approach, and note several systems in the aviation and human-robot team domains that are of particular interest.",0
"Research on Symbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) [2, 3] has provided an algorithm for resolving general queries in Bayesian networks. SPI applies the concept of dependency directed backward search to probabilistic inference, and is incremental with respect to both queries and observations. Unlike traditional Bayesian network inferencing algorithms, SPI algorithm is goal directed, performing only those calculations that are required to respond to queries. Research to date on SPI applies to Bayesian networks with discrete-valued variables and does not address variables with continuous values. In this papers, we extend the SPI algorithm to handle Bayesian networks made up of continuous variables where the relationships between the variables are restricted to be ?linear gaussian?. We call this variation of the SPI algorithm, SPI Continuous (SPIC). SPIC modifies the three basic SPI operations: multiplication, summation, and substitution. However, SPIC retains the framework of the SPI algorithm, namely building the search tree and recursive query mechanism and therefore retains the goal-directed and incrementality features of SPI.",0
"In this paper we conduct an analysis of Moodle activity data focused on identifying early predictors of good student performance. The analysis shows that three relevant hypotheses are largely supported by the data. These hypotheses are: early submission is a good sign, a high level of activity is predictive of good results and evening activity is even better than daytime activity. We highlight some pathological examples where high levels of activity correlates with bad results.",0
"Query answering in Answer Set Programming (ASP) is usually solved by computing (a subset of) the cautious consequences of a logic program. This task is computationally very hard, and there are programs for which computing cautious consequences is not viable in reasonable time. However, current ASP solvers produce the (whole) set of cautious consequences only at the end of their computation. This paper reports on strategies for computing cautious consequences, also introducing anytime algorithms able to produce sound answers during the computation.",0
"Collaborative Filtering aims at exploiting the feedback of users to provide personalised recommendations. Such algorithms look for latent variables in a large sparse matrix of ratings. They can be enhanced by adding side information to tackle the well-known cold start problem. While Neu-ral Networks have tremendous success in image and speech recognition, they have received less attention in Collaborative Filtering. This is all the more surprising that Neural Networks are able to discover latent variables in large and heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we introduce a Collaborative Filtering Neural network architecture aka CFN which computes a non-linear Matrix Factorization from sparse rating inputs and side information. We show experimentally on the MovieLens and Douban dataset that CFN outper-forms the state of the art and benefits from side information. We provide an implementation of the algorithm as a reusable plugin for Torch, a popular Neural Network framework.",0
"The Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) framework allows representing and solving problems involving both hard constraints and cost functions. It has been applied to various problems, including resource allocation, bioinformatics, scheduling, etc. To solve such problems, solvers usually rely on branch-and-bound algorithms equipped with local consistency filtering, mostly soft arc consistency. However, these techniques are not well suited to solve problems with very large domains. Motivated by the resolution of an RNA gene localization problem inside large genomic sequences, and in the spirit of bounds consistency for large domains in crisp CSPs, we introduce soft bounds arc consistency, a new weighted local consistency specifically designed for WCSP with very large domains. Compared to soft arc consistency, BAC provides significantly improved time and space asymptotic complexity. In this paper, we show how the semantics of cost functions can be exploited to further improve the time complexity of BAC. We also compare both in theory and in practice the efficiency of BAC on a WCSP with bounds consistency enforced on a crisp CSP using cost variables. On two different real problems modeled as WCSP, including our RNA gene localization problem, we observe that maintaining bounds arc consistency outperforms arc consistency and also improves over bounds consistency enforced on a constraint model with cost variables.",0
"Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) are very useful in the fields of machine learning and data mining. The crucial limitation of those models,however, is the scalability. The Bayesian Network, which is one of the most common PGMs used in machine learning and data mining, demonstrates this limitation when the training data consists of random variables, each of them has a large set of possible values. In the big data era, one would expect new extensions to the existing PGMs to handle the massive amount of data produced these days by computers, sensors and other electronic devices. With hierarchical data - data that is arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect to see hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a small number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across large data sets, Bayesian Networks become infeasible for representing the probability distributions. In this paper we introduce an extension to Bayesian Networks to handle massive sets of hierarchical data in a reasonable amount of time and space. The proposed model achieves perfect precision of 1.0 and high recall of 0.93 when it is used as multi-label classifier for the annotation of mass spectrometry data. On another data set of 1.5 billion search logs provided by CareerBuilder.com the model was able to predict latent semantic relationships between search keywords with accuracy up to 0.80.",0
"We address a problem of area protection in graph-based scenarios with multiple agents. The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices. We study strategies for allocating vertices to be occupied by the team of defenders to block attacking agents. We show that the decision version of the problem of area protection is PSPACE-hard under the assumption that agents can allocate their target vertices multiple times. Further we develop various on-line vertex-allocation strategies for the defender team in a simplified variant of the problem with single stage vertex allocation and evaluated their performance in multiple benchmarks. The success of a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of the contributions of this work is that we identify suitable vertex-allocation strategies for diverse instance types. In particular, we introduce a simulation-based method that identifies and tries to capture bottlenecks in the graph, that are frequently used by the attackers. Our experimental evaluation suggests that this method often allows a successful defense even in instances where the attackers significantly outnumber the defenders.",0
"Formal methods apply algorithms based on mathematical principles to enhance the reliability of systems. It would only be natural to try to progress from verification, model checking or testing a system against its formal specification into constructing it automatically. Classical algorithmic synthesis theory provides interesting algorithms but also alarming high complexity and undecidability results. The use of genetic programming, in combination with model checking and testing, provides a powerful heuristic to synthesize programs. The method is not completely automatic, as it is fine tuned by a user that sets up the specification and parameters. It also does not guarantee to always succeed and converge towards a solution that satisfies all the required properties. However, we applied it successfully on quite nontrivial examples and managed to find solutions to hard programming challenges, as well as to improve and to correct code. We describe here several versions of our method for synthesizing sequential and concurrent systems.",0
"Feature subspace selection is an important part in speech emotion recognition. Most of the studies are devoted to finding a feature subspace for representing all emotions. However, some studies have indicated that the features associated with different emotions are not exactly the same. Hence, traditional methods may fail to distinguish some of the emotions with just one global feature subspace. In this work, we propose a new divide and conquer idea to solve the problem. First, the feature subspaces are constructed for all the combinations of every two different emotions (emotion-pair). Bi-classifiers are then trained on these feature subspaces respectively. The final emotion recognition result is derived by the voting and competition method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can get better results than the traditional multi-classification method.",0

"In this article we propose a qualitative (ordinal) counterpart for the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes model (POMDP) in which the uncertainty, as well as the preferences of the agent, are modeled by possibility distributions. This qualitative counterpart of the POMDP model relies on a possibilistic theory of decision under uncertainty, recently developed. One advantage of such a qualitative framework is its ability to escape from the classical obstacle of stochastic POMDPs, in which even with a finite state space, the obtained belief state space of the POMDP is infinite. Instead, in the possibilistic framework even if exponentially larger than the state space, the belief state space remains finite.",0
"This paper introduces an environment for simple 2D maze games, designed as a sandbox for machine learning approaches to reasoning and planning. Within it, we create 10 simple games based on algorithmic tasks (e.g. embodying simple if-then statements). We deploy a range of neural models (fully connected, convolutional network, memory network) on these games, with and without a procedurally generated curriculum. We show that these architectures can be trained with reinforcement to respectable performance on these tasks, but are still far from optimal, despite their simplicity. We also apply these models to games involving combat, including StarCraft, demonstrating their ability to learn non-trivial tactics which enable them to consistently beat the in-game AI.",0
"Since Alan Turing envisioned Artificial Intelligence (AI) [1], a major driving force behind technical progress has been competition with human cognition. Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.",0

"Mediation is a process, in which both parties agree to resolve their dispute by negotiating over alternative solutions presented by a mediator. In order to construct such solutions, mediation brings more information and knowledge, and, if possible, resources to the negotiation table. The contribution of this paper is the automated mediation machinery which does that. It presents an argumentation-based mediation approach that extends the logic-based approach to argumentation-based negotiation involving BDI agents. The paper describes the mediation algorithm. For comparison it illustrates the method with a case study used in an earlier work. It demonstrates how the computational mediator can deal with realistic situations in which the negotiating agents would otherwise fail due to lack of knowledge and/or resources.",0

This controlled language can be used to write non-monotonic specifications that have the same expressive power as Answer Set Programs. In order to support the writing process of these specifications, the predictive text editor communicates asynchronously with the controlled natural language processor that generates lookahead categories and additional auxiliary information for the author of a specification text. The text editor can display multiple sets of lookahead categories simultaneously for different possible sentence completions, anaphoric expressions, and supports the addition of new content words to the lexicon.",0
"Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful representation often used to formulate decision-making problems under uncertainty. However, it lacks a natural mechanism to reason about objects, classes of objects, and relations. First-order logic (FOL), on the other hand, excels at reasoning about classes of objects, but lacks a rich representation of uncertainty. While representing propositional logic in MILP has been extensively explored, no theory exists yet for fully combining FOL with MILP. We propose a new representation, called first-order programming or FOP, which subsumes both FOL and MILP. We establish formal methods for reasoning about first order programs, including a sound and complete lifted inference procedure for integer first order programs. Since FOP can offer exponential savings in representation and proof size compared to FOL, and since representations and proofs are never significantly longer in FOP than in FOL, we anticipate that inference in FOP will be more tractable than inference in FOL for corresponding problems.",0
"The majority of big data is unstructured and of this majority the largest chunk is text. While data mining techniques are well developed and standardized for structured, numerical data, the realm of unstructured data is still largely unexplored. The general focus lies on information extraction, which attempts to retrieve known information from text. The Holy Grail, however is knowledge discovery, where machines are expected to unearth entirely new facts and relations that were not previously known by any human expert. Indeed, understanding the meaning of text is often considered as one of the main characteristics of human intelligence. The ultimate goal of semantic artificial intelligence is to devise software that can understand the meaning of free text, at least in the practical sense of providing new, actionable information condensed out of a body of documents. As a stepping stone on the road to this vision I will introduce a totally new approach to drug research, namely that of identifying relevant information by employing a self-organizing semantic engine to text mine large repositories of biomedical research papers, a technique pioneered by Merck with the InfoCodex software. I will describe the methodology and a first successful experiment for the discovery of new biomarkers and phenotypes for diabetes and obesity on the basis of PubMed abstracts, public clinical trials and Merck internal documents. The reported approach shows much promise and has potential to impact fundamentally pharmaceutical research as a way to shorten time-to-market of novel drugs, and for early recognition of dead ends.",0
"Multi-relational learning has received lots of attention from researchers in various research communities. Most existing methods either suffer from superlinear per-iteration cost, or are sensitive to the given ranks. To address both issues, we propose a scalable core tensor trace norm Regularized Orthogonal Iteration Decomposition (ROID) method for full or incomplete tensor analytics, which can be generalized as a graph Laplacian regularized version by using auxiliary information or a sparse higher-order orthogonal iteration (SHOOI) version. We first induce the equivalence relation of the Schatten p-norm (0&lt;p&lt;\infty) of a low multi-linear rank tensor and its core tensor. Then we achieve a much smaller matrix trace norm minimization problem. Finally, we develop two efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithms to solve our problems with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets, even though with only a few observations, verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.",0
"Special-purpose constraint propagation algorithms frequently make implicit use of short supports -- by examining a subset of the variables, they can infer support (a justification that a variable-value pair may still form part of an assignment that satisfies the constraint) for all other variables and values and save substantial work -- but short supports have not been studied in their own right. The two main contributions of this paper are the identification of short supports as important for constraint propagation, and the introduction of HaggisGAC, an efficient and effective general purpose propagation algorithm for exploiting short supports. Given the complexity of HaggisGAC, we present it as an optimised version of a simpler algorithm ShortGAC. Although experiments demonstrate the efficiency of ShortGAC compared with other general-purpose propagation algorithms where a compact set of short supports is available, we show theoretically and experimentally that HaggisGAC is even better. We also find that HaggisGAC performs better than GAC-Schema on full-length supports. We also introduce a variant algorithm HaggisGAC-Stable, which is adapted to avoid work on backtracking and in some cases can be faster and have significant reductions in memory use. All the proposed algorithms are excellent for propagating disjunctions of constraints. In all experiments with disjunctions we found our algorithms to be faster than Constructive Or and GAC-Schema by at least an order of magnitude, and up to three orders of magnitude.",0
"The Countdown game is one of the oldest TV show running in the world. It started broadcasting in 1972 on the french television and in 1982 on British channel 4, and it has been running since in both countries. The game, while extremely popular, never received any serious scientific attention, probably because it seems too simple at first sight. We present in this article an in-depth analysis of the numbers round of the countdown game. This includes a complexity analysis of the game, an analysis of existing algorithms, the presentation of a new algorithm that increases resolution speed by a factor of 20. It also includes some leads on how to turn the game into a more difficult one, both for a human player and for a computer, and even to transform it into a probably undecidable problem.",0
"This paper summarizes the recent progress we have made for the computer vision technologies in physical therapy with the accessible and affordable devices. We first introduce the remote health coaching system we build with Microsoft Kinect. Since the motion data captured by Kinect is noisy, we investigate the data accuracy of Kinect with respect to the high accuracy motion capture system. We also propose an outlier data removal algorithm based on the data distribution. In order to generate the kinematic parameter from the noisy data captured by Kinect, we propose a kinematic filtering algorithm based on Unscented Kalman Filter and the kinematic model of human skeleton. The proposed algorithm can obtain smooth kinematic parameter with reduced noise compared to the kinematic parameter generated from the raw motion data from Kinect.",0
"This paper describes a process for clustering concepts into chains from data presented randomly to an evaluating system. There are a number of rules or guidelines that help the system to determine more accurately what concepts belong to a particular chain and what ones do not, but it should be possible to write these in a generic way. This mechanism also uses a flat structure without any hierarchical path information, where the link between two concepts is made at the level of the concept itself. It does not require related metadata, but instead, a simple counting mechanism is used. Key to this is a count for both the concept itself and also the group or chain that it belongs to. To test the possible success of the mechanism, concept chain parts taken randomly from a larger ontology were presented to the system, but only at a depth of 2 concepts each time. That is - root concept plus a concept that it is linked to. The results show that this can still lead to very variable structures being formed and can also accommodate some level of randomness.",0

"In this paper we present a hybrid approach for automatic composition of Web services that generates semantic input-output based compositions with optimal end-to-end QoS, minimizing the number of services of the resulting composition. The proposed approach has four main steps: 1) generation of the composition graph for a request; 2) computation of the optimal composition that minimizes a single objective QoS function; 3) multi-step optimizations to reduce the search space by identifying equivalent and dominated services; and 4) hybrid local-global search to extract the optimal QoS with the minimum number of services. An extensive validation with the datasets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 and randomly generated datasets shows that: 1) the combination of local and global optimization is a general and powerful technique to extract optimal compositions in diverse scenarios; and 2) the hybrid strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art, obtaining solutions with less services and optimal QoS.",0

"Singleton arc consistency is an important type of local consistency which has been recently shown to solve all constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) over constraint languages of bounded width. We aim to characterise all classes of CSPs defined by a forbidden pattern that are solved by singleton arc consistency and closed under removing constraints.

Combined with simple counter-examples for other patterns, we make significant progress towards a complete classification.",0

After introducing principles of attention-sensitive alerting, we focus on the problem of guiding alerts about email messages. We dwell on the problem of inferring the expected criticality of email and discuss work on the Priorities system, centering on prioritizing email by criticality and modulating the communication of notifications to users about the presence and nature of incoming email.",0
"We present a system for recognising human activity given a symbolic representation of video content. The input of our system is a set of time-stamped short-term activities (STA) detected on video frames. The output is a set of recognised long-term activities (LTA), which are pre-defined temporal combinations of STA. The constraints on the STA that, if satisfied, lead to the recognition of a LTA, have been expressed using a dialect of the Event Calculus. In order to handle the uncertainty that naturally occurs in human activity recognition, we adapted this dialect to a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming framework. We present a detailed evaluation and comparison of the crisp and probabilistic approaches through experimentation on a benchmark dataset of human surveillance videos.",0
"Business ontology can enhance the successful development of complex enterprise system; this is being achieved through knowledge sharing and the ease of communication between every entity in the domain. Through human semantic interaction with the web resources, machines to interpret the data published in a machine interpretable form under web. However, the theoretical practice of business ontology in eCommerce domain is quite a few especially in the section of electronic transaction, and the various techniques used to obtain efficient communication across spheres are error prone and are not always guaranteed to be efficient in obtaining desired result due to poor semantic integration between entities. To overcome the poor semantic integration this research focuses on proposed ontology called LB2CO, which combines the framework of IDEF5 &amp; SNAP as an analysis tool, for automated recommendation of product and services and create effective ontological framework for B2C transaction &amp; communication across different business domains that facilitates the interoperability &amp; integration of B2C transactions over the web.",0
"In this paper we study complexity of an extension of ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) called $c$-OBDDs on CNFs of bounded (primal graph) treewidth. In particular, we show that for each $k$ there is a class of CNFs of treewidth $k \geq 3$ for which the equivalent $c$-OBDDs are of size $\Omega(n^{k/(8c-4)})$. Moreover, this lower bound holds if $c$-OBDD is non-deterministic and semantic. Our second result uses the above lower bound to separate the above model from sentential decision diagrams (SDDs). In order to obtain the lower bound, we use a structural graph parameter called matching width. Our third result shows that matching width and pathwidth are linearly related.",0
"We present alternative definitions of the first-order stable model semantics and its extension to incorporate generalized quantifiers by referring to the familiar notion of a reduct instead of referring to the SM operator in the original definitions. Also, we extend the FLP stable model semantics to allow generalized quantifiers by referring to an operator that is similar to the $\sm$ operator. For a reasonable syntactic class of logic programs, we show that the two stable model semantics of generalized quantifiers are interchangeable.",0
"This article tackles a number of technical issues related to the AI definition. These include the format of the data, the Undef and Nothing symbols, different ways of defining the meaning of life, as well as the introduction of the concept of ""incorrect move"". These are issues of no material importance, if we are interested in the AI definition from a purely theoretical point of view; however, if we want to develop a real program satisfying that definition, we are to find these issues important.",0
"Object detection is considered one of the most challenging problems in this field of computer vision, as it involves the combination of object classification and object localization within a scene. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve superior object detection performance compared to other approaches, with YOLOv2 (an improved You Only Look Once model) being one of the state-of-the-art in DNN-based object detection methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Although YOLOv2 can achieve real-time performance on a powerful GPU, it still remains very challenging for leveraging this approach for real-time object detection in video on embedded computing devices with limited computational power and limited memory. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Fast YOLO, a fast You Only Look Once framework which accelerates YOLOv2 to be able to perform object detection in video on embedded devices in a real-time manner. First, we leverage the evolutionary deep intelligence framework to evolve the YOLOv2 network architecture and produce an optimized architecture (referred to as O-YOLOv2 here) that has 2.8X fewer parameters with just a ~2% IOU drop. To further reduce power consumption on embedded devices while maintaining performance, a motion-adaptive inference method is introduced into the proposed Fast YOLO framework to reduce the frequency of deep inference with O-YOLOv2 based on temporal motion characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed Fast YOLO framework can reduce the number of deep inferences by an average of 38.13%, and an average speedup of ~3.3X for objection detection in video compared to the original YOLOv2, leading Fast YOLO to run an average of ~18FPS on a Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded system.",0
"In this paper we present architecture of a fuzzy expert system used for therapy of dyslalic children. With fuzzy approach we can create a better model for speech therapist decisions. A software interface was developed for validation of the system. The main objectives of this task are: personalized therapy (the therapy must be in according with child's problems level, context and possibilities), speech therapist assistant (the expert system offer some suggestion regarding what exercises are better for a specific moment and from a specific child), (self) teaching (when system's conclusion is different that speech therapist's conclusion the last one must have the knowledge base change possibility).",0
"The stable model semantics had been recently generalized to non-Herbrand structures by several works, which provides a unified framework and solid logical foundations for answer set programming. This paper focuses on the expressiveness of normal and disjunctive programs under the general stable model semantics. A translation from disjunctive programs to normal programs is proposed for infinite structures. Over finite structures, some disjunctive programs are proved to be intranslatable to normal programs if the arities of auxiliary predicates and functions are bounded in a certain way. The equivalence of the expressiveness of normal programs and disjunctive programs over arbitrary structures is also shown to coincide with that over finite structures, and coincide with whether NP is closed under complement. Moreover, to capture the exact expressiveness, some intertranslatability results between logic program classes and fragments of second-order logic are obtained.",0
"This paper introduces the necessary and sufficient conditions that surrogate functions must satisfy to properly define frontiers of non-dominated solutions in multi-objective optimization problems. Given that this is the first time that those conditions are elicited, there is no reason to believe that the surrogates already proposed in the literature meet them. As a consequence, dominated solutions can be suggested by already proposed surrogates as valid candidates to represent the Pareto frontier. Conceptually speaking, the new conditions we are introducing work directly on the objective space, thus being agnostic on the evaluation methods. Therefore, real objectives or user-designed objectives' surrogates are allowed, opening the possibility of linking independent objective surrogates. To illustrate the practical consequences of adopting the proposed conditions, an oversimplified model for the surrogate is shown to be capable of suggesting a valid frontier of non-dominated solutions, though not the expect one from the data provided. On the other hand, when applying Gaussian processes as surrogates endowed with monotonicity soft constraints and with an adjustable degree of flexibility, the necessary and sufficient conditions proposed here are finely managed by the multivariate distribution, guiding to high-quality surrogates capable of suitably synthesizing an approximation to the Pareto frontier in challenging instances of multi-objective optimization.",0
"Residual learning has recently surfaced as an effective means of constructing very deep neural networks for object recognition. However, current incarnations of residual networks do not allow for the modeling and integration of complex relations between closely coupled recognition tasks or across domains. Such problems are often encountered in multimedia and vision applications involving large-scale content recognition. We propose a novel extension of residual learning for deep networks that enables intuitive learning across multiple related tasks using cross-connections called cross-residuals. These cross-residuals connections can be viewed as a form of in-network regularization and enables greater network generalization. We show how cross-residual learning (CRL) can be integrated in multitask networks to jointly train and detect visual concepts across several tasks. We present a single multitask cross-residual network with &gt;40% less parameters that is able to achieve competitive, or even better, detection performance on a visual sentiment concept detection problem normally requiring multiple specialized single-task networks. The resulting multitask cross-residual network also achieves better detection performance by about 10.4% over a standard multitask residual network without cross-residuals with even a small amount of cross-task weighting.",0
"This paper reports experiments with the causal independence inference algorithm proposed by Zhang and Poole (1994b) on the CPSC network created by Pradhan et al. (1994). It is found that the algorithm is able to answer 420 of the 422 possible zero-observation queries, 94 of 100 randomly generated five-observation queries, 87 of 100 randomly generated ten-observation queries, and 69 of 100 randomly generated twenty-observation queries.",0
"We consider a multi-neighborhood local search algorithm with a large number of possible neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is accompanied by a weight value which represents the probability of being chosen at each iteration. These weights are fixed before the algorithm runs, and are considered as parameters of the algorithm. Given a set of instances, off-line tuning of the algorithm's parameters can be done by automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC). However, the large number of neighborhoods can make the tuning expensive and difficult even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some intuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each neighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using cluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our characterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours according to hardness of different solution quality regions. We show that using neighborhood clusters instead of individual neighborhoods helps to reduce the parameter configuration space without misleading the search of the tuning procedure. Moreover, this method is problem-independent and potentially can be applied in similar contexts.",0
"We advance a novel model of choice in online interfaces in which agents with diverse yet correlated preferences search the alternatives in order of popularity and choose the first alternative with utility higher than a certain satisficing threshold. The model goes beyond existing accounts in that (i) it suggests a cognitive process through which social influence plays out in these markets (ii) it is bolstered by a rich utility framework and is thus amenable to welfare analysis, and (iii) it facilitates comparisons with scenarios without social influence. Using agent-based simulations we find that social social interaction leads to a larger increase in the average consumer welfare when there is at least some diversity of preferences in the consumer population.",0
"This paper describes team Turing's submission to SemEval 2017 RumourEval: Determining rumour veracity and support for rumours (SemEval 2017 Task 8, Subtask A). Subtask A addresses the challenge of rumour stance classification, which involves identifying the attitude of Twitter users towards the truthfulness of the rumour they are discussing. Stance classification is considered to be an important step towards rumour verification, therefore performing well in this task is expected to be useful in debunking false rumours. In this work we classify a set of Twitter posts discussing rumours into either supporting, denying, questioning or commenting on the underlying rumours. We propose a LSTM-based sequential model that, through modelling the conversational structure of tweets, which achieves an accuracy of 0.784 on the RumourEval test set outperforming all other systems in Subtask A.",0
"Independence-based (IB) assignments to Bayesian belief networks were originally proposed as abductive explanations. IB assignments assign fewer variables in abductive explanations than do schemes assigning values to all evidentially supported variables. We use IB assignments to approximate marginal probabilities in Bayesian belief networks. Recent work in belief updating for Bayes networks attempts to approximate posterior probabilities by finding a small number of the highest probability complete (or perhaps evidentially supported) assignments. Under certain assumptions, the probability mass in the union of these assignments is sufficient to obtain a good approximation. Such methods are especially useful for highly-connected networks, where the maximum clique size or the cutset size make the standard algorithms intractable. Since IB assignments contain fewer assigned variables, the probability mass in each assignment is greater than in the respective complete assignment. Thus, fewer IB assignments are sufficient, and a good approximation can be obtained more efficiently. IB assignments can be used for efficiently approximating posterior node probabilities even in cases which do not obey the rather strict skewness assumptions used in previous research. Two algorithms for finding the high probability IB assignments are suggested: one by doing a best-first heuristic search, and another by special-purpose integer linear programming. Experimental results show that this approach is feasible for highly connected belief networks.",0
"Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has improved the performance of game playing engines in domains such as Go, Hex, and general-game playing. MCTS has been shown to outperform outperform classic alpha-beta search in games where good heuristic evaluations are difficult to obtain. In recent years, combining ideas from traditional minimax search in MCTS has been shown to be advantageous in some domains, such as Lines of Action, Amazons, and Breakthrough. In this paper, we propose a new way to use heuristic evaluations to guide the MCTS search by storing the two sources of information, estimated win rates and heuristic evaluations, separately. Rather than using the heuristic evaluations to replace the playouts, our technique backs them up implicitly during its MCTS simulations. These learned evaluation values are then used to guide future simulations. Compared to current techniques, we show that using implicit minimax backups leads to stronger play performance in Breakthrough, Lines of Action, and Kalah.",0
"Performance evaluation of various organizations especially educational institutions is a very important area of research and needs to be cultivated more. In this paper, we propose a performance evaluation for educational institutions using rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces with ordering rules and information entropy. In order to measure the performance of educational institutions, we construct an evaluation index system. Rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces with ordering is applied to explore the evaluation index data of each level. Furthermore, the concept of information entropy is used to determine the weighting coefficients of evaluation indexes. Also, we find the most important indexes that influence the weighting coefficients. The proposed approach is validated and shows the practical viability. Moreover, the proposed approach can be applicable to any organizations.",0
"We study the problem of agent-based negotiation in combinatorial domains. It is difficult to reach optimal agreements in bilateral or multi-lateral negotiations when the agents' preferences for the possible alternatives are not common knowledge. Self-interested agents often end up negotiating inefficient agreements in such situations. In this paper, we present a protocol for negotiation in combinatorial domains which can lead rational agents to reach optimal agreements under incomplete information setting. Our proposed protocol enables the negotiating agents to identify efficient solutions using distributed search that visits only a small subspace of the whole outcome space. Moreover, the proposed protocol is sufficiently general that it is applicable to most preference representation models in combinatorial domains. We also present results of experiments that demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of our approach.",0
"The Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a data model providing a set of binary Boolean operators such as Union, Difference and Intersection. In this work, these operators are used to compute topological relations between objects defined by the constraints of the nine Intersection Model (9-IM) from Egenhofer. With the help of these constraints, we define a procedure to compute the topological relations on CSG objects. These topological relations are Disjoint, Contains, Inside, Covers, CoveredBy, Equals and Overlaps, and are defined in a top-level ontology with a specific semantic definition on relation such as Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Functional, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. The results of topological relations computation are stored in the ontology allowing after what to infer on these topological relationships. In addition, logic rules based on the Semantic Web Language allows the definition of logic programs that define which topological relationships have to be computed on which kind of objects. For instance, a ""Building"" that overlaps a ""Railway"" is a ""RailStation"".",0
"Human-robot interaction can be divided into two categories based on the physical distance between the human and robot: remote and proximal. In proximal interaction, the human and robot often engage in close coordination; in remote interaction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication constraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote interaction becomes more important. Thus far, human factor studies on automation in remote human-robot interaction have been restricted to various forms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as a smart mobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to facilitate peer-to-peer human-robot teaming, in which the human and robot are viewed as teammates that are physically separated. The human and robot share the same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel uncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming performance. One important difference between peer-to-peer teaming and supervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in peer-to-peer teaming can achieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified. However, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry. While information asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the robot choosing improper actions that negatively influence the teaming performance. We aim to investigate the various trade-offs, e.g., mental workload and situation awareness, between these two types of remote human-robot teaming.",0
"This paper discusses the topic of dimensionality reduction for $k$-means clustering. We prove that any set of $n$ points in $d$ dimensions (rows in a matrix $A \in \RR^{n \times d}$) can be projected into $t = \Omega(k / \eps^2)$ dimensions, for any $\eps \in (0,1/3)$, in $O(n d \lceil \eps^{-2} k/ \log(d) \rceil )$ time, such that with constant probability the optimal $k$-partition of the point set is preserved within a factor of $2+\eps$. The projection is done by post-multiplying $A$ with a $d \times t$ random matrix $R$ having entries $+1/\sqrt{t}$ or $-1/\sqrt{t}$ with equal probability. A numerical implementation of our technique and experiments on a large face images dataset verify the speed and the accuracy of our theoretical results.",1
"Computer-based information technologies have been extensively used to help many organizations, private companies, and academic and education institutions manage their processes and information systems hereby become their nervous centre. The explosion of massive data sets created by businesses, science and governments necessitates intelligent and more powerful computing paradigms so that users can benefit from this data. Therefore most new-generation database applications demand intelligent information management to enhance efficient interactions between database and the users. Database systems support only a Boolean query model. A selection query on SQL database returns all those tuples that satisfy the conditions in the query.",0
"Motivated by vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in particular Atari games from the recent benchmark Aracade Learning Environment (ALE), we consider spatio-temporal prediction problems where future (image-)frames are dependent on control variables or actions as well as previous frames. While not composed of natural scenes, frames in Atari games are high-dimensional in size, can involve tens of objects with one or more objects being controlled by the actions directly and many other objects being influenced indirectly, can involve entry and departure of objects, and can involve deep partial observability. We propose and evaluate two deep neural network architectures that consist of encoding, action-conditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures are able to generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to make and evaluate long-term predictions on high-dimensional video conditioned by control inputs.",1
"Subjective expected utility theory assumes that decision-makers possess unlimited computational resources to reason about their choices; however, virtually all decisions in everyday life are made under resource constraints - i.e. decision-makers are bounded in their rationality. Here we experimentally tested the predictions made by a formalization of bounded rationality based on ideas from statistical mechanics and information-theory. We systematically tested human subjects in their ability to solve combinatorial puzzles under different time limitations. We found that our bounded-rational model accounts well for the data. The decomposition of the fitted model parameter into the subjects' expected utility function and resource parameter provide interesting insight into the subjects' information capacity limits. Our results confirm that humans gradually fall back on their learned prior choice patterns when confronted with increasing resource limitations.",1
"Recent years have seen the development of a number of methods for multiagent planning under uncertainty that scale to tens or even hundreds of agents. However, most of these methods either make restrictive assumptions on the problem domain, or provide approximate solutions without any guarantees on quality. To allow for meaningful benchmarking through measurable quality guarantees on a very general class of problems, this paper introduces a family of influence-optimistic upper bounds for factored Dec-POMDPs. Intuitively, we derive bounds on very large multiagent planning problems by subdividing them in sub-problems, and at each of these sub-problems making optimistic assumptions with respect to the influence that will be exerted by the rest of the system. We numerically compare the different upper bounds and demonstrate how, for the first time ever, we can achieve a non-trivial guarantee that the heuristic solution of problems with hundreds of agents is close to optimal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the upper bounds may improve the effectiveness of heuristic influence search, and discuss further potential applications to multiagent planning.",0
"This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning learning algorithms. These structures also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the transitions between such abstract states. The connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or options. The skills are independent of the learning task and can be efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over a common state space. Another major advantage of the approach is that it does not need a prior model of the MDP and can work well even when the MDPs are constructed from sampled trajectories. Finally, we present our attempts to extend the automated skills acquisition framework to complex tasks such as learning to play video games where we use deep learning techniques for representation learning to aid our spatio-temporal abstraction framework.",0
"We propose a new definition of actual causes, using structural equations to model counterfactuals.We show that the definitions yield a plausible and elegant account ofcausation that handles well examples which have caused problems forother definitions and resolves major difficulties in the traditionalaccount.

"In this paper we extend our previous results on sets of graded attribute implications with witnessed non-redundancy. We assume finite residuated lattices as structures of truth degrees and use arbitrary idempotent truth-stressing linguistic hedges as parameters which influence the semantics of graded attribute implications. In this setting, we introduce algorithm which transforms any set of graded attribute implications into an equivalent non-redundant set of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents whose non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of the formulas. As a consequence, we solve the open problem regarding the existence of general systems of pseudo-intents which appear in formal concept analysis of object-attribute data with graded attributes and linguistic hedges. Furthermore, we show a polynomial-time procedure for determining bases given by general systems of pseudo-intents from sets of graded attribute implications which are complete in data.",0
"This paper explores the task of translating natural language queries into regular expressions which embody their meaning. In contrast to prior work, the proposed neural model does not utilize domain-specific crafting, learning to translate directly from a parallel corpus. To fully explore the potential of neural models, we propose a methodology for collecting a large corpus of regular expression, natural language pairs. Our resulting model achieves a performance gain of 19.6% over previous state-of-the-art models.",1
A natural language interface exploits the conceptual simplicity and naturalness of the language to create a high-level user-friendly communication channel between humans and machines. One of the promising applications of such interfaces is generating visual interpretations of semantic content of a given natural language that can be then visualized either as a static scene or a dynamic animation. This survey discusses requirements and challenges of developing such systems and reports 26 graphical systems that exploit natural language interfaces and addresses both artificial intelligence and visualization aspects. This work serves as a frame of reference to researchers and to enable further advances in the field.,0
"Nowadays, social networks became essential in information exchange between individuals. Indeed, as users of these networks, we can send messages to other people according to the links connecting us. Moreover, given the large volume of exchanged messages, detecting the true nature of the received message becomes a challenge. For this purpose, it is interesting to consider this new tendency with reasoning under uncertainty by using the theory of belief functions. In this paper, we tried to model a social network as being a network of fusion of information and determine the true nature of the received message in a well-defined node by proposing a new model: the belief social network.",0
"In this position paper, I argue that standardized tests for elementary science such as SAT or Regents tests are not very good benchmarks for measuring the progress of artificial intelligence systems in understanding basic science. The primary problem is that these tests are designed to test aspects of knowledge and ability that are challenging for people; the aspects that are challenging for AI systems are very different. In particular, standardized tests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge can be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific features that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark. I analyze the Physics subject SAT in some detail and the New York State Regents Science test more briefly. I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using standardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory. The one major real advantage is that the significance is easily explained to the public; but I argue that even this is a somewhat mixed blessing. I conclude by arguing that, first, more appropriate collections of exam style problems could be assembled, and second, that there are better kinds of benchmarks than exam-style problems. In an appendix I present a collection of sample exam-style problems that test kinds of knowledge missing from the standardized tests.",0
"Efficiently querying Description Logic (DL) ontologies is becoming a vital task in various data-intensive DL applications. Considered as a basic service for answering object queries over DL ontologies, instance checking can be realized by using the most specific concept (MSC) method, which converts instance checking into subsumption problems. This method, however, loses its simplicity and efficiency when applied to large and complex ontologies, as it tends to generate very large MSC's that could lead to intractable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a revision to this MSC method for DL SHI, allowing it to generate much simpler and smaller concepts that are specific-enough to answer a given query. With independence between computed MSC's, scalability for query answering can also be achieved by distributing and parallelizing the computations. An empirical evaluation shows the efficacy of our revised MSC method and the significant efficiency achieved when using it for answering object queries.",1
"In the context of solving large distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOP), belief-propagation and approximate inference algorithms are candidates of choice. However, in general, when the factor graph is very loopy (i.e. cyclic), these solution methods suffer from bad performance, due to non-convergence and many exchanged messages. As to improve performances of the Max-Sum inference algorithm when solving loopy constraint optimization problems, we propose here to take inspiration from the belief-propagation-guided dec-imation used to solve sparse random graphs (k-satisfiability). We propose the novel DeciMaxSum method, which is parameterized in terms of policies to decide when to trigger decimation, which variables to decimate, and which values to assign to decimated variables. Based on an empirical evaluation on a classical BP benchmark (the Ising model), some of these combinations of policies exhibit better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.",0
"This paper is a reflexion on the computability of natural language semantics. It does not contain a new model or new results in the formal semantics of natural language: it is rather a computational analysis of the logical models and algorithms currently used in natural language semantics, defined as the mapping of a statement to logical formulas - formulas, because a statement can be ambiguous. We argue that as long as possible world semantics is left out, one can compute the semantic representation(s) of a given statement, including aspects of lexical meaning. We also discuss the algorithmic complexity of this process.",0
"Variable or value elimination in a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be used in preprocessing or during search to reduce search space size. A variable elimination rule (value elimination rule) allows the polynomial-time identification of certain variables (domain elements) whose elimination, without the introduction of extra compensatory constraints, does not affect the satisfiability of an instance. We show that there are essentially just four variable elimination rules and three value elimination rules defined by forbidding generic sub-instances, known as irreducible existential patterns, in arc-consistent CSP instances. One of the variable elimination rules is the already-known Broken Triangle Property, whereas the other three are novel. The three value elimination rules can all be seen as strict generalisations of neighbourhood substitution.",0
"Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data for their parameter estimation and are therefore usually learned on large corpora such as chat forums or movie subtitles. These corpora are, however, often challenging to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn segmentation and the presence of multiple references external to the dialogue itself. This paper shows that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a weighting model into the architecture. The weighting model, which is itself estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be minimised. Evaluation results on retrieval-based models trained on movie and TV subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting model improves the model performance on unsupervised metrics.",0
"We give an axiomatization of confidence transfer - a known conditioning scheme - from the perspective of expectation-based inference in the sense of Gardenfors and Makinson. Then, we use the notion of belief independence to ""filter out"" different proposal s of possibilistic conditioning rules, all are variations of confidence transfer. Among the three rules that we consider, only Dempster's rule of conditioning passes the test of supporting the notion of belief independence. With the use of this conditioning rule, we then show that we can use local computation for computing desired conditional marginal possibilities of the joint possibility satisfying the given constraints. It turns out that our local computation scheme is already proposed by Shenoy. However, our intuitions are completely different from that of Shenoy. While Shenoy just defines a local computation scheme that fits his framework of valuation-based systems, we derive that local computation scheme from II(,8) = tI(,8 I a) * II(a) and appropriate independence assumptions, just like how the Bayesians derive their local computation scheme.",0
"The rise of smart applications has drawn interest to logical reasoning over data streams. Recently, different query languages and stream processing/reasoning engines were proposed in different communities. However, due to a lack of theoretical foundations, the expressivity and semantics of these diverse approaches are given only informally. Towards clear specifications and means for analytic study, a formal framework is needed to define their semantics in precise terms. To this end, we present a first step towards an ideal semantics that allows for exact descriptions and comparisons of stream reasoning systems.",0
"CoCoE stands for Complexity, Coherence and Entropy, and presents an extensible methodology for empirical analysis of Linked Open Data (i.e., RDF graphs). CoCoE can offer answers to questions like: Is dataset A better than B for knowledge discovery since it is more complex and informative?, Is dataset X better than Y for simple value lookups due its flatter structure?, etc. In order to address such questions, we introduce a set of well-founded measures based on complementary notions from distributional semantics, network analysis and information theory. These measures are part of a specific implementation of the CoCoE methodology that is available for download. Last but not least, we illustrate CoCoE by its application to selected biomedical RDF datasets.",0

"Dribbling an opponent player in digital soccer environment is an important practical problem in motion planning. It has special complexities which can be generalized to most important problems in other similar Multi Agent Systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid computational geometry and evolutionary computation approach for generating motion trajectories to avoid a mobile obstacle. In this case an opponent agent is not only an obstacle but also one who tries to harden dribbling procedure. One characteristic of this approach is reducing process cost of online stage by transferring it to offline stage which causes increment in agents' performance. This approach breaks the problem into two offline and online stages. During offline stage the goal is to find desired trajectory using evolutionary computation and saving it as a trajectory plan. A trajectory plan consists of nodes which approximate information of each trajectory plan. In online stage, a linear interpolation along with Delaunay triangulation in xy-plan is applied to trajectory plan to retrieve desired action.",0
"Multiple hypothesis testing is a significant problem in nearly all neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known Bonferroni correction method, while simple to implement, is quite conservative, and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact, non-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given $\alpha$-threshold, but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive. In this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating the columns of a very large matrix ${\bf P}$. By analyzing the spectrum of this matrix, under certain conditions, we see that ${\bf P}$ has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly sub--sampled --- on the order of $0.5\%$ --- matrix completion methods. Based on this observation, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which offers a large speedup, without sacrificing the fidelity of the estimated FWER. Our evaluations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a computational speedup factor of roughly $50\times$ can be achieved while recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show that the estimated $\alpha$-threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is stable.",1
"A difficult task in modeling with Bayesian networks is the elicitation of numerical parameters of Bayesian networks. A large number of parameters is needed to specify a conditional probability table (CPT) that has a larger parent set. In this paper we show that, most CPTs from real applications of Bayesian networks can actually be very well approximated by tables that require substantially less parameters. This observation has practical consequence not only for model elicitation but also for efficient probabilistic reasoning with these networks.",0
"There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying given constraints. Such problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of their solutions. This paper introduces effective and compact, complete symmetry breaking constraints for small graph search. Enumerating with these symmetry breaks generates all and only non-isomorphic solutions. For small search problems, with up to $10$ vertices, we compute instance independent symmetry breaking constraints. For small search problems with a larger number of vertices we demonstrate the computation of instance dependent constraints which are complete. We illustrate the application of complete symmetry breaking constraints to extend two known sequences from the OEIS related to graph numeration.",0
"The inherent inflexibility and incompleteness of commonsense knowledge bases (KB) has limited their usefulness. We describe a system called Displacer for performing KB queries extended with the analogical capabilities of the word2vec distributional semantic vector space (DSVS). This allows the system to answer queries with information which was not contained in the original KB in any form. By performing analogous queries on semantically related terms and mapping their answers back into the context of the original query using displacement vectors, we are able to give approximate answers to many questions which, if posed to the KB alone, would return no results.",0
"During the last years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. Their architectures have largely drawn inspiration by models of the primate visual system. However, while recent research results of neuroscience prove the existence of non-linear operations in the response of complex visual cells, little effort has been devoted to extend the convolution technique to non-linear forms. Typical convolutional layers are linear systems, hence their expressiveness is limited. To overcome this, various non-linearities have been used as activation functions inside CNNs, while also many pooling strategies have been applied. We address the issue of developing a convolution method in the context of a computational model of the visual cortex, exploring quadratic forms through the Volterra kernels. Such forms, constituting a more rich function space, are used as approximations of the response profile of visual cells. Our proposed second-order convolution is tested on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that a network which combines linear and non-linear filters in its convolutional layers, can outperform networks that use standard linear filters with the same architecture, yielding results competitive with the state-of-the-art on these datasets.",0
"The Bayesian approach to machine learning amounts to computing posterior distributions of random variables from a probabilistic model of how the variables are related (that is, a prior distribution) and a set of observations of variables. There is a trend in machine learning towards expressing Bayesian models as probabilistic programs. As a foundation for this kind of programming, we propose a core functional calculus with primitives for sampling prior distributions and observing variables. We define measure-transformer combinators inspired by theorems in measure theory, and use these to give a rigorous semantics to our core calculus. The original features of our semantics include its support for discrete, continuous, and hybrid measures, and, in particular, for observations of zero-probability events. We compile our core language to a small imperative language that is processed by an existing inference engine for factor graphs, which are data structures that enable many efficient inference algorithms. This allows efficient approximate inference of posterior marginal distributions, treating thousands of observations per second for large instances of realistic models.",0
"A conceptual foundation for approximation of belief functions is proposed and investigated. It is based on the requirements of consistency and closeness. An optimal approximation is studied. Unfortunately, the computation of the optimal approximation turns out to be intractable. Hence, various heuristic methods are proposed and experimantally evaluated both in terms of their accuracy and in terms of the speed of computation. These methods are compared to the earlier proposed approximations of belief functions.",0
"Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy. While these attributes may be acquired naturally by human players, teaching them to a computer program is a far more challenging task. In recent years, extensive research was carried out in the field of reinforcement learning and numerous algorithms were introduced, aiming to learn how to perform human tasks such as playing video games. As a results, the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) has become a commonly used benchmark environment allowing algorithms to train on various Atari 2600 games. Most Atari games no longer pose a challenge to state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper we introduce a new learning environment, the Retro Learning Environment --- RLE, based on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The environment is expandable, allowing for more video games and consoles to be easily added to the environment, while maintaining the same interface as ALE. Moreover, RLE is compatible with Python and Torch. SNES games pose a significant challenge to current algorithms due to their higher level of complexity and versatility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training method based on training two agents against each other.",0
"Among the local consistency techniques used for solving constraint networks, path-consistency (PC) has received a great deal of attention. However, enforcing PC is computationally expensive and sometimes even unnecessary. Directional path-consistency (DPC) is a weaker notion of PC that considers a given variable ordering and can thus be enforced more efficiently than PC. This paper shows that DPC (the DPC enforcing algorithm of Dechter and Pearl) decides the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of a constraint language if it is complete and has the variable elimination property (VEP). However, we also show that no complete VEP constraint language can have a domain with more than 2 values. We then present a simple variant of the DPC algorithm, called DPC*, and show that the CSP of a constraint language can be decided by DPC* if it is closed under a majority operation. In fact, DPC* is sufficient for guaranteeing backtrack-free search for such constraint networks. Examples of majority-closed constraint classes include the classes of connected row-convex (CRC) constraints and tree-preserving constraints, which have found applications in various domains, such as scene labeling, temporal reasoning, geometric reasoning, and logical filtering. Our experimental evaluations show that DPC* significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving majority-closed constraints.",0
"Networks are models representing relationships between entities. Often these relationships are explicitly given, or we must learn a representation which generalizes and predicts observed behavior in underlying individual data (e.g. attributes or labels). Whether given or inferred, choosing the best representation affects subsequent tasks and questions on the network. This work focuses on model selection to evaluate network representations from data, focusing on fundamental predictive tasks on networks. We present a modular methodology using general, interpretable network models, task neighborhood functions found across domains, and several criteria for robust model selection. We demonstrate our methodology on three online user activity datasets and show that network model selection for the appropriate network task vs. an alternate task increases performance by an order of magnitude in our experiments.",0
"Vector quantization(VQ) is a lossy data compression technique from signal processing, which is restricted to feature vectors and therefore inapplicable for combinatorial structures. This contribution presents a theoretical foundation of graph quantization (GQ) that extends VQ to the domain of attributed graphs. We present the necessary Lloyd-Max conditions for optimality of a graph quantizer and consistency results for optimal GQ design based on empirical distortion measures and stochastic optimization. These results statistically justify existing clustering algorithms in the domain of graphs. The proposed approach provides a template of how to link structural pattern recognition methods other than GQ to statistical pattern recognition.",0
"Instance-specific algorithm configuration and algorithm portfolios have been shown to offer significant improvements over single algorithm approaches in a variety of application domains. In the SAT and CSP domains algorithm portfolios have consistently dominated the main competitions in these fields for the past five years. For a portfolio approach to be effective there are two crucial conditions that must be met. First, there needs to be a collection of complementary solvers with which to make a portfolio. Second, there must be a collection of problem features that can accurately identify structural differences between instances. This paper focuses on the latter issue: feature representation, because, unlike SAT, not every problem has well-studied features. We employ the well-known SATzilla feature set, but compute alternative sets on different SAT encodings of CSPs. We show that regardless of what encoding is used to convert the instances, adequate structural information is maintained to differentiate between problem instances, and that this can be exploited to make an effective portfolio-based CSP solver.",0
"Reinforcement learning can acquire complex behaviors from high-level specifications. However, defining a cost function that can be optimized effectively and encodes the correct task is challenging in practice. We explore how inverse optimal control (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from demonstrations, with applications to torque control of high-dimensional robotic systems. Our method addresses two key challenges in inverse optimal control: first, the need for informative features and effective regularization to impose structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning the cost function under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems. To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering. To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient sample-based approximation for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series of simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior methods both in terms of task complexity and sample efficiency.",1
"Computer-supported learning is an increasingly important form of study since it allows for independent learning and individualized instruction. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to developing an intelligent tutoring system for teaching textbook-style mathematical proofs. We characterize the particularities of the domain and discuss common ITS design models. Our approach is motivated by phenomena found in a corpus of tutorial dialogs that were collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. We show how an intelligent tutor for textbook-style mathematical proofs can be built on top of an adapted assertion-level proof assistant by reusing representations and proof search strategies originally developed for automated and interactive theorem proving. The resulting prototype was successfully evaluated on a corpus of tutorial dialogs and yields good results.",0
"We argue for the value of publishing the exact code, configuration and data processing scripts used to produce empirical work in robotics. In particular, we recommend publishing a unique identifier for the code package in the paper itself, as a promise to the reader that this is the relavant code. We review some recent discussion of best practice for reproducibility in various professional organisations and journals, and discuss the current reward structure for publishing code in robotics, along with some ideas for improvement.",0
"We introduce a stepping methodology for answer-set programming (ASP) that allows for debugging answer-set programs and is based on the stepwise application of rules. Similar to debugging in imperative languages, where the behaviour of a program is observed during a step-by-step execution, stepping for ASP allows for observing the effects that rule applications have in the computation of an answer set. While the approach is inspired from debugging in imperative programming, it is conceptually different to stepping in other paradigms due to non-determinism and declarativity that are inherent to ASP. In particular, unlike statements in an imperative program that are executed following a strict control flow, there is no predetermined order in which to consider rules in ASP during a computation. In our approach, the user is free to decide which rule to consider active in the next step following his or her intuition. This way, one can focus on interesting parts of the debugging search space. Bugs are detected during stepping by revealing differences between the actual semantics of the program and the expectations of the user. As a solid formal basis for stepping, we develop a framework of computations for answer-set programs. For fully supporting different solver languages, we build our framework on an abstract ASP language that is sufficiently general to capture different solver languages. To this end, we make use of abstract constraints as an established abstraction for popular language constructs such as aggregates. Stepping has been implemented in SeaLion, an integrated development environment for ASP. We illustrate stepping using an example scenario and discuss the stepping plugin of SeaLion. Moreover, we elaborate on methodological aspects and the embedding of stepping in the ASP development process.",0
"In this paper we proposed reinforcement learning algorithms with the generalized reward function. In our proposed method we use Q-learning and SARSA algorithms with generalised reward function to train the reinforcement learning agent. We evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithms on two real-time strategy games called BattleCity and S3. There are two main advantages of having such an approach as compared to other works in RTS. (1) We can ignore the concept of a simulator which is often game specific and is usually hard coded in any type of RTS games (2) our system can learn from interaction with any opponents and quickly change the strategy according to the opponents and do not need any human traces as used in previous works. Keywords : Reinforcement learning, Machine learning, Real time strategy, Artificial intelligence.",0
"This work shows that policies with simple linear and RBF parameterizations can be trained to solve a variety of continuous control tasks, including the OpenAI gym benchmarks. The performance of these trained policies are competitive with state of the art results, obtained with more elaborate parameterizations such as fully connected neural networks. Furthermore, existing training and testing scenarios are shown to be very limited and prone to over-fitting, thus giving rise to only trajectory-centric policies. Training with a diverse initial state distribution is shown to produce more global policies with better generalization. This allows for interactive control scenarios where the system recovers from large on-line perturbations; as shown in the supplementary video.",1
"The payload of communications satellites must go through a series of tests to assert their ability to survive in space. Each test involves some equipment of the payload to be active, which has an impact on the temperature of the payload. Sequencing these tests in a way that ensures the thermal stability of the payload and minimizes the overall duration of the test campaign is a very important objective for satellite manufacturers. The problem can be decomposed in two sub-problems corresponding to two objectives: First, the number of distinct configurations necessary to run the tests must be minimized. This can be modeled as packing the tests into configurations, and we introduce a set of implied constraints to improve the lower bound of the model. Second, tests must be sequenced so that the number of times an equipment unit has to be switched on or off is minimized. We model this aspect using the constraint Switch, where a buffer with limited capacity represents the currently active equipment units, and we introduce an improvement of the propagation algorithm for this constraint. We then introduce a search strategy in which we sequentially solve the sub-problems (packing and sequencing). Experiments conducted on real and random instances show the respective interest of our contributions.",0
"This paper describes a Bayesian method for learning causal networks using samples that were selected in a non-random manner from a population of interest. Examples of data obtained by non-random sampling include convenience samples and case-control data in which a fixed number of samples with and without some condition is collected; such data are not uncommon. The paper describes a method for combining data under selection with prior beliefs in order to derive a posterior probability for a model of the causal processes that are generating the data in the population of interest. The priors include beliefs about the nature of the non-random sampling procedure. Although exact application of the method would be computationally intractable for most realistic datasets, efficient special-case and approximation methods are discussed. Finally, the paper describes how to combine learning under selection with previous methods for learning from observational and experimental data that are obtained on random samples of the population of interest. The net result is a Bayesian methodology that supports causal modeling and discovery from a rich mixture of different types of data.",0
"The increase of connectivity and the impact it has in every day life is raising new and existing security problems that are becoming important for social good. We introduce two particular problems: cyber attack attribution and regulatory data sharing. For both problems, decisions about which rules to apply, should be taken under incomplete and context dependent information. The solution we propose is based on argumentation reasoning, that is a well suited technique for implementing decision making mechanisms under conflicting and incomplete information. Our proposal permits us to identify the attacker of a cyber attack and decide the regulation rule that should be used while using and sharing data. We illustrate our solution through concrete examples.",0
"The gossip problem, in which information (known as secrets) must be shared among a certain number of agents using the minimum number of calls, is of interest in the conception of communication networks and protocols. We extend the gossip problem to arbitrary epistemic depths. For example, we may require not only that all agents know all secrets but also that all agents know that all agents know all secrets. We give optimal protocols for various versions of the generalised gossip problem, depending on the graph of communication links, in the case of two-way communications, one-way communications and parallel communication. We also study different variants which allow us to impose negative goals such as that certain agents must not know certain secrets. We show that in the presence of negative goals testing the existence of a successful protocol is NP-complete whereas this is always polynomial-time in the case of purely positive goals.",0
"In action domains where agents may have erroneous beliefs, reasoning about the effects of actions involves reasoning about belief change. In this paper, we use a transition system approach to reason about the evolution of an agents beliefs as actions are executed. Some actions cause an agent to perform belief revision while others cause an agent to perform belief update, but the interaction between revision and update can be non-elementary. We present a set of rationality properties describing the interaction between revision and update, and we introduce a new class of belief change operators for reasoning about alternating sequences of revisions and updates. Our belief change operators can be characterized in terms of a natural shifting operation on total pre-orderings over interpretations. We compare our approach with related work on iterated belief change due to action, and we conclude with some directions for future research.",0
"Leadership is an important aspect of social organization that affects the processes of group formation, coordination, and decision-making in human societies, as well as in the social system of many other animal species. The ability to identify leaders based on their behavior and the subsequent reactions of others opens opportunities to explore how group decisions are made. Understanding who exerts influence provides key insights into the structure of social organizations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful leadership inference framework extracting group coordination periods and determining leadership based on the activity of individuals within a group. We are able to not only identify a leader or leaders but also classify the type of leadership model that is consistent with observed patterns of group decision-making. The framework performs well in differentiating a variety of leadership models (e.g. dictatorship, linear hierarchy, or local influence). We propose five simple features that can be used to categorize characteristics of each leadership model, and thus make model classification possible. The proposed approach automatically (1) identifies periods of coordinated group activity, (2) determines the identities of leaders, and (3) classifies the likely mechanism by which the group coordination occurred. We demonstrate our framework on both simulated and real-world data: GPS tracks of a baboon troop and video-tracking of fish schools, as well as stock market closing price data of the NASDAQ index. The results of our leadership model are consistent with ground-truthed biological data and the framework finds many known events in financial data which are not otherwise reflected in the aggregate NASDAQ index. Our approach is easily generalizable to any coordinated activity data from interacting entities.",0
"In this work, we present a MCTS-based Go-playing program which uses convolutional networks in all parts. Our method performs MCTS in batches, explores the Monte Carlo search tree using Thompson sampling and a convolutional network, and evaluates convnet-based rollouts on the GPU. We achieve strong win rates against open source Go programs and attain competitive results against state of the art convolutional net-based Go-playing programs.",0
"We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from a noisy observation. Previous work has shown $O(n^{\lceil K/2\rceil/2})$ recovery guarantee for recovering a $K$th order rank one tensor of size $n\times ...\times n$ by an algorithm called recursive unfolding. In this paper, we first improve this to $O(n^{K/4})$ by a much simpler approach but with a more careful analysis. Then we propose a new norm based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator. The imposed Kronecker structure of the new norm allows us to show a nearly ideal $O(\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{m})$ bound for the proposed subspace norm, in which the parameter $m$ controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization. Furthermore we empirically demonstrate that with $m=O(1)$, the proposed norm achieves near ideal denoising performance.",1
"The paper evaluates the power of best-first search over AND/OR search spaces for solving the Most Probable Explanation (MPE) task in Bayesian networks. The main virtue of the AND/OR representation of the search space is its sensitivity to the structure of the problem, which can translate into significant time savings. In recent years depth-first AND/OR Branch-and- Bound algorithms were shown to be very effective when exploring such search spaces, especially when using caching. Since best-first strategies are known to be superior to depth-first when memory is utilized, exploring the best-first control strategy is called for. The main contribution of this paper is in showing that a recent extension of AND/OR search algorithms from depth-first Branch-and-Bound to best-first is indeed very effective for computing the MPE in Bayesian networks. We demonstrate empirically the superiority of the best-first search approach on various probabilistic networks.",0
"We introduce a challenging real-world planning problem where actions must be taken at each location in a spatial area at each point in time. We use forestry planning as the motivating application. In Large Scale Spatial-Temporal (LSST) planning problems, the state and action spaces are defined as the cross-products of many local state and action spaces spread over a large spatial area such as a city or forest. These problems possess state uncertainty, have complex utility functions involving spatial constraints and we generally must rely on simulations rather than an explicit transition model. We define LSST problems as reinforcement learning problems and present a solution using policy gradients. We compare two different policy formulations: an explicit policy that identifies each location in space and the action to take there; and an abstract policy that defines the proportion of actions to take across all locations in space. We show that the abstract policy is more robust and achieves higher rewards with far fewer parameters than the elementary policy. This abstract policy is also a better fit to the properties that practitioners in LSST problem domains require for such methods to be widely useful.",0
"We present three results on the complexity of Minimax Approval Voting. First, we study Minimax Approval Voting parameterized by the Hamming distance $d$ from the solution to the votes. We show Minimax Approval Voting admits no algorithm running in time $\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{o(d\log d)})$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. This means that the $\mathcal{O}^\star(d^{2d})$ algorithm of Misra et al. [AAMAS 2015] is essentially optimal. Motivated by this, we then show a parameterized approximation scheme, running in time $\mathcal{O}^\star(\left({3}/{\epsilon}\right)^{2d})$, which is essentially tight assuming ETH. Finally, we get a new polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme for Minimax Approval Voting, which runs in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2 \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(m)$, almost matching the running time of the fastest known PTAS for Closest String due to Ma and Sun [SIAM J. Comp. 2009].",1
"Penetration Testing is a methodology for assessing network security, by generating and executing possible attacks. Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing without a prohibitive amount of human labor. A key question then is how to generate the attacks. This is naturally formulated as a planning problem. Previous work (Lucangeli et al. 2010) used classical planning and hence ignores all the incomplete knowledge that characterizes hacking. More recent work (Sarraute et al. 2011) makes strong independence assumptions for the sake of scaling, and lacks a clear formal concept of what the attack planning problem actually is. Herein, we model that problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This grounds penetration testing in a well-researched formalism, highlighting important aspects of this problem's nature. POMDPs allow to model information gathering as an integral part of the problem, thus providing for the first time a means to intelligently mix scanning actions with actual exploits.",0
"Graph coloring, also known as vertex coloring, considers the problem of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The optimization version of the problem concerns the minimization of the number of used colors. In this paper we deal with the problem of finding valid colorings of graphs in a distributed way, that is, by means of an algorithm that only uses local information for deciding the color of the nodes. Such algorithms prescind from any central control. Due to the fact that quite a few practical applications require to find colorings in a distributed way, the interest in distributed algorithms for graph coloring has been growing during the last decade. As an example consider wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks, where tasks such as the assignment of frequencies or the assignment of TDMA slots are strongly related to graph coloring.",0
"Organic Computing is an initiative in the field of systems engineering that proposed to make use of concepts such as self-adaptation and self-organisation to increase the robustness of technical systems. Based on the observation that traditional design and operation concepts reach their limits, transferring more autonomy to the systems themselves should result in a reduction of complexity for users, administrators, and developers. However, there seems to be a need for an updated definition of the term ""Organic Computing"", of desired properties of technical, organic systems, and the objectives of the Organic Computing initiative. With this article, we will address these points.",0
"The recent outburst of context-dependent knowledge on the Semantic Web (SW) has led to the realization of the importance of the quads in the SW community. Quads, which extend a standard RDF triple, by adding a new parameter of the `context' of an RDF triple, thus informs a reasoner to distinguish between the knowledge in various contexts. Although this distinction separates the triples in an RDF graph into various contexts, and allows the reasoning to be decoupled across various contexts, bridge rules need to be provided for inter-operating the knowledge across these contexts. We call a set of quads together with the bridge rules, a quad-system. In this paper, we discuss the problem of query answering over quad-systems with expressive forall-existential bridge rules. It turns out the query answering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We derive a decidable class of quad-systems, namely context-acyclic quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward chaining. Tight bounds for data and combined complexity of query entailment has been established for the derived class.",0
"Poker is a family of card games that includes many variations. We hypothesize that most poker games can be solved as a pattern matching problem, and propose creating a strong poker playing system based on a unified poker representation. Our poker player learns through iterative self-play, and improves its understanding of the game by training on the results of its previous actions without sophisticated domain knowledge. We evaluate our system on three poker games: single player video poker, two-player Limit Texas Hold'em, and finally two-player 2-7 triple draw poker. We show that our model can quickly learn patterns in these very different poker games while it improves from zero knowledge to a competitive player against human experts.",0
"We consider the problem of approximate belief-state monitoring using particle filtering for the purposes of implementing a policy for a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP). While particle filtering has become a widely-used tool in AI for monitoring dynamical systems, rather scant attention has been paid to their use in the context of decision making. Assuming the existence of a value function, we derive error bounds on decision quality associated with filtering using importance sampling. We also describe an adaptive procedure that can be used to dynamically determine the number of samples required to meet specific error bounds. Empirical evidence is offered supporting this technique as a profitable means of directing sampling effort where it is needed to distinguish policies.",0
"Ontologies usually suffer from the semantic heterogeneity when simultaneously used in information sharing, merging, integrating and querying processes. Therefore, the similarity identification between ontologies being used becomes a mandatory task for all these processes to handle the problem of semantic heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique for similarity measurement between two ontologies. The proposed technique identifies all candidate pairs of similar concepts without omitting any similar pair. The proposed technique can be used in different types of operations on ontologies such as merging, mapping and aligning. By analyzing its results a reasonable improvement in terms of completeness, correctness and overall quality of the results has been found.",0
"This document is a thesis on the subject of single-agent on-line path planning in continuous,unpredictable and highly dynamic environments. The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path for a holonomic robot, without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries. The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is assumed.",0
"We introduce two novel non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests. The first test, called the relative test of dependency, enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The second test, called the relative test of similarity, is use to determine which of the two samples from arbitrary distributions is significantly closer to a reference sample of interest and the relative measure of similarity is based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). To construct these tests, we have used as our test statistics the difference of HSIC statistics and of MMD statistics, respectively. The resulting tests are consistent and unbiased, and have favorable convergence properties. The effectiveness of the relative dependency test is demonstrated on several real-world problems: we identify languages groups from a multilingual parallel corpus, and we show that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression than chromosome imbalance. We also demonstrate the performance of the relative test of similarity over a broad selection of model comparisons problems in deep generative models.",0
"Among the well-established methods for facial landmark detection is the family of Constrained Local Models (CLMs). An important part of CLM landmark alignment pipeline are the local detectors that estimate the alignment probability of each individual landmark over the facial region. In this paper we present Deep Constrained Local Model (DCLM) algorithm and the novel Dense-Projection Network (DPN) as a local detector. DPN is a deep neural network that consists of two important layers: Template Projection layer and Dense Aggregate layer. In Template Projection layer, patches of facial region are mapped to a higher dimensional space allowing the pose and rotation variations to be captured accurately. In Dense Aggregate layer an ensemble of experts is simulated within one network to make the landmark localization task more robust. In our extensive set of experiments we show that DPNs outperform previously proposed local detectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed DCLM algorithm is state-of-the-art in facial landmark detection. We significantly outperform competitive baselines, that use both CLM-based and cascaded regression approaches, by a large margin on three publicly-available datasets for image and video landmark detection.",0
A simplified description of Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation) is presented.

"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) can acquire complex behaviors from low-level inputs, such as images. However, real-world applications of such methods require generalizing to the vast variability of the real world. Deep networks are known to achieve remarkable generalization when provided with massive amounts of labeled data, but can we provide this breadth of experience to an RL agent, such as a robot? The robot might continuously learn as it explores the world around it, even while deployed. However, this learning requires access to a reward function, which is often hard to measure in real-world domains, where the reward could depend on, for example, unknown positions of objects or the emotional state of the user. Conversely, it is often quite practical to provide the agent with reward functions in a limited set of situations, such as when a human supervisor is present or in a controlled setting. Can we make use of this limited supervision, and still benefit from the breadth of experience an agent might collect on its own? In this paper, we formalize this problem as semisupervised reinforcement learning, where the reward function can only be evaluated in a set of ""labeled"" MDPs, and the agent must generalize its behavior to the wide range of states it might encounter in a set of ""unlabeled"" MDPs, by using experience from both settings. Our proposed method infers the task objective in the unlabeled MDPs through an algorithm that resembles inverse RL, using the agent's own prior experience in the labeled MDPs as a kind of demonstration of optimal behavior. We evaluate our method on challenging tasks that require control directly from images, and show that our approach can improve the generalization of a learned deep neural network policy by using experience for which no reward function is available. We also show that our method outperforms direct supervised learning of the reward.",1
"Common wisdom has it that small distinctions in the probabilities (parameters) quantifying a belief network do not matter much for the results of probabilistic queries. Yet, one can develop realistic scenarios under which small variations in network parameters can lead to significant changes in computed queries. A pending theoretical question is then to analytically characterize parameter changes that do or do not matter. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of probabilistic queries to changes in network parameters and prove some tight bounds on the impact that such parameters can have on queries. Our analytic results pinpoint some interesting situations under which parameter changes do or do not matter. These results are important for knowledge engineers as they help them identify influential network parameters. They also help explain some of the previous experimental results and observations with regards to network robustness against parameter changes.",0
"Studies on microscopic pedestrian requires large amounts of trajectory data from real-world pedestrian crowds. Such data collection, if done manually, needs tremendous effort and is very time consuming. Though many studies have asserted the possibility of automating this task using video cameras, we found that only a few have demonstrated good performance in very crowded situations or from a top-angled view scene. This paper deals with tracking pedestrian crowd under heavy occlusions from an angular scene. Our automated tracking system consists of two modules that perform sequentially. The first module detects moving objects as blobs. The second module is a tracking system. We employ probability distribution from the detection of each pedestrian and use Bayesian update to track the next position. The result of such tracking is a database of pedestrian trajectories over time and space. With certain prior information, we showed that the system can track a large number of people under occlusion and clutter scene.",0
"Kidney exchange is a barter market where patients trade willing but medically incompatible donors. These trades occur via cycles, where each patient-donor pair both gives and receives a kidney, and via chains, which begin with an altruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return. For logistical reasons, the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a small constant, while chains can be much longer. Given a compatibility graph of patient-donor pairs, altruists, and feasible potential transplants between them, finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles and chains is NP-hard. There has been much work on developing provably optimal solvers that are efficient in practice. One of the leading techniques has been branch and price, where column generation is used to incrementally bring cycles and chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis. In particular, only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model. We prove that finding a positive-price chain is NP-complete. This shows incorrectness of two leading branch-and-price solvers that suggested polynomial-time chain pricing algorithms.",0
"In this paper we show how the combination of Behaviour Tree and Utility Based AI architecture can be used to design more realistic bots for Military Simulators. In this work, we have designed a mathematical model of a simulator system which in turn helps in analyzing the results and finding out the various spaces on which our favorable situation might exist, this is done geometrically. In the mathematical model, we have explained the matrix formation and its significance followed up in dynamic programming approach we explained the possible graph formation which will led improvisation of AI, latter we explained the possible geometrical structure of the matrix operations and its impact on a particular decision, we also explained the conditions under which it tend to fail along with a possible solution in future works.",0
"Logs of the interactions with a search engine show that users often reformulate their queries. Examining these reformulations shows that recommendations that precise the focus of a query are helpful, like those based on expansions of the original queries. But it also shows that queries that express some topical shift with respect to the original query can help user access more rapidly the information they need. We propose a method to identify from the query logs of past users queries that either focus or shift the initial query topic. This method combines various click-based, topic-based and session based ranking strategies and uses supervised learning in order to maximize the semantic similarities between the query and the recommendations, while at the same diversifying them. We evaluate our method using the query/click logs of a Japanese web search engine and we show that the combination of the three methods proposed is significantly better than any of them taken individually.",0
"This paper contains analysis and extension of exploiters-based knowledge extraction methods, which allow generation of new knowledge, based on the basic ones. The main achievement of the paper is useful features of some universal exploiters proof, which allow extending set of basic classes and set of basic relations by finite set of new classes of objects and relations among them, which allow creating of complete lattice. Proposed approach gives an opportunity to compute quantity of new classes, which can be generated using it, and quantity of different types, which each of obtained classes describes; constructing of defined hierarchy of classes with determined subsumption relation; avoidance of some problems of inheritance and more efficient restoring of basic knowledge within the database.",0
"We present a probabilistic extension of the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ for reasoning about statistical knowledge. We consider conditional statements over proportions of the domain and are interested in the probabilistic-logical consequences of these proportions. After introducing some general reasoning problems and analyzing their properties, we present first algorithms and complexity results for reasoning in some fragments of Statistical $\mathcal{ALC}$.",0
"Coins are integral part of our day to day life. We use coins everywhere like grocery store, banks, buses, trains etc. So it becomes a basic need that coins can be sorted and counted automatically. For this it is necessary that coins can be recognized automatically. In this paper we have developed an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) based Automated Coin Recognition System for the recognition of Indian Coins of denomination Rs. 1, 2, 5 and 10 with rotation invariance. We have taken images from both sides of coin. So this system is capable of recognizing coins from both sides. Features are extracted from images using techniques of Hough Transformation, Pattern Averaging etc. Then, the extracted features are passed as input to a trained Neural Network. 97.74% recognition rate has been achieved during the experiments i.e. only 2.26% miss recognition, which is quite encouraging.",0
"In this paper we study lifted inference for the Weighted First-Order Model Counting problem (WFOMC), which counts the assignments that satisfy a given sentence in first-order logic (FOL); it has applications in Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and Probabilistic Databases (PDB). We present several results. First, we describe a lifted inference algorithm that generalizes prior approaches in SRL and PDB. Second, we provide a novel dichotomy result for a non-trivial fragment of FO CNF sentences, showing that for each sentence the WFOMC problem is either in PTIME or #P-hard in the size of the input domain; we prove that, in the first case our algorithm solves the WFOMC problem in PTIME, and in the second case it fails. Third, we present several properties of the algorithm. Finally, we discuss limitations of lifted inference for symmetric probabilistic databases (where the weights of ground literals depend only on the relation name, and not on the constants of the domain), and prove the impossibility of a dichotomy result for the complexity of probabilistic inference for the entire language FOL.",0
"Once known to be used exclusively in military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have stepped up to become a part of new logistic method in commercial sector called ""last-mile delivery"". In this novel approach, small UAVs, also known as drones, are deployed in tandem with the trucks to deliver goods to customers. Under research context, it gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), of which we call TSP with drone (TSP-D). In this paper, we propose two heuristics: route first - cluster second, and cluster first - route second, to solve the problem efficiently. A new mixed integer programming formulation is also introduced to handle the cluster step in both heuristics. We conduct an experiment, adapting different profit functions of the MIP model, in both heuristics, to many instances with different sizes and characteristics. The numerical analysis shows not only a significant savings compare to truck-only delivery but also a superior performance against the previous work.",0
The analysis of online least squares estimation is at the heart of many stochastic sequential decision making problems. We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale. We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate.,0
"This paper introduces and studies a declarative framework for updating views over indefinite databases. An indefinite database is a database with null values that are represented, following the standard database approach, by a single null constant. The paper formalizes views over such databases as indefinite deductive databases, and defines for them several classes of database repairs that realize view-update requests. Most notable is the class of constrained repairs. Constrained repairs change the database ""minimally"" and avoid making arbitrary commitments. They narrow down the space of alternative ways to fulfill the view-update request to those that are grounded, in a certain strong sense, in the database, the view and the view-update request.",0
"We describe a framework and an algorithm for solving hybrid influence diagrams with discrete, continuous, and deterministic chance variables, and discrete and continuous decision variables. A continuous chance variable in an influence diagram is said to be deterministic if its conditional distributions have zero variances. The solution algorithm is an extension of Shenoy's fusion algorithm for discrete influence diagrams. We describe an extended Shenoy-Shafer architecture for propagation of discrete, continuous, and utility potentials in hybrid influence diagrams that include deterministic chance variables. The algorithm and framework are illustrated by solving two small examples.",0
"Collaborative human activities are grounded in social and moral norms, which humans consciously and subconsciously use to guide and constrain their decision-making and behavior, thereby strengthening their interactions and preventing emotional and physical harm. This type of norm-based processing is also critical for robots in many human-robot interaction scenarios (e.g., when helping elderly and disabled persons in assisted living facilities, or assisting humans in assembly tasks in factories or even the space station). In this position paper, we will briefly describe how several components in an integrated cognitive architecture can be used to implement processes that are required for normative human-robot interactions, especially in collaborative tasks where actions and situations could potentially be perceived as threatening and thus need a change in course of action to mitigate the perceived threats.",0
"We describe a representation of a scene that captures geometric and semantic attributes of objects within, along with their uncertainty. Objects are assumed persistent in the scene, and their likelihood computed from intermittent visual data using a convolutional architecture, integrated within a Bayesian filtering framework with inertials and a context model. Our method yields a posterior estimate of geometry (attributed point cloud and associated uncertainty), semantics (identities and co-occurrence), and a point-estimate of topology for a variable number of objects within the scene, implemented causally and in real-time on commodity hardware.",0
"We consider the design of private prediction markets, financial markets designed to elicit predictions about uncertain events without revealing too much information about market participants' actions or beliefs. Our goal is to design market mechanisms in which participants' trades or wagers influence the market's behavior in a way that leads to accurate predictions, yet no single participant has too much influence over what others are able to observe. We study the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from differential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering mechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future event and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among bettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We provide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy truthfulness, budget balance in expectation, and other desirable properties while additionally guaranteeing epsilon-joint differential privacy in the bettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable level of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report. We then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction markets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which securities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an automated market maker. We show that under general conditions, it is impossible for such a market maker to simultaneously achieve bounded worst-case loss and epsilon-differential privacy without allowing the privacy guarantee to degrade extremely quickly as the number of trades grows, making such markets impractical in settings in which privacy is valued. We conclude by suggesting several avenues for potentially circumventing this lower bound.",0
"Selective classification techniques (also known as reject option) have not yet been considered in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs). These techniques can potentially significantly improve DNNs prediction performance by trading-off coverage. In this paper we propose a method to construct a selective classifier given a trained neural network. Our method allows a user to set a desired risk level. At test time, the classifier rejects instances as needed, to grant the desired risk (with high probability). Empirical results over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method, which opens up possibilities to operate DNNs in mission-critical applications. For example, using our method an unprecedented 2% error in top-5 ImageNet classification can be guaranteed with probability 99.9%, and almost 60% test coverage.",1
"Emerging ontology authoring methods to add knowledge to an ontology focus on ameliorating the validation bottleneck. The verification of the newly added axiom is still one of trying and seeing what the reasoner says, because a systematic testbed for ontology authoring is missing. We sought to address this by introducing the approach of test-driven development for ontology authoring. We specify 36 generic tests, as TBox queries and TBox axioms tested through individuals, and structure their inner workings in an `open box'-way, which cover the OWL 2 DL language features. This is implemented as a Protege plugin so that one can perform a TDD test as a black box test. We evaluated the two test approaches on their performance. The TBox queries were faster, and that effect is more pronounced the larger the ontology is. We provide a general sequence of a TDD process for ontology engineering as a foundation for a TDD methodology.",0
"Rapid growth of documents, web pages, and other types of text content is a huge challenge for the modern content management systems. One of the problems in the areas of information storage and retrieval is the lacking of semantic data. Ontologies can present knowledge in sharable and repeatedly usable manner and provide an effective way to reduce the data volume overhead by encoding the structure of a particular domain. Metadata in relational databases can be used to extract ontology from database in a special domain. According to solve the problem of sharing and reusing of data, approaches based on transforming relational database to ontology are proposed. In this paper we propose a method for automatic ontology construction based on relational database. Mining and obtaining further components from relational database leads to obtain knowledge with high semantic power and more expressiveness. Triggers are one of the database components which could be transformed to the ontology model and increase the amount of power and expressiveness of knowledge by presenting part of the knowledge dynamically",0
"The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) is an immune-inspired algorithm, developed for the purpose of anomaly detection. The algorithm performs multi-sensor data fusion and correlation which results in a 'context aware' detection system. Previous applications of the DCA have included the detection of potentially malicious port scanning activity, where it has produced high rates of true positives and low rates of false positives. In this work we aim to compare the performance of the DCA and of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) when applied to the detection of SYN port scans, through experimental analysis. A SOM is an ideal candidate for comparison as it shares similarities with the DCA in terms of the data fusion method employed. It is shown that the results of the two systems are comparable, and both produce false positives for the same processes. This shows that the DCA can produce anomaly detection results to the same standard as an established technique.",0
"This paper analyzes independence concepts for sets of probability measures associated with directed acyclic graphs. The paper shows that epistemic independence and the standard Markov condition violate desirable separation properties. The adoption of a contraction condition leads to d-separation but still fails to guarantee a belief separation property. To overcome this unsatisfactory situation, a strong Markov condition is proposed, based on epistemic independence. The main result is that the strong Markov condition leads to strong independence and does enforce separation properties; this result implies that (1) separation properties of Bayesian networks do extend to epistemic independence and sets of probability measures, and (2) strong independence has a clear justification based on epistemic independence and the strong Markov condition.",0
"In this paper we present a novel graph kernel framework inspired the by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism tests. Any WL test comprises a relabelling phase of the nodes based on test-specific information extracted from the graph, for example the set of neighbours of a node. We defined a novel relabelling and derived two kernels of the framework from it. The novel kernels are very fast to compute and achieve state-of-the-art results on five real-world datasets.",0
"Fundamental discrepancy between first order logic and statistical inference (global versus local properties of universe) is shown to be the obstacle for integration of logic and probability in L.p. logic of Bacchus. To overcome the counterintuitiveness of L.p. behaviour, a 3-valued logic is proposed.",0
"The ability to reason with natural language is a fundamental prerequisite for many NLP tasks such as information extraction, machine translation and question answering. To quantify this ability, systems are commonly tested whether they can recognize textual entailment, i.e., whether one sentence can be inferred from another one. However, in most NLP applications only single source sentences instead of sentence pairs are available. Hence, we propose a new task that measures how well a model can generate an entailed sentence from a source sentence. We take entailment-pairs of the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus and train an LSTM with attention. On a manually annotated test set we found that 82% of generated sentences are correct, an improvement of 10.3% over an LSTM baseline. A qualitative analysis shows that this model is not only capable of shortening input sentences, but also inferring new statements via paraphrasing and phrase entailment. We then apply this model recursively to input-output pairs, thereby generating natural language inference chains that can be used to automatically construct an entailment graph from source sentences. Finally, by swapping source and target sentences we can also train a model that given an input sentence invents additional information to generate a new sentence.",0
"Multiple Air Vehicles (AVs) to prosecute geographically dispersed targets is an important optimization problem. Associated multiple tasks viz., target classification, attack and verification are successively performed on each target. The optimal minimum time performance of these tasks requires cooperation among vehicles such that critical time constraints are satisfied i.e. target must be classified before it can be attacked and AV is sent to target area to verify its destruction after target has been attacked. Here, optimal task scheduling problem from Indian Air Force is formulated as Fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (FMILP) problem. The solution assigns all tasks to vehicles and performs scheduling in an optimal manner including scheduled staged departure times. Coupled tasks involving time and task order constraints are addressed. When AVs have sufficient endurance, existence of optimal solution is guaranteed. The solution developed can serve as an effective heuristic for different categories of AV optimization problems.",0
"An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of determining provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods--e.g. tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods--has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, inter-organizational, often internationally-spanning supply chains. Recent adoption of Internet of Things and Blockchain technologies give promise at better supply chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain as many favoured use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.",0
"In this paper we consider the nature of the machine intelligences we have created in the context of our human intelligence. We suggest that the fundamental difference between human and machine intelligence comes down to \emph{embodiment factors}. We define embodiment factors as the ratio between an entity's ability to communicate information vs compute information. We speculate on the role of embodiment factors in driving our own intelligence and consciousness. We briefly review dual process models of cognition and cast machine intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us subconsciously. Driven by concerns about the consequence of such a system we suggest prophylactic courses of action that could be considered. Our main conclusion is that it is \emph{not} sentient intelligence we should fear but \emph{non-sentient} intelligence.",0
"Planning problems where effects of actions are non-deterministic can be modeled as Markov decision processes. Planning problems are usually goal-directed. This paper proposes several techniques for exploiting the goal-directedness to accelerate value iteration, a standard algorithm for solving Markov decision processes. Empirical studies have shown that the techniques can bring about significant speedups.",0
"Dynamic behaviour of a WMN imposes stringent constraints on the routing policy of the network. In the shortest path based routing the shortest paths needs to be evaluated within a given time frame allowed by the WMN dynamics. The exact reasoning based shortest path evaluation methods usually fail to meet this rigid requirement. Thus, requiring some soft computing based approaches which can replace ""best for sure"" solutions with ""good enough"" solutions. This paper proposes a framework for optimal routing in the WMNs; where we investigate the suitability of Big Bang-Big Crunch (BB-BC), a soft computing based approach to evaluate shortest/near-shortest path. In order to make routing optimal we first propose to replace distance between the adjacent nodes with an integrated cost measure that takes into account throughput, delay, jitter and residual energy of a node. A fuzzy logic based inference mechanism evaluates this cost measure at each node. Using this distance measure we apply BB-BC optimization algorithm to evaluate shortest/near shortest path to update the routing tables periodically as dictated by network requirements. A large number of simulations were conducted and it has been observed that BB-BC algorithm appears to be a high potential candidate suitable for routing in WMNs.",0
"Classical higher-order logic, when utilized as a meta-logic in which various other (classical and non-classical) logics can be shallowly embedded, is well suited for realising a universal logic reasoning approach. Universal logic reasoning in turn, as envisioned already by Leibniz, may support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines. A respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of exemplary applications are discussed. In the future, universal logic reasoning in combination with appropriate, controlled forms of rational argumentation may serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines.",0
"Compiling graphical models has recently been under intense investigation, especially for probabilistic modeling and processing. We present here a novel data structure for compiling weighted graphical models (in particular, probabilistic models), called AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagram (AOMDD). This is a generalization of our previous work on constraint networks, to weighted models. The AOMDD is based on the frameworks of AND/OR search spaces for graphical models, and Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDD). The AOMDD is a canonical representation of a graphical model, and its size and compilation time are bounded exponentially by the treewidth of the graph, rather than pathwidth as is known for OBDDs. We discuss a Variable Elimination schedule for compilation, and present the general APPLY algorithm that combines two weighted AOMDDs, and also present a search based method for compilation method. The preliminary experimental evaluation is quite encouraging, showing the potential of the AOMDD data structure.",0
"Correction of Noisy Natural Language Text is an important and well studied problem in Natural Language Processing. It has a number of applications in domains like Statistical Machine Translation, Second Language Learning and Natural Language Generation. In this work, we consider some statistical techniques for Text Correction. We define the classes of errors commonly found in text and describe algorithms to correct them. The data has been taken from a poorly trained Machine Translation system. The algorithms use only a language model in the target language in order to correct the sentences. We use phrase based correction methods in both the algorithms. The phrases are replaced and combined to give us the final corrected sentence. We also present the methods to model different kinds of errors, in addition to results of the working of the algorithms on the test set. We show that one of the approaches fail to achieve the desired goal, whereas the other succeeds well. In the end, we analyze the possible reasons for such a trend in performance.",0
"This article is an overview of the ""SP theory of intelligence"". The theory aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. It is conceived as a brain-like system that receives 'New' information and stores some or all of it in compressed form as 'Old' information. It is realised in the form of a computer model - a first version of the SP machine. The concept of ""multiple alignment"" is a powerful central idea. Using heuristic techniques, the system builds multiple alignments that are 'good' in terms of information compression. For each multiple alignment, probabilities may be calculated. These provide the basis for calculating the probabilities of inferences. The system learns new structures from partial matches between patterns. Using heuristic techniques, the system searches for sets of structures that are 'good' in terms of information compression. These are normally ones that people judge to be 'natural', in accordance with the 'DONSVIC' principle -- the discovery of natural structures via information compression. The SP theory may be applied in several areas including 'computing', aspects of mathematics and logic, representation of knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of reasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving, information compression, neuroscience, and human perception and cognition. Examples include the parsing and production of language including discontinuous dependencies in syntax, pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction and its integration with part-whole relations, nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values, reasoning in Bayesian networks including 'explaining away', causal diagnosis, and the solving of a geometric analogy problem.",0
A landmark based heuristic is investigated for reducing query phase run-time of the probabilistic roadmap (\PRM) motion planning method. The heuristic is generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices within the \PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on \PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation.We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the ${\rm A}^*$ algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.,0
"This paper proposes FMAP (Forward Multi-Agent Planning), a fully-distributed multi-agent planning method that integrates planning and coordination. Although FMAP is specifically aimed at solving problems that require cooperation among agents, the flexibility of the domain-independent planning model allows FMAP to tackle multi-agent planning tasks of any type. In FMAP, agents jointly explore the plan space by building up refinement plans through a complete and flexible forward-chaining partial-order planner. The search is guided by $h_{DTG}$, a novel heuristic function that is based on the concepts of Domain Transition Graph and frontier state and is optimized to evaluate plans in distributed environments. Agents in FMAP apply an advanced privacy model that allows them to adequately keep private information while communicating only the data of the refinement plans that is relevant to each of the participating agents. Experimental results show that FMAP is a general-purpose approach that efficiently solves tightly-coupled domains that have specialized agents and cooperative goals as well as loosely-coupled problems. Specifically, the empirical evaluation shows that FMAP outperforms current MAP systems at solving complex planning tasks that are adapted from the International Planning Competition benchmarks.",0
"Reinforcement Learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral patterns for sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally, such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating it. FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm which maintains an explicit policy estimate by enabling temporal abstractions in the action space. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600 domain, Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mujoco domain and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients in the TORCS car racing domain.",1
"Use of intelligent decision aids can help alleviate the challenges of planning complex operations. We describe integrated algorithms, and a tool capable of translating a high-level concept for a tactical military operation into a fully detailed, actionable plan, producing automatically (or with human guidance) plans with realistic degree of detail and of human-like quality. Tight interleaving of several algorithms -- planning, adversary estimates, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption estimates -- comprise the computational approach of this tool. Although originally developed for Army large-unit operations, the technology is generic and also applies to a number of other domains, particularly in critical situations requiring detailed planning within a constrained period of time. In this paper, we focus particularly on the engineering tradeoffs in the design of the tool. In an experimental evaluation, reminiscent of the Turing test, the tool's performance compared favorably with human planners.",0
"The identification of performance-optimizing parameter settings is an important part of the development and application of algorithms. We describe an automatic framework for this algorithm configuration problem. More formally, we provide methods for optimizing a target algorithm's performance on a given class of problem instances by varying a set of ordinal and/or categorical parameters. We review a family of local-search-based algorithm configuration procedures and present novel techniques for accelerating them by adaptively limiting the time spent for evaluating individual configurations. We describe the results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our methods, based on the configuration of prominent complete and incomplete algorithms for SAT. We also present what is, to our knowledge, the first published work on automatically configuring the CPLEX mixed integer programming solver. All the algorithms we considered had default parameter settings that were manually identified with considerable effort. Nevertheless, using our automated algorithm configuration procedures, we achieved substantial and consistent performance improvements.",0
"Answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over $\mathcal{EL}$ knowledge bases (KBs) with complex role inclusions is PSPACE-hard and in PSPACE in certain cases; however, if complex role inclusions are restricted to role transitivity, the upper complexity bound has so far been unknown. Furthermore, the existing algorithms cannot handle reflexive roles, and they are not practicable. Finally, the problem is tractable for acyclic CQs and $\mathcal{ELH}$, and NP-complete for unrestricted CQs and $\mathcal{ELHO}$ KBs. In this paper we complete the complexity landscape of CQ answering for several important cases. In particular, we present a practicable NP algorithm for answering CQs over $\mathcal{ELHO}^s$ KBs---a logic containing all of OWL 2 EL, but with complex role inclusions restricted to role transitivity. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that the algorithm can be suitable for practical use. Moreover, we show that, even for a restricted class of so-called arborescent acyclic queries, CQ answering over $\mathcal{EL}$ KBs becomes NP-hard in the presence of either transitive or reflexive roles. Finally, we show that answering arborescent CQs over $\mathcal{ELHO}$ KBs is tractable, whereas answering acyclic CQs is NP-hard.",1
"In this paper, first we present a new explanation for the relation between logical circuits and artificial neural networks, logical circuits and fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems. Then, based on these results, we propose a new neuro-fuzzy computing system which can effectively be implemented on the memristor-crossbar structure. One important feature of the proposed system is that its hardware can directly be trained using the Hebbian learning rule and without the need to any optimization. The system also has a very good capability to deal with huge number of input-out training data without facing problems like overtraining.",0
"One way to approach end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a policy function that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from a front-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or a reference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy function is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and ground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known to suffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states reachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advanced algorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by iteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained policies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to a reference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often expensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called SafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous driving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show that it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe a significant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to the effect of automated curriculum learning.",0
"We study the model of projective simulation (PS) which is a novel approach to artificial intelligence (AI). Recently it was shown that the PS agent performs well in a number of simple task environments, also when compared to standard models of reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper we study the performance of the PS agent further in more complicated scenarios. To that end we chose two well-studied benchmarking problems, namely the ""grid-world"" and the ""mountain-car"" problem, which challenge the model with large and continuous input space. We compare the performance of the PS agent model with those of existing models and show that the PS agent exhibits competitive performance also in such scenarios.",0
"Trilateration-based localization (TBL) has become a corner stone of modern technology. This study formulates the concern on how wireless sensor networks can take advantage of the computational intelligent techniques using both single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an overall aim of concurrently minimizing the required time for localization, minimizing energy consumed during localization, and maximizing the number of nodes fully localized through the adjustment of wireless sensor transmission ranges while using TBL process. A parameter-study of the applied PSO variants is performed, leading to results that show algorithmic improvements of up to 32% in the evaluated objectives.",0

"Square grids are commonly used in robotics and game development to model an agent's environment, and well known in Artificial Intelligence heuristic search algorithms (A*, JPS, Theta* etc.) are utilized for grid path planning. A lot of research in this area has been focused so far on finding the shortest paths while in many applications producing smooth paths is preferable. In our work, we study the problem of generating smooth grid paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We put angle constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm of solving it - LIAN. We examine LIAN both theoretically and empirically. On the theoretical side, we prove that LIAN is sound and complete (under well-defined restrictions). On the experimental side, we show that LIAN significantly outperforms competitors in ability to find solutions under tough resource constraints and in computational efficiency.",0
"This article deals with Part family formation problem which is believed to be moderately complicated to be solved in polynomial time in the vicinity of Group Technology (GT). In the past literature researchers investigated that the part family formation techniques are principally based on production flow analysis (PFA) which usually considers operational requirements, sequences and time. Part Coding Analysis (PCA) is merely considered in GT which is believed to be the proficient method to identify the part families. PCA classifies parts by allotting them to different families based on their resemblances in: (1) design characteristics such as shape and size, and/or (2) manufacturing characteristics (machining requirements). A novel approach based on simulated annealing namely SAPFOCS is adopted in this study to develop effective part families exploiting the PCA technique. Thereafter Taguchi's orthogonal design method is employed to solve the critical issues on the subject of parameters selection for the proposed metaheuristic algorithm. The adopted technique is therefore tested on 5 different datasets of size 5 \times 9 to 27 \times 9 and the obtained results are compared with C-Linkage clustering technique. The experimental results reported that the proposed metaheuristic algorithm is extremely effective in terms of the quality of the solution obtained and has outperformed C-Linkage algorithm in most instances.",0
"Soft goals extend the classical model of planning with a simple model of preferences. The best plans are then not the ones with least cost but the ones with maximum utility, where the utility of a plan is the sum of the utilities of the soft goals achieved minus the plan cost. Finding plans with high utility appears to involve two linked problems: choosing a subset of soft goals to achieve and finding a low-cost plan to achieve them. New search algorithms and heuristics have been developed for planning with soft goals, and a new track has been introduced in the International Planning Competition (IPC) to test their performance. In this note, we show however that these extensions are not needed: soft goals do not increase the expressive power of the basic model of planning with action costs, as they can easily be compiled away. We apply this compilation to the problems of the net-benefit track of the most recent IPC, and show that optimal and satisficing cost-based planners do better on the compiled problems than optimal and satisficing net-benefit planners on the original problems with explicit soft goals. Furthermore, we show that penalties, or negative preferences expressing conditions to avoid, can also be compiled away using a similar idea.",0
"In clinical data sets we often find static information (e.g. gender of the patients, blood type, etc.) combined with sequences of data that are recorded during multiple hospital visits (e.g. medications prescribed, tests performed, etc.). Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have proven to be very successful for modelling sequences of data in many areas of Machine Learning. In this work we present an approach based on RNNs that is specifically designed for the clinical domain and that combines static and dynamic information in order to predict future events. We work with a database collected in the Charit\'{e} Hospital in Berlin that contains all the information concerning patients that underwent a kidney transplantation. After the transplantation three main endpoints can occur: rejection of the kidney, loss of the kidney and death of the patient. Our goal is to predict, given the Electronic Health Record of each patient, whether any of those endpoints will occur within the next six or twelve months after each visit to the clinic. We compared different types of RNNs that we developed for this work, a model based on a Feedforward Neural Network and a Logistic Regression model. We found that the RNN that we developed based on Gated Recurrent Units provides the best performance for this task. We also performed an additional experiment using these models to predict next actions and found that for such use case the model based on a Feedforward Neural Network outperformed the other models. Our hypothesis is that long-term dependencies are not as relevant in this task.",0
"In video games, virtual characters' decision systems often use a simplified representation of the world. To increase both their autonomy and believability we want those characters to be able to learn this representation from human players. We propose to use a model called growing neural gas to learn by imitation the topology of the environment. The implementation of the model, the modifications and the parameters we used are detailed. Then, the quality of the learned representations and their evolution during the learning are studied using different measures. Improvements for the growing neural gas to give more information to the character's model are given in the conclusion.",0
"Estimation of causal effects of interventions in dynamical systems of interacting agents is under-developed. In this paper, we explore the intricacies of this problem through standard approaches, and demonstrate the need for more appropriate methods. Working under the Neyman-Rubin causal model, we proceed to develop a causal inference method and we explicate the stability assumptions that are necessary for valid causal inference. Our method consists of a behavioral component that models the evolution of agent behaviors over time and informs on the long-term distribution of agent behaviors in the system, and a game-theoretic component that models the observed distribution of agent actions conditional on adopted behaviors. This allows the imputation of long-term estimates of quantities of interest, and thus the estimation of long-term causal effects of interventions. We demonstrate our method on a dataset from behavioral game theory, and discuss open problems to stimulate future research.",1
"Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells that provide a vital link between the innate and adaptive immune system, providing the initial detection of pathogenic invaders. Research into this family of cells has revealed that they perform information fusion which directs immune responses. We have derived a Dendritic Cell Algorithm based on the functionality of these cells, by modelling the biological signals and differentiation pathways to build a control mechanism for an artificial immune system. We present algorithmic details in addition to experimental results, when the algorithm was applied to anomaly detection for the detection of port scans. The results show the Dendritic Cell Algorithm is sucessful at detecting port scans.",0
"Many optimization tasks have to be handled in noisy environments, where we cannot obtain the exact evaluation of a solution but only a noisy one. For noisy optimization tasks, evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a kind of stochastic metaheuristic search algorithm, have been widely and successfully applied. Previous work mainly focuses on empirical studying and designing EAs for noisy optimization, while, the theoretical counterpart has been little investigated. In this paper, we investigate a largely ignored question, i.e., whether an optimization problem will always become harder for EAs in a noisy environment. We prove that the answer is negative, with respect to the measurement of the expected running time. The result implies that, for optimization tasks that have already been quite hard to solve, the noise may not have a negative effect, and the easier a task the more negatively affected by the noise. On a representative problem where the noise has a strong negative effect, we examine two commonly employed mechanisms in EAs dealing with noise, the re-evaluation and the threshold selection strategies. The analysis discloses that the two strategies, however, both are not effective, i.e., they do not make the EA more noise tolerant. We then find that a small modification of the threshold selection allows it to be proven as an effective strategy for dealing with the noise in the problem.",0
"An initial study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms used to design vertical-axis wind turbines wherein candidate prototypes are evaluated under approximated wind tunnel conditions after being physically instantiated by a three-dimensional printer has recently been presented. Unlike other approaches, such as computational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations were used and no model assumptions were made. This paper extends that work by exploring alternative surrogate modelling and evolutionary techniques. The accuracy of various modelling algorithms used to estimate the fitness of evaluated individuals from the initial experiments is compared. The effect of temporally windowing surrogate model training samples is explored. A surrogate-assisted approach based on an enhanced local search is introduced; and alternative coevolution collaboration schemes are examined.",0
"Here, we propose a brain-inspired winner-take-all emotional neural network (WTAENN) and prove the universal approximation property for the novel architecture. WTAENN is a single layered feedforward neural network that benefits from the excitatory, inhibitory, and expandatory neural connections as well as the winner-take-all (WTA) competitions in the human brain s nervous system. The WTA competition increases the information capacity of the model without adding hidden neurons. The universal approximation capability of the proposed architecture is illustrated on two example functions, trained by a genetic algorithm, and then applied to several competing recent and benchmark problems such as in curve fitting, pattern recognition, classification and prediction. In particular, it is tested on twelve UCI classification datasets, a facial recognition problem, three real world prediction problems (2 chaotic time series of geomagnetic activity indices and wind farm power generation data), two synthetic case studies with constant and nonconstant noise variance as well as k-selector and linear programming problems. Results indicate the general applicability and often superiority of the approach in terms of higher accuracy and lower model complexity, especially where low computational complexity is imperative.",0
"Structured sparse optimization is an important and challenging problem for analyzing high-dimensional data in a variety of applications such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, social networks, and astronomy. Although a number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups, clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, Graph-IHT and Graph-GHTP, to optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Several efforts to predict student failure rate (SFR) at school accurately still remains a core problem area faced by many in the educational sector. The procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation. Also, the high number of factors, incomplete and unbalanced dataset, and black boxing issues as in Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic systems exposes the need for more efficient tools. Currently the application of Genetic Programming (GP) holds great promises and has produced tremendous positive results in different sectors. In this regard, this study developed GPSFARPS, a software application to provide a robust solution to the prediction of SFR using an evolutionary algorithm known as multi-gene genetic programming. The approach is validated by feeding a testing data set to the evolved GP models. Result obtained from GPSFARPS simulations show its unique ability to evolve a suitable failure rate expression with a fast convergence at 30 generations from a maximum specified generation of 500. The multi-gene system was also able to minimize the evolved model expression and accurately predict student failure rate using a subset of the original expression",0
"One of the key challenges of artificial intelligence is to learn models that are effective in the context of planning. In this document we introduce the predictron architecture. The predictron consists of a fully abstract model, represented by a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple ""imagined"" planning steps. Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and values over multiple planning depths. The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function. We applied the predictron to procedurally generated random mazes and a simulator for the game of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural network architectures.",1
"In the policy making process a number of disparate and diverse issues such as economic development, environmental aspects, as well as the social acceptance of the policy, need to be considered. A single person might not have all the required expertises, and decision support systems featuring optimization components can help to assess policies. Leveraging on previous work on Strategic Environmental Assessment, we developed a fully-fledged system that is able to provide optimal plans with respect to a given objective, to perform multi-objective optimization and provide sets of Pareto optimal plans, and to visually compare them. Each plan is environmentally assessed and its footprint is evaluated. The heart of the system is an application developed in a popular Constraint Logic Programming system on the Reals sort. It has been equipped with a web service module that can be queried through standard interfaces, and an intuitive graphic user interface.",0
"A previously developed quantum search algorithm for solving 1-SAT problems in a single step is generalized to apply to a range of highly constrained k-SAT problems. We identify a bound on the number of clauses in satisfiability problems for which the generalized algorithm can find a solution in a constant number of steps as the number of variables increases. This performance contrasts with the linear growth in the number of steps required by the best classical algorithms, and the exponential number required by classical and quantum methods that ignore the problem structure. In some cases, the algorithm can also guarantee that insoluble problems in fact have no solutions, unlike previously proposed quantum search algorithms.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a popular framework for modeling combinatorial problems. However, ASP cannot easily be used for reasoning about uncertain information. Possibilistic ASP (PASP) is an extension of ASP that combines possibilistic logic and ASP. In PASP a weight is associated with each rule, where this weight is interpreted as the certainty with which the conclusion can be established when the body is known to hold. As such, it allows us to model and reason about uncertain information in an intuitive way. In this paper we present new semantics for PASP, in which rules are interpreted as constraints on possibility distributions. Special models of these constraints are then identified as possibilistic answer sets. In addition, since ASP is a special case of PASP in which all the rules are entirely certain, we obtain a new characterization of ASP in terms of constraints on possibility distributions. This allows us to uncover a new form of disjunction, called weak disjunction, that has not been previously considered in the literature. In addition to introducing and motivating the semantics of weak disjunction, we also pinpoint its computational complexity. In particular, while the complexity of most reasoning tasks coincides with standard disjunctive ASP, we find that brave reasoning for programs with weak disjunctions is easier.",0
"Review fraud is a pervasive problem in online commerce, in which fraudulent sellers write or purchase fake reviews to manipulate perception of their products and services. Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs, including 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given dataset. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent reviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing successful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine these 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD) model, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Based on our model we formulate a likelihood-based suspiciousness metric, Normalized Expected Surprise Total (NEST). We propose a linear-time algorithm for performing Bayesian inference using our model and computing the metric. Experiments on real data show that BIRDNEST successfully spots review fraud in large, real-world graphs: the 50 most suspicious users of the Flipkart platform flagged by our algorithm were investigated and all identified as fraudulent by domain experts at Flipkart.",0
"The development of machine learning in particular and artificial intelligent in general has been strongly conditioned by the lack of an appropriate interface layer between deduction, abduction and induction. In this work we extend traditional algebraic specification methods in this direction. Here we assume that such interface for AI emerges from an adequate Neural-Symbolic integration. This integration is made for universe of discourse described on a Topos governed by a many-valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic. Sentences are integrated in a symbolic knowledge base describing the problem domain, codified using a graphic-based language, wherein every logic connective is defined by a neuron in an artificial network. This allows the integration of first-order formulas into a network architecture as background knowledge, and simplifies symbolic rule extraction from trained networks. For the train of such neural networks we changed the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, restricting the knowledge dissemination in the network structure using soft crystallization. This procedure reduces neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning performance, allowing the emergence of symbolic patterns. This makes the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive power of {\L}ukasiewicz logic language, reducing the information lost on translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We tested this method on the extraction of knowledge from specified structures. For it, we present the notion of fuzzy state automata, and we use automata behaviour to infer its structure. We use this type of automata on the generation of models for relations specified as symbolic background knowledge.",0
"We propose a method for an agent to revise its incomplete probabilistic beliefs when a new piece of propositional information is observed. In this work, an agent's beliefs are represented by a set of probabilistic formulae -- a belief base. The method involves determining a representative set of 'boundary' probability distributions consistent with the current belief base, revising each of these probability distributions and then translating the revised information into a new belief base. We use a version of Lewis Imaging as the revision operation. The correctness of the approach is proved. The expressivity of the belief bases under consideration are rather restricted, but has some applications. We also discuss methods of belief base revision employing the notion of optimum entropy, and point out some of the benefits and difficulties in those methods. Both the boundary distribution method and the optimum entropy method are reasonable, yet yield different results.",0
"Continuous-time Bayesian networks is a natural structured representation language for multicomponent stochastic processes that evolve continuously over time. Despite the compact representation, inference in such models is intractable even in relatively simple structured networks. Here we introduce a mean field variational approximation in which we use a product of inhomogeneous Markov processes to approximate a distribution over trajectories. This variational approach leads to a globally consistent distribution, which can be efficiently queried. Additionally, it provides a lower bound on the probability of observations, thus making it attractive for learning tasks. We provide the theoretical foundations for the approximation, an efficient implementation that exploits the wide range of highly optimized ordinary differential equations (ODE) solvers, experimentally explore characterizations of processes for which this approximation is suitable, and show applications to a large-scale realworld inference problem.",0
"The problem of deciding whether CSP instances admit solutions has been deeply studied in the literature, and several structural tractability results have been derived so far. However, constraint satisfaction comes in practice as a computation problem where the focus is either on finding one solution, or on enumerating all solutions, possibly projected over some given set of output variables. The paper investigates the structural tractability of the problem of enumerating (possibly projected) solutions, where tractability means here computable with polynomial delay (WPD), since in general exponentially many solutions may be computed. A general framework based on the notion of tree projection of hypergraphs is considered, which generalizes all known decomposition methods. Tractability results have been obtained both for classes of structures where output variables are part of their specification, and for classes of structures where computability WPD must be ensured for any possible set of output variables. These results are shown to be tight, by exhibiting dichotomies for classes of structures having bounded arity and where the tree decomposition method is considered.",0
"In covering based rough sets, the neighborhood of an element is the intersection of all the covering blocks containing the element. All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. In the course of studying under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, with the help of which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.",0
"Model counting is the problem of computing the number of models that satisfy a given propositional theory. It has recently been applied to solving inference tasks in probabilistic logic programming, where the goal is to compute the probability of given queries being true provided a set of mutually independent random variables, a model (a logic program) and some evidence. The core of solving this inference task involves translating the logic program to a propositional theory and using a model counter. In this paper, we show that for some problems that involve inductive definitions like reachability in a graph, the translation of logic programs to SAT can be expensive for the purpose of solving inference tasks. For such problems, direct implementation of stable model semantics allows for more efficient solving. We present two implementation techniques, based on unfounded set detection, that extend a propositional model counter to a stable model counter. Our experiments show that for particular problems, our approach can outperform a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming solver by several orders of magnitude in terms of running time and space requirements, and can solve instances of significantly larger sizes on which the current solver runs out of time or memory.",1
"Radiomics has proven to be a powerful prognostic tool for cancer detection, and has previously been applied in lung, breast, prostate, and head-and-neck cancer studies with great success. However, these radiomics-driven methods rely on pre-defined, hand-crafted radiomic feature sets that can limit their ability to characterize unique cancer traits. In this study, we introduce a novel discovery radiomics framework where we directly discover custom radiomic features from the wealth of available medical imaging data. In particular, we leverage novel StochasticNet radiomic sequencers for extracting custom radiomic features tailored for characterizing unique cancer tissue phenotype. Using StochasticNet radiomic sequencers discovered using a wealth of lung CT data, we perform binary classification on 42,340 lung lesions obtained from the CT scans of 93 patients in the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Preliminary results show significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, indicating the potential of the proposed discovery radiomics framework for improving cancer screening and diagnosis.",0
"Logic programs under the stable model semantics, or answer-set programs, provide an expressive rule-based knowledge representation framework, featuring a formal, declarative and well-understood semantics. However, handling the evolution of rule bases is still a largely open problem. The AGM framework for belief change was shown to give inappropriate results when directly applied to logic programs under a non-monotonic semantics such as the stable models. The approaches to address this issue, developed so far, proposed update semantics based on manipulating the syntactic structure of programs and rules.",0
"There is a significant lack of unified approaches to building generally intelligent machines. The majority of current artificial intelligence research operates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without considering the importance of the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and unify principles that guide the basis of our development of general artificial intelligence. These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a tool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as the ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help steer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying, measuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level intelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both implementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable way to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary conditions in the search for general artificial intelligence. We believe that such a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together definitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to collaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this century.",0
"We construe smart meeting cinematography with a focus on professional situations such as meetings and seminars, possibly conducted in a distributed manner across socio-spatially separated groups. The basic objective in smart meeting cinematography is to interpret professional interactions involving people, and automatically produce dynamic recordings of discussions, debates, presentations etc in the presence of multiple communication modalities. Typical modalities include gestures (e.g., raising one's hand for a question, applause), voice and interruption, electronic apparatus (e.g., pressing a button), movement (e.g., standing-up, moving around) etc. ROTUNDE, an instance of smart meeting cinematography concept, aims to: (a) develop functionality-driven benchmarks with respect to the interpretation and control capabilities of human-cinematographers, real-time video editors, surveillance personnel, and typical human performance in everyday situations; (b) Develop general tools for the commonsense cognitive interpretation of dynamic scenes from the viewpoint of visuo-spatial cognition centred perceptual narrativisation. Particular emphasis is placed on declarative representations and interfacing mechanisms that seamlessly integrate within large-scale cognitive (interaction) systems and companion technologies consisting of diverse AI sub-components. For instance, the envisaged tools would provide general capabilities for high-level commonsense reasoning about space, events, actions, change, and interaction.",0
"We study the problem of learning to reason in large scale knowledge graphs (KGs). More specifically, we describe a novel reinforcement learning framework for learning multi-hop relational paths: we use a policy-based agent with continuous states based on knowledge graph embeddings, which reasons in a KG vector space by sampling the most promising relation to extend its path. In contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method outperforms a path-ranking based algorithm and knowledge graph embedding methods on Freebase and Never-Ending Language Learning datasets.",1
"Reinforcement learning has been applied to many interesting problems such as the famous TD-gammon and the inverted helicopter flight. However, little effort has been put into developing methods to learn policies for complex persistent tasks and tasks that are time-sensitive. In this paper, we take a step towards solving this problem by using signal temporal logic (STL) as task specification, and taking advantage of the temporal abstraction feature that the options framework provide. We show via simulation that a relatively easy to implement algorithm that combines STL and options can learn a satisfactory policy with a small number of training cases",0
"The undirected technique for evaluating belief networks [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988] requires clustering the nodes in the network into a junction tree. In the traditional view, the junction tree is constructed from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated belief network: triangulation is taken to be the primitive concept, the goal towards which any clustering algorithm (e.g. node elimination) is directed. In this paper, we present an alternative conception of clustering, in which clusters and the junction tree property play the role of primitives: given a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a modified version of) the junction tree property, we transform this graph until we have obtained a tree. There are several advantages to this approach: it is much clearer and easier to understand, which is important for humans who are constructing belief networks; it admits a wider range of heuristics which may enable more efficient or superior clustering algorithms; and it serves as the natural basis for an incremental clustering scheme, which we describe.",0
"Ontology-based data access is concerned with querying incomplete data sources in the presence of domain-specific knowledge provided by an ontology. A central notion in this setting is that of an ontology-mediated query, which is a database query coupled with an ontology. In this paper, we study several classes of ontology-mediated queries, where the database queries are given as some form of conjunctive query and the ontologies are formulated in description logics or other relevant fragments of first-order logic, such as the guarded fragment and the unary-negation fragment. The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we characterize the expressive power of ontology-mediated queries in terms of fragments of disjunctive datalog. Second, we establish intimate connections between ontology-mediated queries and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their logical generalization, MMSNP formulas. Third, we exploit these connections to obtain new results regarding (i) first-order rewritability and datalog-rewritability of ontology-mediated queries, (ii) P/NP dichotomies for ontology-mediated queries, and (iii) the query containment problem for ontology-mediated queries.",0
"While natural languages are compositional, how state-of-the-art neural models achieve compositionality is still unclear. We propose a deep network, which not only achieves competitive accuracy for text classification, but also exhibits compositional behavior. That is, while creating hierarchical representations of a piece of text, such as a sentence, the lower layers of the network distribute their layer-specific attention weights to individual words. In contrast, the higher layers compose meaningful phrases and clauses, whose lengths increase as the networks get deeper until fully composing the sentence.",1
"The study of opinions, their formation and change, is one of the defining topics addressed by social psychology, but in recent years other disciplines, as computer science and complexity, have addressed this challenge. Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields, several key questions still remain unanswered. The aim of this paper is to challenge the current theories on opinion by putting forward a cognitively grounded model where opinions are described as specific mental representations whose main properties are put forward. A comparison with reputation will be also presented.",0
"Algorithms for exact and approximate inference in stochastic logic programs (SLPs) are presented, based respectively, on variable elimination and importance sampling. We then show how SLPs can be used to represent prior distributions for machine learning, using (i) logic programs and (ii) Bayes net structures as examples. Drawing on existing work in statistics, we apply the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to construct a Markov chain which samples from the posterior distribution. A Prolog implementation for this is described. We also discuss the possibility of constructing explicit representations of the posterior.",0
"Complete tree search is a highly effective method for tackling MIP problems, and over the years, a plethora of branching heuristics have been introduced to further refine the technique for varying problems. Recently, portfolio algorithms have taken the process a step further, trying to predict the best heuristic for each instance at hand. However, the motivation behind algorithm selection can be taken further still, and used to dynamically choose the most appropriate algorithm for each encountered subproblem. In this paper we identify a feature space that captures both the evolution of the problem in the branching tree and the similarity among subproblems of instances from the same MIP models. We show how to exploit these features to decide the best time to switch the branching heuristic and then show how such a system can be trained efficiently. Experiments on a highly heterogeneous collection of MIP instances show significant gains over the pure algorithm selection approach that for a given instance uses only a single heuristic throughout the search.",0
"This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning fields. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and artificial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal traffic distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.",0
"We study decision making in environments where the reward is only partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of an action and an observed context. This setting, known as contextual bandits, encompasses a wide variety of applications including health-care policy and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous approaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance. We leverage the strength and overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches by adapting doubly robust estimation techniques to the problems of policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this approach yields unbiased (and often lower variance) value estimates when we have either a good model of rewards or a good model of past policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrate that the doubly robust technique uniformly improves existing techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the doubly robust approach to become common practice.",1

"In this work, we explore a genre of puzzles (""image riddles"") which involves a set of images and a question. Answering these puzzles require both capabilities involving visual detection (including object, activity recognition) and, knowledge-based or commonsense reasoning. We compile a dataset of over 3k riddles where each riddle consists of 4 images and a groundtruth answer. The annotations are validated using crowd-sourced evaluation. We also define an automatic evaluation metric to track future progress. Our task bears similarity with the commonly known IQ tasks such as analogy solving, sequence filling that are often used to test intelligence.",0
"Binary Knapsack Problem (BKP) is to select a subset of an element (item) set with the highest value while keeping the total weight within the capacity of the knapsack. This paper presents an integer programming model for a variation of BKP where the value of each element may depend on selecting or ignoring other elements. Strengths of such Value-Related Dependencies are assumed to be imprecise and hard to specify. To capture this imprecision, we have proposed modeling value-related dependencies using fuzzy graphs and their algebraic structure.",0
"Regularization is a well studied problem in the context of neural networks. It is usually used to improve the generalization performance when the number of input samples is relatively small or heavily contaminated with noise. The regularization of a parametric model can be achieved in different manners some of which are early stopping (Morgan and Bourlard, 1990), weight decay, output smoothing that are used to avoid overfitting during the training of the considered model. From a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing certain prior distributions on model parameters (Krogh and Hertz, 1991). Using Bishop's approximation (Bishop, 1995) of the objective function when a restricted type of noise is added to the input of a parametric function, we derive the higher order terms of the Taylor expansion and analyze the coefficients of the regularization terms induced by the noisy input. In particular we study the effect of penalizing the Hessian of the mapping function with respect to the input in terms of generalization performance. We also show how we can control independently this coefficient by explicitly penalizing the Jacobian of the mapping function on corrupted inputs.",0
We propose an approach to generate geometric theorems from electronic images of diagrams automatically. The approach makes use of techniques of Hough transform to recognize geometric objects and their labels and of numeric verification to mine basic geometric relations. Candidate propositions are generated from the retrieved information by using six strategies and geometric theorems are obtained from the candidates via algebraic computation. Experiments with a preliminary implementation illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach for generating nontrivial theorems from images of diagrams. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automated discovery of profound geometric knowledge from simple image data and has potential applications in geometric knowledge management and education.,0

Springer, 2010.], we introduce explicit (CCE), hidden (HCCE), and asymmetric (ACCE) variants of a procedure that eliminates covered clauses from CNF formulas. We show that these procedures are more effective in reducing CNF formulas than the respective variants of blocked clause elimination, and may hence be interesting as new preprocessing/simplification techniques for SAT solving.",0
"Over 13 months in 2016-17 the FCC conducted an ""incentive auction"" to repurpose radio spectrum from broadcast television to wireless internet. In the end, the auction yielded $19.8 billion, $10.05 billion of which was paid to 175 broadcasters for voluntarily relinquishing their licenses across 14 UHF channels. Stations that continued broadcasting were assigned potentially new channels to fit as densely as possible into the channels that remained. The government netted more than $7 billion (used to pay down the national debt) after covering costs. A crucial element of the auction design was the construction of a solver, dubbed SATFC, that determined whether sets of stations could be ""repacked"" in this way; it needed to run every time a station was given a price quote. This paper describes the process by which we built SATFC. We adopted an approach we dub ""deep optimization"", taking a data-driven, highly parametric, and computationally intensive approach to solver design. More specifically, to build SATFC we designed software that could pair both complete and local-search SAT-encoded feasibility checking with a wide range of domain-specific techniques. We then used automatic algorithm configuration techniques to construct a portfolio of eight complementary algorithms to be run in parallel, aiming to achieve good performance on instances that arose in proprietary auction simulations. To evaluate the impact of our solver in this paper, we built an open-source reverse auction simulator. We found that within the short time budget required in practice, SATFC solved more than 95% of the problems it encountered. Furthermore, the incentive auction paired with SATFC produced nearly optimal allocations in a restricted setting and substantially outperformed other alternatives at national scale.",0
We report recent research on computing with biology-based neural network models by means of physics-based opto-electronic hardware. New technology provides opportunities for very-high-speed computation and uncovers problems obstructing the wide-spread use of this new capability. The Computation Modeling community may be able to offer solutions to these cross-boundary research problems.,0
"The systematic modelling of \emph{dynamic spatial systems} [9] is a key requirement in a wide range of application areas such as comonsense cognitive robotics, computer-aided architecture design, dynamic geographic information systems. We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning ---a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems-- based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT). ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms using choice formulas. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other prominent contemporary spatial reasoning systems. Our results show that ASPMT(QS) is the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e. addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.",0
"Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) methods for anomaly detection are introduced via a security-related application. Operational requirements for online learning stability are outlined and compared to mathematical definitions as applied to the learning process of a representative SRL method - Bayesian Logic Programs (BLP). Since a formal proof of online stability appears to be impossible, tentative common sense requirements are formulated and tested by theoretical and experimental analysis of a simple and analytically tractable BLP model. It is found that learning algorithms in initial stages of online learning can lock on unstable false predictors that nevertheless comply with our tentative stability requirements and thus masquerade as bona fide solutions. The very expressiveness of SRL seems to cause significant stability issues in settings with many variables and scarce data. We conclude that reliable anomaly detection with SRL-methods requires monitoring by an overarching framework that may involve a comprehensive context knowledge base or human supervision.",0
This paper introduces a new algorithm for the induction if complex finite state automata from samples of behavior. The algorithm is based on information theoretic principles. The algorithm reduces the search space by many orders of magnitude over what was previously thought possible. We compare the algorithm with some existing induction techniques for finite state automata and show that the algorithm is much superior in both run time and quality of inductions.,0
"Consider a multi-agent system in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Each agent's local decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) and agents must coordinate on a joint action in each period, which provides a reward to each agent and causes local state transitions. A social planner knows the model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy, but agents are self-interested and have private local state. We provide an incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves the optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the induced stochastic game. In the special case in which local problems are Markov chains and agents compete to take a single action in each period, we leverage Gittins allocation indices to provide an efficient factored algorithm and distribute computation of the optimal policy among the agents. Distributed, optimal coordinated learning in a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problem is obtained as a special case.",0
"Sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives arise naturally in practice and pose unique challenges for research in decision-theoretic planning and learning, which has largely focused on single-objective settings. This article surveys algorithms designed for sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives. Though there is a growing body of literature on this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identify three distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to a single-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to the applicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projects multi-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. We show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which can be a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, we survey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning. Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future work.",0
"The information retrieval systems that are present nowadays are mainly based on full text matching of keywords or topic based classification. This matching of keywords often returns a large number of irrelevant information and this does not meet the users query requirement. In order to solve this problem and to enhance the search using semantic environment, a technique named ontology is implemented for the field of poultry in this paper. Ontology is an emerging technique in the current field of research in semantic environment. This paper constructs ontology using the tool named Protege version 4.0 and this also generates Resource Description Framework schema and XML scripts for using poultry ontology in web.",0
"Using current reinforcement learning methods, it has recently become possible to learn to play unknown 3D games from raw pixels. In this work, we study the challenges that arise in such complex environments, and summarize current methods to approach these. We choose a task within the Doom game, that has not been approached yet. The goal for the agent is to fight enemies in a 3D world consisting of five rooms. We train the DQN and LSTM-A3C algorithms on this task. Results show that both algorithms learn sensible policies, but fail to achieve high scores given the amount of training. We provide insights into the learned behavior, which can serve as a valuable starting point for further research in the Doom domain.",0
"In this paper we present some results obtained with a troupe of low-cost robots designed to cooperatively explore and adquire the map of unknown structured orthogonal environments. In order to improve the covering of the explored zone, the robots show different behaviours and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet. The returning robots deliver to a host computer their partial maps and the host incrementally generates the map of the environment by means of apossibility/ necessity grid.",0
"In [1], we introduced mechanical learning and proposed 2 approaches to mechanical learning. Here, we follow one such approach to well describe the objects and the processes of learning. We discuss 2 kinds of patterns: objective and subjective pattern. Subjective pattern is crucial for learning machine. We prove that for any objective pattern we can find a proper subjective pattern based upon least base patterns to express the objective pattern well. X-form is algebraic expression for subjective pattern. Collection of X-forms form internal representation space, which is center of learning machine. We discuss learning by teaching and without teaching. We define data sufficiency by X-form. We then discussed some learning strategies. We show, in each strategy, with sufficient data, and with certain capabilities, learning machine indeed can learn any pattern (universal learning machine). In appendix, with knowledge of learning machine, we try to view deep learning from a different angle, i.e. its internal representation space and its learning dynamics.",0
"Open Trip Planner was identified as the most promising open source multi-modal trip planning software. Open Street Map, which provides mapping data to Open Trip Planner, is one of the most well-known open source international repository of geographic data. General Transit Feed Specification, which provides transportation data to Open Trip Planner, has been the standard for describing transit systems and platform for numerous applications. Together, when used to implement an instance of Open Trip Planner, these software has been helping in traffic decongestion all over the world by assisting commuters to shift from using private transportation modes to public ones. Their potential however goes beyond providing multi-modal public transportation routes. This paper aims to first discuss the researchers' experience in implementing a public transportation route planner for the purpose of traffic decongestion.The researchers would examine the prospective of using the system for disaster preparedness and recovery and concrete ways on how to realize them.",0
"Diversification-Based Learning (DBL) derives from a collection of principles and methods introduced in the field of metaheuristics that have broad applications in computing and optimization. We show that the DBL framework goes significantly beyond that of the more recent Opposition-based learning (OBL) framework introduced in Tizhoosh (2005), which has become the focus of numerous research initiatives in machine learning and metaheuristic optimization. We unify and extend earlier proposals in metaheuristic search (Glover, 1997, Glover and Laguna, 1997) to give a collection of approaches that are more flexible and comprehensive than OBL for creating intensification and diversification strategies in metaheuristic search. We also describe potential applications of DBL to various subfields of machine learning and optimization.",0
"In pervasive computing environments, various entities often have to cooperate and integrate seamlessly in a \emph{situation} which can, thus, be considered as an amalgamation of the context of several entities interacting and coordinating with each other, and often performing one or more activities. However, none of the existing context models and ontologies address situation modeling. In this paper, we describe the design, structure and implementation of a generic, flexible and extensible context ontology called Rover Context Model Ontology (RoCoMO) for context and situation modeling in pervasive computing systems and environments. We highlight several limitations of the existing context models and ontologies, such as lack of provision for provenance, traceability, quality of context, multiple representation of contextual information, as well as support for security, privacy and interoperability, and explain how we are addressing these limitations in our approach. We also illustrate the applicability and utility of RoCoMO using a practical and extensive case study.",0
"This paper proposes a general framework to combine context and commonsense knowledge for solving the Winograd Schema (WS) and Pronoun Disambiguation Problems (PDP). In the proposed framework, commonsense knowledge bases (e.g. cause-effect word pairs) are quantized as knowledge constraints. The constraints guide us to learn knowledge enhanced embeddings (KEE) from large text corpus. Based on the pre-trained KEE models, this paper proposes two methods to solve the WS and PDP problems. The first method is an unsupervised method, which represents all the pronouns and candidate mentions in continuous vector spaces based on their contexts and calculates the semantic similarities between all the possible word pairs. The pronoun disambiguation procedure could then be implemented by comparing the semantic similarities between the pronoun (to be resolved) and all the candidate mentions. The second method is a supervised method, which extracts features for all the pronouns and candidate mentions and solves the WS problems by training a typical mention pair classification model. Similar to the first method, the features used in the second method are also extracted based on the KEE models. Experiments conducted on the available PDP and WS test sets show that, these two methods both achieve consistent improvements over the baseline systems. The best performance reaches 62\% in accuracy on the PDP test set of the first Winograd Schema Challenge.",0
"Sequential pattern mining (SPM) under gap constraint is a challenging task. Many efficient specialized methods have been developed but they are all suffering from a lack of genericity. The Constraint Programming (CP) approaches are not so effective because of the size of their encodings. In[7], we have proposed the global constraint Prefix-Projection for SPM which remedies to this drawback. However, this global constraint cannot be directly extended to support gap constraint. In this paper, we propose the global constraint GAP-SEQ enabling to handle SPM with or without gap constraint. GAP-SEQ relies on the principle of right pattern extensions. Experiments show that our approach clearly outperforms both CP approaches and the state-of-the-art cSpade method on large datasets.",0
"Proactive decision support (PDS) helps in improving the decision making experience of human decision makers in human-in-the-loop planning environments. Here both the quality of the decisions and the ease of making them are enhanced. In this regard, we propose a PDS framework, named RADAR, based on the research in Automated Planning in AI, that aids the human decision maker with her plan to achieve her goals by providing alerts on: whether such a plan can succeed at all, whether there exist any resource constraints that may foil her plan, etc. This is achieved by generating and analyzing the landmarks that must be accomplished by any successful plan on the way to achieving the goals. Note that, this approach also supports naturalistic decision making which is being acknowledged as a necessary element in proactive decision support, since it only aids the human decision maker through suggestions and alerts rather than enforcing fixed plans or decisions. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through search-and-rescue examples in a fire-fighting domain.",0
"We present a method for learning treewidth-bounded Bayesian networks from data sets containing thousands of variables. Bounding the treewidth of a Bayesian greatly reduces the complexity of inferences. Yet, being a global property of the graph, it considerably increases the difficulty of the learning process. We propose a novel algorithm for this task, able to scale to large domains and large treewidths. Our novel approach consistently outperforms the state of the art on data sets with up to ten thousand variables.",0
"We develop the theory and practice of an approach to modelling and probabilistic inference in causal networks that is suitable when application-specific or analysis-specific constraints should inform such inference or when little or no data for the learning of causal network structure or probability values at nodes are available. Constrained Bayesian Networks generalize a Bayesian Network such that probabilities can be symbolic, arithmetic expressions and where the meaning of the network is constrained by finitely many formulas from the theory of the reals. A formal semantics for constrained Bayesian Networks over first-order logic of the reals is given, which enables non-linear and non-convex optimisation algorithms that rely on decision procedures for this logic, and supports the composition of several constrained Bayesian Networks. A non-trivial case study in arms control, where few or no data are available to assess the effectiveness of an arms inspection process, evaluates our approach. An open-access prototype implementation of these foundations and their algorithms uses the SMT solver Z3 as decision procedure, leverages an open-source package for Bayesian inference to symbolic computation, and is evaluated experimentally.",0
"When autonomous agents are executing in the real world, the state of the world as well as the objectives of the agent may change from the agent's original model. In such cases, the agent's planning process must modify the plan under execution to make it amenable to the new conditions, and to resume execution. This brings up the replanning problem, and the various techniques that have been proposed to solve it. In all, three main techniques -- based on three different metrics -- have been proposed in prior automated planning work. An open question is whether these metrics are interchangeable; answering this requires a normalized comparison of the various replanning quality metrics. In this paper, we show that it is possible to support such a comparison by compiling all the respective techniques into a single substrate. Using this novel compilation, we demonstrate that these different metrics are not interchangeable, and that they are not good surrogates for each other. Thus we focus attention on the incompatibility of the various replanning flavors with each other, founded in the differences between the metrics that they respectively seek to optimize.",0
"We study truthful mechanisms for matching and related problems in a partial information setting, where the agents' true utilities are hidden, and the algorithm only has access to ordinal preference information. Our model is motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph of agent utilities, but the algorithm can only elicit the agents' private information in the form of a preference ordering for each agent induced by the underlying weights. Against this backdrop, we design truthful algorithms to approximate the true optimum solution with respect to the hidden weights. Our techniques yield universally truthful algorithms for a number of graph problems: a 1.76-approximation algorithm for Max-Weight Matching, 2-approximation algorithm for Max k-matching, a 6-approximation algorithm for Densest k-subgraph, and a 2-approximation algorithm for Max Traveling Salesman as long as the hidden weights constitute a metric. We also provide improved approximation algorithms for such problems when the agents are not able to lie about their preferences. Our results are the first non-trivial truthful approximation algorithms for these problems, and indicate that in many situations, we can design robust algorithms even when the agents may lie and only provide ordinal information instead of precise utilities.",0
"Representation learning and option discovery are two of the biggest challenges in reinforcement learning (RL). Proto-RL is a well known approach for representation learning in MDPs. The representations learned with this framework are called proto-value functions (PVFs). In this paper we address the option discovery problem by showing how PVFs implicitly define options. We do it by introducing eigenpurposes, intrinsic reward functions derived from the learned representations. The options discovered from eigenpurposes traverse the principal directions of the state space. They are useful for multiple tasks because they are independent of the agents' intentions. Moreover, by capturing the diffusion process of a random walk, different options act at different time scales, making them helpful for exploration strategies. We demonstrate features of eigenpurposes in traditional tabular domains as well as in Atari 2600 games.",1
"The ozone level prediction is an important task of air quality agencies of modern cities. In this paper, we design an ozone level alarm system (OLP) for Isfahan city and test it through the real word data from 1-1-2000 to 7-6-2011. We propose a computer based system with three inputs and single output. The inputs include three sensors of solar ultraviolet (UV), total solar radiation (TSR) and total ozone (O3). And the output of the system is the predicted O3 of the next day and the alarm massages. A developed artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is applied to determine the output, based on the inputs variables. For this issue, AI models, including supervised brain emotional learning (BEL), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), are compared in order to find the best model. The simulation of the proposed system shows that it can be used successfully in prediction of major cities ozone level.",0
We present initial ideas for a programming paradigm based on simulation that is targeted towards applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The approach aims at integrating techniques from different areas of AI and is based on the idea that simulated entities may freely exchange data and behavioural patterns. We define basic notions of a simulation-based programming paradigm and show how it can be used for implementing AI applications.,0
"Mean Field inference is central to statistical physics. It has attracted much interest in the Computer Vision community to efficiently solve problems expressible in terms of large Conditional Random Fields. However, since it models the posterior probability distribution as a product of marginal probabilities, it may fail to properly account for important dependencies between variables. We therefore replace the fully factorized distribution of Mean Field by a weighted mixture of such distributions, that similarly minimizes the KL-Divergence to the true posterior. By introducing two new ideas, namely, conditioning on groups of variables instead of single ones and using a parameter of the conditional random field potentials, that we identify to the temperature in the sense of statistical physics to select such groups, we can perform this minimization efficiently. Our extension of the clamping method proposed in previous works allows us to both produce a more descriptive approximation of the true posterior and, inspired by the diverse MAP paradigms, fit a mixture of Mean Field approximations. We demonstrate that this positively impacts real-world algorithms that initially relied on mean fields.",0
"Argumentation is a promising model for reasoning with uncertain knowledge. The key concept of acceptability enables to differentiate arguments and counterarguments: The certainty of a proposition can then be evaluated through the most acceptable arguments for that proposition. In this paper, we investigate different complementary points of view: - an acceptability based on the existence of direct counterarguments, - an acceptability based on the existence of defenders. Pursuing previous work on preference-based argumentation principles, we enforce both points of view by taking into account preference orderings for comparing arguments. Our approach is illustrated in the context of reasoning with stratified knowldge bases.",0
"Over the last two decades, propositional satisfiability (SAT) has become one of the most successful and widely applied techniques for the solution of NP-complete problems. The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how SAT can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and Cautious Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. We cannot transform these two reasoning problems to SAT in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.",1
"This paper reports the outcome of the third in the series of biennial international planning competitions, held in association with the International Conference on AI Planning and Scheduling (AIPS) in 2002. In addition to describing the domains, the planners and the objectives of the competition, the paper includes analysis of the results. The results are analysed from several perspectives, in order to address the questions of comparative performance between planners, comparative difficulty of domains, the degree of agreement between planners about the relative difficulty of individual problem instances and the question of how well planners scale relative to one another over increasingly difficult problems. The paper addresses these questions through statistical analysis of the raw results of the competition, in order to determine which results can be considered to be adequately supported by the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of some challenges for the future of the competition series.",0
"User ignorance towards the use of communication services like Instant Messengers, emails, websites, social networks etc. is becoming the biggest advantage for phishers. It is required to create technical awareness in users by educating them to create a phishing detection application which would generate phishing alerts for the user so that phishing messages are not ignored. The lack of basic security features to detect and prevent phishing has had a profound effect on the IM clients, as they lose their faith in e-banking and e-commerce transactions, which will have a disastrous impact on the corporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the internet. Very little research contributions were available in for phishing detection in Instant messengers. A context based, dynamic and intelligent phishing detection methodology in IMs is proposed, to analyze and detect phishing in Instant Messages with relevance to domain ontology (OBIE) and utilizes the Classification based on Association (CBA) for generating phishing rules and alerting the victims. A PDS Monitoring system algorithm is used to identify the phishing activity during exchange of messages in IMs, with high ratio of precision and recall. The results have shown improvement by the increased percentage of precision and recall when compared to the existing methods.",0
"In previous work, we proposed a logic-based framework in which computation is the execution of actions in an attempt to make reactive rules of the form if antecedent then consequent true in a canonical model of a logic program determined by an initial state, sequence of events, and the resulting sequence of subsequent states. In this model-theoretic semantics, reactive rules are the driving force, and logic programs play only a supporting role.",0
"We propose an active question answering agent that learns to reformulate questions and combine evidence to improve question answering. The agent sits between the user and a black box question-answering system and learns to optimally probe the system with natural language reformulations of the initial question and to aggregate the evidence to return the best possible answer. The system is trained end-to-end to maximize answer quality using policy gradient. We evaluate on SearchQA, a dataset of complex questions extracted from Jeopardy!. Our agent improves F1 by 11% over a state-of-the-art base model that uses the original question/answer pairs.",0
"The proliferation of contextualized knowledge in the Semantic Web (SW) has led to the popularity of knowledge formats such as \emph{quads} in the SW community. A quad is an extension of an RDF triple with contextual information of the triple. In this paper, we study the problem of query answering over quads augmented with forall-existential bridge rules that enable interoperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts. We call a set of quads together with such expressive bridge rules, a quad-system. Query answering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We derive decidable classes of quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward chaining. Sound, complete and terminating procedures, which are adaptations of the well known chase algorithm, are provided for these classes for deciding query entailment. Safe, msafe, and csafe class of quad-systems restrict the structure of blank nodes generated during the chase computation process to be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of bounded depth. RR and restricted RR classes do not allow the generation of blank nodes during the chase computation process. Both data and combined complexity of query entailment has been established for the classes derived. We further show that quad-systems are equivalent to forall-existential rules whose predicates are restricted to ternary arity, modulo polynomial time translations. We subsequently show that the technique of safety, strictly subsumes in expressivity, some of the well known and expressive techniques, such as joint acyclicity and model faithful acyclicity, used for decidability guarantees in the realm of forall-existential rules.",0
"Safe interaction with human drivers is one of the primary challenges for autonomous vehicles. In order to plan driving maneuvers effectively, the vehicle's control system must infer and predict how humans will behave based on their latent internal state (e.g., intentions and aggressiveness). This research uses a simple model for human behavior with unknown parameters that make up the internal states of the traffic participants and presents a method for quantifying the value of estimating these states and planning with their uncertainty explicitly modeled. An upper performance bound is established by an omniscient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner that has perfect knowledge of the internal states. A baseline lower bound is established by planning with MCTS assuming that all drivers have the same internal state. MCTS variants are then used to solve a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that models the internal state uncertainty to determine whether inferring the internal state offers an advantage over the baseline. Applying this method to a freeway lane changing scenario reveals that there is a significant performance gap between the upper bound and baseline. POMDP planning techniques come close to closing this gap, especially when important hidden model parameters are correlated with measurable parameters.",0
"Standard models of multi-agent modal logic do not capture the fact that information is often \emph{ambiguous}, and may be interpreted in different ways by different agents. We propose a framework that can model this, and consider different semantics that capture different assumptions about the agents' beliefs regarding whether or not there is ambiguity. We examine the expressive power of logics of ambiguity compared to logics that cannot model ambiguity, with respect to the different semantics that we propose.",0
"In this paper, we constructed a model to determine weights of criterias and presented a solution for determining the optimal alternative by using the constructed model and relationship analysis between criterias in fuzzy group decision-making problem with different forms of preference information of decision makers on criterias.",0
"Nonmonotonic causal logic, introduced by Norman McCain and Hudson Turner, became a basis for the semantics of several expressive action languages. McCain's embedding of definite propositional causal theories into logic programming paved the way to the use of answer set solvers for answering queries about actions described in such languages. In this paper we extend this embedding to nondefinite theories and to first-order causal logic.",0
"While decision theory provides an appealing normative framework for representing rich preference structures, eliciting utility or value functions typically incurs a large cost. For many applications involving interactive systems this overhead precludes the use of formal decision-theoretic models of preference. Instead of performing elicitation in a vacuum, it would be useful if we could augment directly elicited preferences with some appropriate default information. In this paper we propose a case-based approach to alleviating the preference elicitation bottleneck. Assuming the existence of a population of users from whom we have elicited complete or incomplete preference structures, we propose eliciting the preferences of a new user interactively and incrementally, using the closest existing preference structures as potential defaults. Since a notion of closeness demands a measure of distance among preference structures, this paper takes the first step of studying various distance measures over fully and partially specified preference structures. We explore the use of Euclidean distance, Spearmans footrule, and define a new measure, the probabilistic distance. We provide computational techniques for all three measures.",0
"Distributed knowledge is the sum of the knowledge in a group; what someone who is able to discern between two possible worlds whenever any member of the group can discern between them, would know. Sometimes distributed knowledge is referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, the formula D_G{\phi} is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of {\phi}, that there is enough information in the group to infer {\phi}. But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an operator R_G, such that R_G{\phi} means that {\phi} is true after G have shared all their information with each other - after G's distributed knowledge has been resolved. The R_G operators are called resolution operators. Semantically, we say that an expression R_G{\phi} is true iff {\phi} is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G's) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations.",0
"Many academic disciplines - including information systems, computer science, and operations management - face scheduling problems as important decision making tasks. Since many scheduling problems are NP-hard in the strong sense, there is a need for developing solution heuristics. For scheduling problems with setup times on unrelated parallel machines, there is limited research on solution methods and to the best of our knowledge, parallel computer architectures have not yet been taken advantage of. We address this gap by proposing and implementing a new solution heuristic and by testing different parallelization strategies. In our computational experiments, we show that our heuristic calculates near-optimal solutions even for large instances and that computing time can be reduced substantially by our parallelization approach.",0
"A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.",0
"Video captioning, the task of describing the content of a video, has seen some promising improvements in recent years with sequence-to-sequence models, but accurately learning the temporal and logical dynamics involved in the task still remains a challenge, especially given the lack of sufficient annotated data. We improve video captioning by sharing knowledge with two related directed-generation tasks: a temporally-directed unsupervised video prediction task to learn richer context-aware video encoder representations, and a logically-directed language entailment generation task to learn better video-entailing caption decoder representations. For this, we present a many-to-many multi-task learning model that shares parameters across the encoders and decoders of the three tasks. We achieve significant improvements and the new state-of-the-art on several standard video captioning datasets using diverse automatic and human evaluations. We also show mutual multi-task improvements on the entailment generation task.",1
"These notes pose a ""proof challenge"": a proof, or disproof, of the proposition that ""For any given body of information, I, expressed as a one-dimensional sequence of atomic symbols, a multiple alignment concept, described in the document, provides a means of encoding all the redundancy that may exist in I. Aspects of the challenge are described.",0
"We observe that certain large-clique graph triangulations can be useful to reduce both computational and space requirements when making queries on mixed stochastic/deterministic graphical models. We demonstrate that many of these large-clique triangulations are non-minimal and are thus unattainable via the variable elimination algorithm. We introduce ancestral pairs as the basis for novel triangulation heuristics and prove that no more than the addition of edges between ancestral pairs need be considered when searching for state space optimal triangulations in such graphs. Empirical results on random and real world graphs show that the resulting triangulations that yield significant speedups are almost always non-minimal. We also give an algorithm and correctness proof for determining if a triangulation can be obtained via elimination, and we show that the decision problem associated with finding optimal state space triangulations in this mixed stochastic/deterministic setting is NP-complete.",0
"In Passive POMDPs actions do not affect the world state, but still incur costs. When the agent is bounded by information-processing constraints, it can only keep an approximation of the belief. We present a variational principle for the problem of maintaining the information which is most useful for minimizing the cost, and introduce an efficient and simple algorithm for finding an optimum.",1
"A semi-automatic open-source tool for layout analysis on early printed books is presented. LAREX uses a rule based connected components approach which is very fast, easily comprehensible for the user and allows an intuitive manual correction if necessary. The PageXML format is used to support integration into existing OCR workflows. Evaluations showed that LAREX provides an efficient and flexible way to segment pages of early printed books.",0
"We present decentralized rollout sampling policy iteration (DecRSPI) - a new algorithm for multi-agent decision problems formalized as DEC-POMDPs. DecRSPI is designed to improve scalability and tackle problems that lack an explicit model. The algorithm uses Monte- Carlo methods to generate a sample of reachable belief states. Then it computes a joint policy for each belief state based on the rollout estimations. A new policy representation allows us to represent solutions compactly. The key benefits of the algorithm are its linear time complexity over the number of agents, its bounded memory usage and good solution quality. It can solve larger problems that are intractable for existing planning algorithms. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of the approach.",0
"We consider finite horizon Markov decision processes under performance measures that involve both the mean and the variance of the cumulative reward. We show that either randomized or history-based policies can improve performance. We prove that the complexity of computing a policy that maximizes the mean reward under a variance constraint is NP-hard for some cases, and strongly NP-hard for others. We finally offer pseudopolynomial exact and approximation algorithms.",1
"This paper describes the details of Sighthound's fully automated vehicle make, model and color recognition system. The backbone of our system is a deep convolutional neural network that is not only computationally inexpensive, but also provides state-of-the-art results on several competitive benchmarks. Additionally, our deep network is trained on a large dataset of several million images which are labeled through a semi-automated process. Finally we test our system on several public datasets as well as our own internal test dataset. Our results show that we outperform other methods on all benchmarks by significant margins. Our model is available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at",0
"We introduce a new interpretation of two related notions - conditional utility and utility independence. Unlike the traditional interpretation, the new interpretation renders the notions the direct analogues of their probabilistic counterparts. To capture these notions formally, we appeal to the notion of utility distribution, introduced in previous paper. We show that utility distributions, which have a structure that is identical to that of probability distributions, can be viewed as a special case of an additive multiattribute utility functions, and show how this special case permits us to capture the novel senses of conditional utility and utility independence. Finally, we present the notion of utility networks, which do for utilities what Bayesian networks do for probabilities. Specifically, utility networks exploit the new interpretation of conditional utility and utility independence to compactly represent a utility distribution.",0
"We consider the problem of learning a causal graph over a set of variables with interventions. We study the cost-optimal causal graph learning problem: For a given skeleton (undirected version of the causal graph), design the set of interventions with minimum total cost, that can uniquely identify any causal graph with the given skeleton. We show that this problem is solvable in polynomial time. Later, we consider the case when the number of interventions is limited. For this case, we provide polynomial time algorithms when the skeleton is a tree or a clique tree. For a general chordal skeleton, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm, which can be improved when the causal graph skeleton is an interval graph.",1
"Some of the applications of OWL and RDF (e.g. biomedical knowledge representation and semantic policy formulation) call for extensions of these languages with nonmonotonic constructs such as inheritance with overriding. Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-lite_R, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.",0
"This report covers an intelligent decision support system (IDSS), which handles an efficient and effective way to rapidly inspect containerized cargos for defection. Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc. The system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection. This new technique saves time and money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of running $n$ inspections on $n$ containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation or a ratio of $3:n$ is required, assuming $n &gt; 3$ containers. The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actually-damaged cargo by calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population. The estimated values on damaged, somewhat damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision. The report describes the problem domain and the implementation of the simulator prototype, showing how the system operates via software, hardware with/without human agents, conducting real-time inspections and management per se.",0
"Sequential data modeling and analysis have become indispensable tools for analyzing sequential data such as time-series data because a larger amount of sensed event data have become available. These methods capture the sequential structure of data of interest, such as input- output relationship and correlation among datasets. However, since most studies in this area are specialized or limited for their respective applications, rigorous requirement analysis on such a model has not been examined in a general point of view. Hence, we particularly examine the structure of sequential data, and extract the necessity of ""state duration"" and ""state duration"" of events for efficient and rich representation of sequential data. Specifically addressing the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents such state duration inside a model, we attempt to newly add representational capability of state interval of events onto HSMM. To this end, we propose two extended models; one is interval state hidden semi-Markov model (IS-HSMM) to express the length of state interval with a special state node designated as ""interval state node"". The other is interval length probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which repre- sents the length of state interval with a new probabilistic parameter ""interval length probability."" From exhaustive simulations, we show superior performances of the proposed models in comparison with HSMM. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed models are the first extensions of HMM to support state interval representation as well as state duration representation.",0
"The paper analyzes dynamic epistemic logic from a topological perspective. The main contribution consists of a framework in which dynamic epistemic logic satisfies the requirements for being a topological dynamical system thus interfacing discrete dynamic logics with continuous mappings of dynamical systems. The setting is based on a notion of logical convergence, demonstratively equivalent with convergence in Stone topology. Presented is a flexible, parametrized family of metrics inducing the latter, used as an analytical aid. We show maps induced by action model transformations continuous with respect to the Stone topology and present results on the recurrent behavior of said maps.",0
"STAN is a Graphplan-based planner, so-called because it uses a variety of STate ANalysis techniques to enhance its performance. STAN competed in the AIPS-98 planning competition where it compared well with the other competitors in terms of speed, finding solutions fastest to many of the problems posed. Although the domain analysis techniques STAN exploits are an important factor in its overall performance, we believe that the speed at which STAN solved the competition problems is largely due to the implementation of its plan graph. The implementation is based on two insights: that many of the graph construction operations can be implemented as bit-level logical operations on bit vectors, and that the graph should not be explicitly constructed beyond the fix point. This paper describes the implementation of STAN's plan graph and provides experimental results which demonstrate the circumstances under which advantages can be obtained from using this implementation.",0
"The content ranking problem in a social news website, is typically a function that maximizes a scalar metric of interest like dwell-time. However, like in most real-world applications we are interested in more than one metric---for instance simultaneously maximizing click-through rate, monetization metrics, dwell-time---and also satisfy the traffic requirements promised to different publishers. All this needs to be done on online data and under the settings where the objective function and the constraints can dynamically change; this could happen if for instance new publishers are added, some contracts are adjusted, or if some contracts are over.",0
"Interval temporal logics (ITLs) are logics for reasoning about temporal statements expressed over intervals, i.e., periods of time. The most famous ITL studied so far is Halpern and Shoham's HS, which is the logic of the thirteen Allen's interval relations. Unfortunately, HS and most of its fragments have an undecidable satisfiability problem. This discouraged the research in this area until recently, when a number non-trivial decidable ITLs have been discovered.",0
"This paper discusses a method for implementing a probabilistic inference system based on an extended relational data model. This model provides a unified approach for a variety of applications such as dynamic programming, solving sparse linear equations, and constraint propagation. In this framework, the probability model is represented as a generalized relational database. Subsequent probabilistic requests can be processed as standard relational queries. Conventional database management systems can be easily adopted for implementing such an approximate reasoning system.",0
"Traditional inconsistency-tolerent query answering in ontology-based data access relies on selecting maximal components of an ABox/database which are consistent with the ontology. However, some rules in ontologies might be unreliable if they are extracted from ontology learning or written by unskillful knowledge engineers. In this paper we present a framework of handling inconsistent existential rules under stable model semantics, which is defined by a notion called rule repairs to select maximal components of the existential rules. Surprisingly, for R-acyclic existential rules with R-stratified or guarded existential rules with stratified negations, both the data complexity and combined complexity of query answering under the rule {repair semantics} remain the same as that under the conventional query answering semantics. This leads us to propose several approaches to handle the rule {repair semantics} by calling answer set programming solvers. An experimental evaluation shows that these approaches have good scalability of query answering under rule repairs on realistic cases.",1
"Spoken dialogue systems promise efficient and natural access to a large variety of information sources and services from any phone. However, current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their strategies for preventing, identifying and repairing problems that arise in the conversation. This paper reports results on automatically training a Problematic Dialogue Predictor to predict problematic human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues collected with the 'How May I Help You' (SM) spoken dialogue system. The Problematic Dialogue Predictor can be immediately applied to the system's decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer care agent, or be used as a cue to the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We show that a Problematic Dialogue Predictor using automatically-obtainable features from the first two exchanges in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 13.2% more accurately than the baseline.",0
"Algorithm portfolios represent a strategy of composing multiple heuristic algorithms, each suited to a different class of problems, within a single general solver that will choose the best suited algorithm for each input. This approach recently gained popularity especially for solving combinatoric problems, but optimization applications are still emerging. The COCO platform of the BBOB workshop series is the current standard way to measure performance of continuous black-box optimization algorithms.",0
"We propose a novel rank aggregation method based on converting permutations into their corresponding Lehmer codes or other subdiagonal images. Lehmer codes, also known as inversion vectors, are vector representations of permutations in which each coordinate can take values not restricted by the values of other coordinates. This transformation allows for decoupling of the coordinates and for performing aggregation via simple scalar median or mode computations. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of this completely parallelizable approach and analytically prove that both the mode and median aggregation procedure recover the correct centroid aggregate with small sample complexity when the permutations are drawn according to the well-known Mallows models. The proposed Lehmer code approach may also be used on partial rankings, with similar performance guarantees.",0
"Data quality assessment and data cleaning are context-dependent activities. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Ontological Multidimensional Data Model (OMD model), which can be used to model and represent contexts as logic-based ontologies. The data under assessment is mapped into the context, for additional analysis, processing, and quality data extraction. The resulting contexts allow for the representation of dimensions, and multidimensional data quality assessment becomes possible. At the core of a multidimensional context we include a generalized multidimensional data model and a Datalog+/- ontology with provably good properties in terms of query answering. These main components are used to represent dimension hierarchies, dimensional constraints, dimensional rules, and define predicates for quality data specification. Query answering relies upon and triggers navigation through dimension hierarchies, and becomes the basic tool for the extraction of quality data. The OMD model is interesting per se, beyond applications to data quality. It allows for a logic-based, and computationally tractable representation of multidimensional data, extending previous multidimensional data models with additional expressive power and functionalities.",0
"In many probabilistic first-order representation systems, inference is performed by ""grounding""---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation, and then performing propositional inference. With a large database of facts, groundings can be very large, making inference and learning computationally expensive. Here we present a first-order probabilistic language which is well-suited to approximate ""local"" grounding: every query $Q$ can be approximately grounded with a small graph. The language is an extension of stochastic logic programs where inference is performed by a variant of personalized PageRank. Experimentally, we show that the approach performs well without weight learning on an entity resolution task; that supervised weight-learning improves accuracy; and that grounding time is independent of DB size. We also show that order-of-magnitude speedups are possible by parallelizing learning.",0
"We provide a survey on relational models. Relational models describe complete networked {domains by taking into account global dependencies in the data}. Relational models can lead to more accurate predictions if compared to non-relational machine learning approaches. Relational models typically are based on probabilistic graphical models, e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov networks, or latent variable models. Relational models have applications in social networks analysis, the modeling of knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, recommendation systems, natural language processing, medical decision support, and linked data.",0
"The World Wide Web no longer consists just of HTML pages. Our work sheds light on a number of trends on the Internet that go beyond simple Web pages. The hidden Web provides a wealth of data in semi-structured form, accessible through Web forms and Web services. These services, as well as numerous other applications on the Web, commonly use XML, the eXtensible Markup Language. XML has become the lingua franca of the Internet that allows customized markups to be defined for specific domains. On top of XML, the Semantic Web grows as a common structured data source. In this work, we first explain each of these developments in detail. Using real-world examples from scientific domains of great interest today, we then demonstrate how these new developments can assist the managing, harvesting, and organization of data on the Web. On the way, we also illustrate the current research avenues in these domains. We believe that this effort would help bridge multiple database tracks, thereby attracting researchers with a view to extend database technology.",0
"Random generators or stochastic engines are a key component in the structure of metaheuristic algorithms. This work investigates the effects of non-Gaussian stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when solving a real-world optimization problem. In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm (BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines). The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric. Detail discussions from various perspectives on the effects of non-Gaussian random generators in metaheuristics are provided.",0

"Since sequential information plays an important role in modeling user behaviors, various sequential recommendation methods have been proposed. Methods based on Markov assumption are widely-used, but independently combine several most recent components. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based methods have been successfully applied in several sequential modeling tasks. However, for real-world applications, these methods have difficulty in modeling the contextual information, which has been proved to be very important for behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware Recurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix and transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive context-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition matrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external situations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so on. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the transition of global sequential features. Experimental results show that the proposed CA-RNN model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods and context-aware recommendation methods on two public datasets, i.e., the Taobao dataset and the Movielens-1M dataset.",0
"Recent methods have adapted the well-established AGM and belief base frameworks for belief change to cover belief revision in logic programs. In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.",0
"There is growing interest in representing image data and feature descriptors using compact binary codes for fast near neighbor search. Although binary codes are motivated by their use as direct indices (addresses) into a hash table, codes longer than 32 bits are not being used as such, as it was thought to be ineffective. We introduce a rigorous way to build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact k-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space. The approach is straightforward to implement and storage efficient. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm exhibits sub-linear run-time behavior for uniformly distributed codes. Empirical results show dramatic speed-ups over a linear scan baseline for datasets of up to one billion codes of 64, 128, or 256 bits.",0
"We propose a new approach to value-directed belief state approximation for POMDPs. The value-directed model allows one to choose approximation methods for belief state monitoring that have a small impact on decision quality. Using a vector space analysis of the problem, we devise two new search procedures for selecting an approximation scheme that have much better computational properties than existing methods. Though these provide looser error bounds, we show empirically that they have a similar impact on decision quality in practice, and run up to two orders of magnitude more quickly.",0
"This paper introduce a software system including widely-used Swarm Intelligence algorithms or approaches to be used for the related scientific research studies associated with the subject area. The programmatic infrastructure of the system allows working on a fast, easy-to-use, interactive platform to perform Swarm Intelligence based studies in a more effective, efficient and accurate way. In this sense, the system employs all of the necessary controls for the algorithms and it ensures an interactive platform on which computer users can perform studies on a wide spectrum of solution approaches associated with simple and also more advanced problems.",0
"We address the problem of belief revision of logic programs, i.e., how to incorporate to a logic program P a new logic program Q. Based on the structure of SE interpretations, Delgrande et al. adapted the well-known AGM framework to logic program (LP) revision. They identified the rational behavior of LP revision and introduced some specific operators. In this paper, a constructive characterization of all rational LP revision operators is given in terms of orderings over propositional interpretations with some further conditions specific to SE interpretations. It provides an intuitive, complete procedure for the construction of all rational LP revision operators and makes easier the comprehension of their semantic and computational properties. We give a particular consideration to logic programs of very general form, i.e., the generalized logic programs (GLPs). We show that every rational GLP revision operator is derived from a propositional revision operator satisfying the original AGM postulates. Interestingly, the further conditions specific to GLP revision are independent from the propositional revision operator on which a GLP revision operator is based. Taking advantage of our characterization result, we embed the GLP revision operators into structures of Boolean lattices, that allow us to bring to light some potential weaknesses in the adapted AGM postulates. To illustrate our claim, we introduce and characterize axiomatically two specific classes of (rational) GLP revision operators which arguably have a drastic behavior. We additionally consider two more restricted forms of logic programs, i.e., the disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) and the normal logic programs (NLPs) and adapt our characterization result to DLP and NLP revision operators.",0
"A major problem of causal inference is the arrangement of dependent nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with path coefficients and observed confounders. Path coefficients do not provide the units to measure the strength of information flowing from one node to the other. Here we proposed the method of causal structure learning using collider v-structures (CVS) with Negative Percentage Mapping (NPM) to get selective thresholds of information strength, to direct the edges and subjective confounders in a DAG. The NPM is used to scale the strength of information passed through nodes in units of percentage from interval from 0 to 1. The causal structures are constructed by bottom up approach using path coefficients, causal directions and confounders, derived implementing collider v-structure and NPM. The method is self-sufficient to observe all the latent confounders present in the causal model and capable of detecting every responsible causal direction. The results are tested for simulated datasets of non-Gaussian distributions and compared with DirectLiNGAM and ICA-LiNGAM to check efficiency of the proposed method.",0
"We analyze how the knowledge to autonomously handle one type of intersection, represented as a Deep Q-Network, translates to other types of intersections (tasks). We view intersection handling as a deep reinforcement learning problem, which approximates the state action Q function as a deep neural network. Using a traffic simulator, we show that directly copying a network trained for one type of intersection to another type of intersection decreases the success rate. We also show that when a network that is pre-trained on Task A and then is fine-tuned on a Task B, the resulting network not only performs better on the Task B than an network exclusively trained on Task A, but also retained knowledge on the Task A. Finally, we examine a lifelong learning setting, where we train a single network on five different types of intersections sequentially and show that the resulting network exhibited catastrophic forgetting of knowledge on previous tasks. This result suggests a need for a long-term memory component to preserve knowledge.",0
"Probabilistic Inference Modulo Theories (PIMT) is a recent framework that expands exact inference on graphical models to use richer languages that include arithmetic, equalities, and inequalities on both integers and real numbers. In this paper, we expand PIMT to a lifted version that also processes random functions and relations. This enhancement is achieved by adapting Inversion, a method from Lifted First-Order Probabilistic Inference literature, to also be modulo theories. This results in the first algorithm for exact probabilistic inference that efficiently and simultaneously exploits random relations and functions, arithmetic, equalities and inequalities.",0
"We offer a new understanding of some aspects of practical SAT-solvers that are based on DPLL with unit-clause propagation, clause-learning, and restarts. We do so by analyzing a concrete algorithm which we claim is faithful to what practical solvers do. In particular, before making any new decision or restart, the solver repeatedly applies the unit-resolution rule until saturation, and leaves no component to the mercy of non-determinism except for some internal randomness. We prove the perhaps surprising fact that, although the solver is not explicitly designed for it, with high probability it ends up behaving as width-k resolution after no more than O(n^2k+2) conflicts and restarts, where n is the number of variables. In other words, width-k resolution can be thought of as O(n^2k+2) restarts of the unit-resolution rule with learning.",0
"Any probabilistic model of a problem is based on assumptions which, if violated, invalidate the model. Users of probability based decision aids need to be alerted when cases arise that are not covered by the aid's model. Diagnosis of model failure is also necessary to control dynamic model construction and revision. This paper presents a set of decision theoretically motivated heuristics for diagnosing situations in which a model is likely to provide an inadequate representation of the process being modeled.",0
"Making a decision is often a matter of listing and comparing positive and negative arguments. In such cases, the evaluation scale for decisions should be considered bipolar, that is, negative and positive values should be explicitly distinguished. That is what is done, for example, in Cumulative Prospect Theory. However, contraryto the latter framework that presupposes genuine numerical assessments, human agents often decide on the basis of an ordinal ranking of the pros and the cons, and by focusing on the most salient arguments. In other terms, the decision process is qualitative as well as bipolar. In this article, based on a bipolar extension of possibility theory, we define and axiomatically characterize several decision rules tailored for the joint handling of positive and negative arguments in an ordinal setting. The simplest rules can be viewed as extensions of the maximin and maximax criteria to the bipolar case, and consequently suffer from poor decisive power. More decisive rules that refine the former are also proposed. These refinements agree both with principles of efficiency and with the spirit of order-of-magnitude reasoning, that prevails in qualitative decision theory. The most refined decision rule uses leximin rankings of the pros and the cons, and the ideas of counting arguments of equal strength and cancelling pros by cons. It is shown to come down to a special case of Cumulative Prospect Theory, and to subsume the Take the Best heuristic studied by cognitive psychologists.",0
"Pathfinding is a very popular area in computer game development. While two-dimensional (2D) pathfinding is widely applied in most of the popular game engines, little implementation of real three-dimensional (3D) pathfinding can be found. This research presents a dynamic search space optimization algorithm which can be applied to tessellate 3D search space unevenly, significantly reducing the total number of resulting nodes. The algorithm can be used with popular pathfinding algorithms in 3D game engines. Furthermore, a simplified standalone 3D pathfinding algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm relies on ray-casting or line vision to generate a feasible path during runtime without requiring division of the search space into a 3D grid. Both of the proposed algorithms are simulated on Unreal Engine to show innerworkings and resultant path comparison with A*. The advantages and shortcomings of the proposed algorithms are also discussed along with future directions.",0
"A wide range of problems can be modelled as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms provided by a solver. Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global constraints, are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.",0
"Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement learning. Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games based on raw pixel data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw sensory inputs. However, it has been difficult to quantify progress in the domain of continuous control due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks, including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion, tasks with partial observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure. We report novel findings based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement learning algorithms. Both the benchmark and reference implementations are released open-source in order to facilitate experimental reproducibility and to encourage adoption by other researchers.",1
"We present locally complete inference rules for probabilistic deduction from taxonomic and probabilistic knowledge-bases over conjunctive events. Crucially, in contrast to similar inference rules in the literature, our inference rules are locally complete for conjunctive events and under additional taxonomic knowledge. We discover that our inference rules are extremely complex and that it is at first glance not clear at all where the deduced tightest bounds come from. Moreover, analyzing the global completeness of our inference rules, we find examples of globally very incomplete probabilistic deductions. More generally, we even show that all systems of inference rules for taxonomic and probabilistic knowledge-bases over conjunctive events are globally incomplete. We conclude that probabilistic deduction by the iterative application of inference rules on interval restrictions for conditional probabilities, even though considered very promising in the literature so far, seems very limited in its field of application.",0
"In spite of the recent improvements in the performance of the solvers based on the DPLL procedure, it is still possible for the search algorithm to focus on the wrong areas of the search space, preventing the solver from returning a solution in an acceptable amount of time. This prospect is a real concern e.g. in an industrial setting, where users typically expect consistent performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework that allows learning and using domain-specific heuristics in solvers based on the DPLL procedure. The learning is done off-line, on representative instances from the target domain, and the learned heuristics are then used for choice-point selection. In this paper we focus on Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers. In our experiments, the introduction of domain-specific heuristics improved performance on hard instances by up to 3 orders of magnitude (and 2 on average), nearly completely eliminating the cases in which the solver had to be terminated because the wait for an answer had become unacceptable.",0
"Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is an efficient mathematical tool to deal with uncertain information. In that theory, basic probability assignment (BPA) is the basic element for the expression and inference of uncertainty. Decision-making based on BPA is still an open issue in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. In this paper, a novel approach of transforming basic probability assignments to probabilities is proposed based on Deng entropy which is a new measure for the uncertainty of BPA. The principle of the proposed method is to minimize the difference of uncertainties involving in the given BPA and obtained probability distribution. Numerical examples are given to show the proposed approach.",0
"In this paper, we describe a case study in a big metropolis, in which from data collected by digital sensors, we tried to understand mobility patterns of persons using buses and how this can generate knowledge to suggest interventions that are applied incrementally into the transportation network in use. We have first estimated an Origin-Destination matrix of buses users from datasets about the ticket validation and GPS positioning of buses. Then we represent the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario and, in particular, applying community discovery techniques, to identify clusters that the service supply infrastructure has. Finally, from the superimposing of the flow of people represented in the OriginDestination matrix in the supply network, we exemplify how micro-interventions can be prospected by means of an example of the introduction of express routes.",0
"This paper proposes a new approach to model the temporal dynamics of a sequence of facial expressions. To this purpose, a sequence of Face Image Descriptors (FID) is regarded as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system. The temporal dynamics of such sequence of descriptors are represented by means of a Hankel matrix. The paper presents different strategies to compute dynamics-based representation of a sequence of FID, and reports classification accuracy values of the proposed representations within different standard classification frameworks. The representations have been validated in two very challenging application domains: emotion recognition and pain detection. Experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that the dynamics-based FID representation attains competitive performance when off-the-shelf classification tools are adopted.",0
"Unmanned aircraft have decreased the cost required to collect remote sensing imagery, which has enabled researchers to collect high-spatial resolution data from multiple sensor modalities more frequently and easily. The increase in data will push the need for semantic segmentation frameworks that are able to classify non-RGB imagery, but this type of algorithmic development requires an increase in publicly available benchmark datasets with class labels. In this paper, we introduce a high-resolution multispectral dataset with image labels. This new benchmark dataset has been pre-split into training/testing folds in order to standardize evaluation and continue to push state-of-the-art classification frameworks for non-RGB imagery.",0
"We consider the problem of identifying the causal direction between two discrete random variables using observational data. Unlike previous work, we keep the most general functional model but make an assumption on the unobserved exogenous variable: Inspired by Occam's razor, we assume that the exogenous variable is simple in the true causal direction. We quantify simplicity using R\'enyi entropy. Our main result is that, under natural assumptions, if the exogenous variable has low $H_0$ entropy (cardinality) in the true direction, it must have high $H_0$ entropy in the wrong direction. We establish several algorithmic hardness results about estimating the minimum entropy exogenous variable. We show that the problem of finding the exogenous variable with minimum entropy is equivalent to the problem of finding minimum joint entropy given $n$ marginal distributions, also known as minimum entropy coupling problem. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy coupling problem, that for $n=2$ provably finds a local optimum. This gives a greedy algorithm for finding the exogenous variable with minimum $H_1$ (Shannon Entropy). Our greedy entropy-based causal inference algorithm has similar performance to the state of the art additive noise models in real datasets. One advantage of our approach is that we make no use of the values of random variables but only their distributions. Our method can therefore be used for causal inference for both ordinal and also categorical data, unlike additive noise models.",1
"I suggest an approach that helps the online marketers to target their Gamification elements to users by modifying the order of the list of tasks that they send to users. It is more realistic and flexible as it allows the model to learn more parameters when the online marketers collect more data. The targeting approach is scalable and quick, and it can be used over streaming data.",0
"The problem of scheduling under resource constraints is widely applicable. One prominent example is power management, in which we have a limited continuous supply of power but must schedule a number of power-consuming tasks. Such problems feature tightly coupled continuous resource constraints and continuous temporal constraints.",0
"Weighted logic programming, a generalization of bottom-up logic programming, is a well-suited framework for specifying dynamic programming algorithms. In this setting, proofs correspond to the algorithm's output space, such as a path through a graph or a grammatical derivation, and are given a real-valued score (often interpreted as a probability) that depends on the real weights of the base axioms used in the proof. The desired output is a function over all possible proofs, such as a sum of scores or an optimal score. We describe the PRODUCT transformation, which can merge two weighted logic programs into a new one. The resulting program optimizes a product of proof scores from the original programs, constituting a scoring function known in machine learning as a ``product of experts.'' Through the addition of intuitive constraining side conditions, we show that several important dynamic programming algorithms can be derived by applying PRODUCT to weighted logic programs corresponding to simpler weighted logic programs. In addition, we show how the computation of Kullback-Leibler divergence, an information-theoretic measure, can be interpreted using PRODUCT.",0
"When using Bayesian networks for modelling the behavior of man-made machinery, it usually happens that a large part of the model is deterministic. For such Bayesian networks deterministic part of the model can be represented as a Boolean function, and a central part of belief updating reduces to the task of calculating the number of satisfying configurations in a Boolean function. In this paper we explore how advances in the calculation of Boolean functions can be adopted for belief updating, in particular within the context of troubleshooting. We present experimental results indicating a substantial speed-up compared to traditional junction tree propagation.",0
"In recent years the search for a proper formal definition of actual causation -- i.e., the relation of cause-effect as it is instantiated in specific observations, rather than general causal relations -- has taken on impressive proportions. In part this is due to the insight that this concept plays a fundamental role in many different fields, such as legal theory, engineering, medicine, ethics, etc. Because of this diversity in applications, some researchers have shifted focus from a single idealized definition towards a more pragmatic, context-based account. For instance, recent work by Halpern and Hitchcock draws on empirical research regarding people's causal judgments, to suggest a graded and context-sensitive notion of causation. Although we sympathize with many of their observations, their restriction to a merely qualitative ordering runs into trouble for more complex examples. Therefore we aim to improve on their approach, by using the formal language of CP-logic (Causal Probabilistic logic), and the framework for defining actual causation that was developed by the current authors using it. First we rephrase their ideas into our quantitative, probabilistic setting, after which we modify it to accommodate a greater class of examples. Further, we introduce a formal distinction between statistical and normative considerations.",0
"The aim of this paper is to investigate the interplay between knowledge shared by a group of agents and its coalition ability. We characterize this relation in the standard context of imperfect information concurrent game. We assume that whenever a set of agents form a coalition to achieve a goal, they share their knowledge before acting. Based on this assumption, we propose new semantics for alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information and perfect recall. It turns out that this semantics is sufficient to preserve all the desirable properties of coalition ability in traditional coalitional logics. Meanwhile, we investigate how knowledge sharing within a group of agents contributes to its coalitional ability through the interplay of epistemic and coalition modalities. This work provides a partial answer to the question: which kind of group knowledge is required for a group to achieve their goals in the context of imperfect information.",0
"It is known that benign looking AI objectives may result in powerful AI drives that may pose a risk to the human society. We examine the alternative scenario of what happens when universal goals that are not human-centric are used for designing AI agents. We follow a design approach that tries to exclude malevolent motivations from AI's, however, we see that even objectives that seem benevolent at first may pose significant risk to humanity. We also discuss various solution approaches including selfless goals, hybrid designs, universal constraints, and generalization of robot laws.",0
"In this document, we introduce a new dataset designed for training machine learning models of symbolic music data. Five datasets are provided, one of which is from a newly collected corpus of 20K midi files. We describe our preprocessing and cleaning pipeline, which includes the exclusion of a number of files based on scores from a previously developed probabilistic machine learning model. We also define training, testing and validation splits for the new dataset, based on a clustering scheme which we also describe. Some simple histograms are included.",0
"Significant efforts have been made to understand and document knowledge related to scientific measurements. Many of those efforts resulted in one or more high-quality ontologies that describe some aspects of scientific measurements, but not in a comprehensive and coherently integrated manner. For instance, we note that many of these high-quality ontologies are not properly aligned, and more challenging, that they have different and often conflicting concepts and approaches for encoding knowledge about empirical measurements. As a result of this lack of an integrated view, it is often challenging for scientists to determine whether any two scientific measurements were taken in semantically compatible manners, thus making it difficult to decide whether measurements should be analyzed in combination or not. In this paper, we present the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology that is a comprehensive alignment and integration of a sensing infrastructure ontology and a provenance ontology. HASNetO has been under development for more than one year, and has been reviewed, shared and used by multiple scientific communities. The ontology has been in use to support the data management of a number of large-scale ecological monitoring activities (observations) and empirical experiments.",0
"We study the problem of rewriting a disjunctive datalog program into plain datalog. We show that a disjunctive program is rewritable if and only if it is equivalent to a linear disjunctive program, thus providing a novel characterisation of datalog rewritability. Motivated by this result, we propose weakly linear disjunctive datalog---a novel rule-based KR language that extends both datalog and linear disjunctive datalog and for which reasoning is tractable in data complexity. We then explore applications of weakly linear programs to ontology reasoning and propose a tractable extension of OWL 2 RL with disjunctive axioms. Our empirical results suggest that many non-Horn ontologies can be reduced to weakly linear programs and that query answering over such ontologies using a datalog engine is feasible in practice.",1
"With the increasing popularity of online learning, intelligent tutoring systems are regaining increased attention. In this paper, we introduce adaptive algorithms for personalized assignment of learning tasks to student so that to improve his performance in online learning environments. As main contribution of this paper, we propose a a novel Skill-Based Task Selector (SBTS) algorithm which is able to approximate a student's skill level based on his performance and consequently suggest adequate assignments. The SBTS is inspired by the class of multi-armed bandit algorithms. However, in contrast to standard multi-armed bandit approaches, the SBTS aims at acquiring two criteria related to student learning, namely: which topics should the student work on, and what level of difficulty should the task be. The SBTS centers on innovative reward and punishment schemes in a task and skill matrix based on the student behaviour.",0
"Catastrophic forgetting is of special importance in reinforcement learning, as the data distribution is generally non-stationary over time. We study and compare several pseudorehearsal approaches for Q-learning with function approximation in a pole balancing task. We have found that pseudorehearsal seems to assist learning even in such very simple problems, given proper initialization of the rehearsal parameters.",0
"We present in this article the model Function-described graph (FDG), which is a type of compact representation of a set of attributed graphs (AGs) that borrow from Random Graphs the capability of probabilistic modelling of structural and attribute information. We define the FDGs, their features and two distance measures between AGs (unclassified patterns) and FDGs (models or classes) and we also explain an efficient matching algorithm. Two applications of FDGs are presented: in the former, FDGs are used for modelling and matching 3D-objects described by multiple views, whereas in the latter, they are used for representing and recognising human faces, described also by several views.",0
"The graphoid axioms for conditional independence, originally described by Dawid [1979], are fundamental to probabilistic reasoning [Pearl, 19881. Such axioms provide a mechanism for manipulating conditional independence assertions without resorting to their numerical definition. This paper explores a representation for independence statements using multiple undirected graphs and some simple graphical transformations. The independence statements derivable in this system are equivalent to those obtainable by the graphoid axioms. Therefore, this is a purely graphical proof technique for conditional independence.",0
"A standard objective in partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is to find a policy that maximizes the expected discounted-sum payoff. However, such policies may still permit unlikely but highly undesirable outcomes, which is problematic especially in safety-critical applications. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in POMDPs where the goal is to maximize the probability to ensure that the payoff is at least a given threshold, but these approaches do not consider any optimization beyond satisfying this threshold constraint. In this work we go beyond both the ""expectation"" and ""threshold"" approaches and consider a ""guaranteed payoff optimization (GPO)"" problem for POMDPs, where we are given a threshold $t$ and the objective is to find a policy $\sigma$ such that a) each possible outcome of $\sigma$ yields a discounted-sum payoff of at least $t$, and b) the expected discounted-sum payoff of $\sigma$ is optimal (or near-optimal) among all policies satisfying a). We present a practical approach to tackle the GPO problem and evaluate it on standard POMDP benchmarks.",0
"We present a new decision rule, \emph{maximin safety}, that seeks to maintain a large margin from the worst outcome, in much the same way minimax regret seeks to minimize distance from the best. We argue that maximin safety is valuable both descriptively and normatively. Descriptively, maximin safety explains the well-known \emph{decoy effect}, in which the introduction of a dominated option changes preferences among the other options. Normatively, we provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by maximin safety, and show that maximin safety shares much of the same behavioral basis with minimax regret.",0
"Distributed knowledge based applications in open domain rely on common sense information which is bound to be uncertain and incomplete. To draw the useful conclusions from ambiguous data, one must address uncertainties and conflicts incurred in a holistic view. No integrated frameworks are viable without an in-depth analysis of conflicts incurred by uncertainties. In this paper, we give such an analysis and based on the result, propose an integrated framework. Our framework extends definite argumentation theory to model uncertainty. It supports three views over conflicting and uncertain knowledge. Thus, knowledge engineers can draw different conclusions depending on the application context (i.e. view). We also give an illustrative example on strategical decision support to show the practical usefulness of our framework.",0
"Visual features can help predict if a manipulation behavior will succeed at a given location. For example, the success of a behavior that flips light switches depends on the location of the switch. Within this paper, we present methods that enable a mobile manipulator to autonomously learn a function that takes an RGB image and a registered 3D point cloud as input and returns a 3D location at which a manipulation behavior is likely to succeed. Given a pair of manipulation behaviors that can change the state of the world between two sets (e.g., light switch up and light switch down), classifiers that detect when each behavior has been successful, and an initial hint as to where one of the behaviors will be successful, the robot autonomously trains a pair of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers by trying out the behaviors at locations in the world and observing the results. When an image feature vector associated with a 3D location is provided as input to one of the SVMs, the SVM predicts if the associated manipulation behavior will be successful at the 3D location. To evaluate our approach, we performed experiments with a PR2 robot from Willow Garage in a simulated home using behaviors that flip a light switch, push a rocker-type light switch, and operate a drawer. By using active learning, the robot efficiently learned SVMs that enabled it to consistently succeed at these tasks. After training, the robot also continued to learn in order to adapt in the event of failure.",0
"We study logic for reasoning with if-then formulas describing dependencies between attributes of objects which are observed in consecutive points in time. We introduce semantic entailment of the formulas, show its fixed-point characterization, investigate closure properties of model classes, present an axiomatization and prove its completeness, and investigate alternative axiomatizations and normalized proofs. We investigate decidability and complexity issues of the logic and prove NP-hardness of the entailment problem. We show that by restricting to predictive formulas, the entailment problem is decidable in pseudo-linear time.",0
"Acoustic event detection for content analysis in most cases relies on lots of labeled data. However, manually annotating data is a time-consuming task, which thus makes few annotated resources available so far. Unlike audio event detection, automatic audio tagging, a multi-label acoustic event classification task, only relies on weakly labeled data. This is highly desirable to some practical applications using audio analysis. In this paper we propose to use a fully deep neural network (DNN) framework to handle the multi-label classification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level rather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames of the chunk were fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the expected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can well map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. A deep pyramid structure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related to the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the Dropout and background noise aware training, to enhance its generalization capability for new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods, the proposed fully DNN-based method could well utilize the long-term temporal information with the whole chunk as the input. The results show that our approach obtained a 15% relative improvement compared with the official GMM-based method of DCASE 2016 challenge.",0
"Very large commonsense knowledge bases (KBs) often have thousands to millions of axioms, of which relatively few are relevant for answering any given query. A large number of irrelevant axioms can easily overwhelm resolution-based theorem provers. Therefore, methods that help the reasoner identify useful inference paths form an essential part of large-scale reasoning systems. In this paper, we describe two ordering heuristics for optimization of reasoning in such systems. First, we discuss how decision trees can be used to select inference steps that are more likely to succeed. Second, we identify a small set of problem instance features that suffice to guide searches away from intractable regions of the search space. We show the efficacy of these techniques via experiments on thousands of queries from the Cyc KB. Results show that these methods lead to an order of magnitude reduction in inference time.",0
"A standard approach to approximate inference in state-space models isto apply a particle filter, e.g., the Condensation Algorithm.However, the performance of particle filters often varies significantlydue to their stochastic nature.We present a class of algorithms, called lattice particle filters, thatcircumvent this difficulty by placing the particles deterministicallyaccording to a Quasi-Monte Carlo integration rule.We describe a practical realization of this idea, discuss itstheoretical properties, and its efficiency.Experimental results with a synthetic 2D tracking problem show that thelattice particle filter is equivalent to a conventional particle filterthat has between 10 and 60% more particles, depending ontheir ""sparsity"" in the state-space.We also present results on inferring 3D human motion frommoving light displays.",0
"The solution of the biobjective IRP is rather challenging, even for metaheuristics. We are still lacking a profound understanding of appropriate solution representations and effective neighborhood structures. Clearly, both the delivery volumes and the routing aspects of the alternatives need to be reflected in an encoding, and must be modified when searching by means of local search. Our work contributes to the better understanding of such solution representations. On the basis of an experimental investigation, the advantages and drawbacks of two encodings are studied and compared.",0
"Most Relevant Explanation (MRE) is a method for finding multivariate explanations for given evidence in Bayesian networks [12]. This paper studies the theoretical properties of MRE and develops an algorithm for finding multiple top MRE solutions. Our study shows that MRE relies on an implicit soft relevance measure in automatically identifying the most relevant target variables and pruning less relevant variables from an explanation. The soft measure also enables MRE to capture the intuitive phenomenon of explaining away encoded in Bayesian networks. Furthermore, our study shows that the solution space of MRE has a special lattice structure which yields interesting dominance relations among the solutions. A K-MRE algorithm based on these dominance relations is developed for generating a set of top solutions that are more representative. Our empirical results show that MRE methods are promising approaches for explanation in Bayesian networks.",0
"We propose to accelerate the rate of convergence of the pattern recognition task by directly minimizing the variance diameters of certain hypothesis spaces, which are critical quantities in fast-convergence results.We show that the variance diameters can be controlled by dividing hypothesis spaces into metric balls based on a new order metric. This order metric can be minimized as an ordinal regression problem, leading to a LUPI (Learning Using Privileged Information) application where we take the privileged information as some desired ordering, and construct a faster-converging hypothesis space by empirically restricting some larger hypothesis space according to that ordering. We give a risk analysis of the approach. We discuss the difficulties with model selection and give an innovative technique for selecting multiple model parameters. Finally, we provide some data experiments.",0
"Extracting geographical tags from webpages is a well-motivated application in many domains. In illicit domains with unusual language models, like human trafficking, extracting geotags with both high precision and recall is a challenging problem. In this paper, we describe a geotag extraction framework in which context, constraints and the openly available Geonames knowledge base work in tandem in an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to achieve good performance. In preliminary empirical investigations, the framework improves precision by 28.57% and F-measure by 36.9% on a difficult human trafficking geotagging task compared to a machine learning-based baseline. The method is already being integrated into an existing knowledge base construction system widely used by US law enforcement agencies to combat human trafficking.",0
"MAX-SAT heuristics normally operate from random initial truth assignments to the variables. We consider the use of what we call preambles, which are sequences of variables with corresponding single-variable assignment actions intended to be used to determine a more suitable initial truth assignment for a given problem instance and a given heuristic. For a number of well established MAX-SAT heuristics and benchmark instances, we demonstrate that preambles can be evolved by a genetic algorithm such that the heuristics are outperformed in a significant fraction of the cases.",0
"Description Logics are knowledge representation formalisms that provide, for example, the logical underpinning of the W3C OWL standards. Conjunctive queries, the standard query language in databases, have recently gained significant attention as an expressive formalism for querying Description Logic knowledge bases. Several different techniques for deciding conjunctive query entailment are available for a wide range of DLs. Nevertheless, the combination of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions in OWL 1 and OWL 2 DL causes unsolvable problems for the techniques hitherto available. We tackle this problem and present a decidability result for entailment of unions of conjunctive queries in the DL ALCHOIQb that contains all three problematic constructors simultaneously. Provided that queries contain only simple roles, our result also shows decidability of entailment of (unions of) conjunctive queries in the logic that underpins OWL 1 DL and we believe that the presented results will pave the way for further progress towards conjunctive query entailment decision procedures for the Description Logics underlying the OWL standards.",0
"Recognizing handwritten mathematics is a challenging classification problem, requiring simultaneous identification of all the symbols comprising an input as well as the complex two-dimensional relationships between symbols and subexpressions. Because of the ambiguity present in handwritten input, it is often unrealistic to hope for consistently perfect recognition accuracy. We present a system which captures all recognizable interpretations of the input and organizes them in a parse forest from which individual parse trees may be extracted and reported. If the top-ranked interpretation is incorrect, the user may request alternates and select the recognition result they desire. The tree extraction step uses a novel probabilistic tree scoring strategy in which a Bayesian network is constructed based on the structure of the input, and each joint variable assignment corresponds to a different parse tree. Parse trees are then reported in order of decreasing probability. Two accuracy evaluations demonstrate that the resulting recognition system is more accurate than previous versions (which used non-probabilistic methods) and other academic math recognizers.",0
"The ability to know in advance the trend of running process instances, with respect to different features, such as the expected completion time, would allow business managers to timely counteract to undesired situations, in order to prevent losses. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict future features of running business process instances would be a very helpful aid when managing processes, especially under service level agreement constraints. However, making such accurate forecasts is not easy: many factors may influence the predicted features.",0
"Galles and Pearl claimed that ""for recursive models, the causal model framework does not add any restrictions to counterfactuals, beyond those imposed by Lewis's [possible-worlds] framework."" This claim is examined carefully, with the goal of clarifying the exact relationship between causal models and Lewis's framework. Recursive models are shown to correspond precisely to a subclass of (possible-world) counterfactual structures. On the other hand, a slight generalization of recursive models, models where all equations have unique solutions, is shown to be incomparable in expressive power to counterfactual structures, despite the fact that the Galles and Pearl arguments should apply to them as well. The problem with the Galles and Pearl argument is identified: an axiom that they viewed as irrelevant, because it involved disjunction (which was not in their language), is not irrelevant at all.",0
"Most real-world dynamic systems are composed of different components that often evolve at very different rates. In traditional temporal graphical models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, time is modeled at a fixed granularity, generally selected based on the rate at which the fastest component evolves. Inference must then be performed at this fastest granularity, potentially at significant computational cost. Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) avoid time-slicing in the representation by modeling the system as evolving continuously over time. The expectation-propagation (EP) inference algorithm of Nodelman et al. (2005) can then vary the inference granularity over time, but the granularity is uniform across all parts of the system, and must be selected in advance. In this paper, we provide a new EP algorithm that utilizes a general cluster graph architecture where clusters contain distributions that can overlap in both space (set of variables) and time. This architecture allows different parts of the system to be modeled at very different time granularities, according to their current rate of evolution. We also provide an information-theoretic criterion for dynamically re-partitioning the clusters during inference to tune the level of approximation to the current rate of evolution. This avoids the need to hand-select the appropriate granularity, and allows the granularity to adapt as information is transmitted across the network. We present experiments demonstrating that this approach can result in significant computational savings.",0
"Although there are increasingly more initiatives for the generation of semantic knowledge based on user participation, there is still a shortage of platforms for regular users to create applications on which semantic data can be exploited and generated automatically. We propose an architecture, called Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people about events they want to share with others typically participating in their social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was applied in a crowd map authoring tool.",0
"In a deterministic world, a planning agent can be certain of the consequences of its planned sequence of actions. Not so, however, in dynamic, stochastic domains where Markov decision processes are commonly used. Unfortunately these suffer from the curse of dimensionality: if the state space is a Cartesian product of many small sets (dimensions), planning is exponential in the number of those dimensions.",0
"The rise of multi-million-item dataset initiatives has enabled data-hungry machine learning algorithms to reach near-human semantic classification at tasks such as object and scene recognition. Here we describe the Places Database, a repository of 10 million scene photographs, labeled with scene semantic categories and attributes, comprising a quasi-exhaustive list of the types of environments encountered in the world. Using state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks, we provide impressive baseline performances at scene classification. With its high-coverage and high-diversity of exemplars, the Places Database offers an ecosystem to guide future progress on currently intractable visual recognition problems.",0
"While the basic laws of Newtonian mechanics are well understood, explaining a physical scenario still requires manually modeling the problem with suitable equations and associated parameters. In order to adopt such models for artificial intelligence, researchers have handcrafted the relevant states, and then used neural networks to learn the state transitions using simulation runs as training data. Unfortunately, such approaches can be unsuitable for modeling complex real-world scenarios, where manually authoring relevant state spaces tend to be challenging. In this work, we investigate if neural networks can implicitly learn physical states of real-world mechanical processes only based on visual data, and thus enable long-term physical extrapolation. We develop a recurrent neural network architecture for this task and also characterize resultant uncertainties in the form of evolving variance estimates. We evaluate our setup to extrapolate motion of a rolling ball on bowl of varying shape and orientation using only images as input, and report competitive results with approaches that assume access to internal physics models and parameters.",0
"In classification of incomplete pattern, the missing values can either play a crucial role in the class determination, or have only little influence (or eventually none) on the classification results according to the context. We propose a credal classification method for incomplete pattern with adaptive imputation of missing values based on belief function theory. At first, we try to classify the object (incomplete pattern) based only on the available attribute values. As underlying principle, we assume that the missing information is not crucial for the classification if a specific class for the object can be found using only the available information. In this case, the object is committed to this particular class. However, if the object cannot be classified without ambiguity, it means that the missing values play a main role for achieving an accurate classification. In this case, the missing values will be imputed based on the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and self-organizing map (SOM) techniques, and the edited pattern with the imputation is then classified. The (original or edited) pattern is respectively classified according to each training class, and the classification results represented by basic belief assignments are fused with proper combination rules for making the credal classification. The object is allowed to belong with different masses of belief to the specific classes and meta-classes (which are particular disjunctions of several single classes). The credal classification captures well the uncertainty and imprecision of classification, and reduces effectively the rate of misclassifications thanks to the introduction of meta-classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to other classical methods is demonstrated based on several experiments using artificial and real data sets.",0
"The emergence of collective dynamics in neural networks is a mechanism of the animal and human brain for information processing. In this paper, we develop a computational technique of distributed processing elements, which are called particles. We observe the collective dynamics of particles in a complex network for transductive inference on semi-supervised learning problems. Three actions govern the particles' dynamics: walking, absorption, and generation. Labeled vertices generate new particles that compete against rival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the network until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently dominated by rival particles. The result from the model simulation consists of sets of edges sorted by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a connected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics of the model is a stochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version with largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with subquadratic growth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding map. Intuitively, edges ""stretch"" and ""shrink"" according to edge dynamics. Consequently, such effect summarizes the relevant relationships between vertices and uncovered data classes. The proposed model captures important details of connectivity patterns over the edge dynamics evolution, which contrasts with previous approaches focused on vertex dynamics. Computer simulations reveal that our model can identify nonlinear features in both real and artificial data, including boundaries between distinct classes and the overlapping structure of data.",0
"Participatory democracy advances in virtually all governments. South America presents a prominent context with mixed culture and social predisposition. In 2012, civil, academic and governmental parties started elaborating the ""Common Vocabulary of Social Participation"" (\vcps\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Vocabul\'ario Comum de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}), as a public and online process. By May, 2013, first reference documents were publicized, together with a preliminary \owl\ code, logos, and a diagram of a general ""public consultation"". The \corais\ platform kept online records of the process, like discussions and preparation of texts. This article exposes this material and proposes an elementary unfolding: the ""Social Participation Ontology"" (\ops\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Ontologia de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}). To exhibit this new ontology, these steps were considered: correction of ontological contradictions and \owl\ protocol use errors; completion of \vcps\ \owl\ code into a preliminary version of the \ops; translations and standardizations; enhancements of class names and labels in Portuguese, Spanish and English; a toy expansion of the ontology by further specifying classes; linked data examples regarding dereferencing, a \sparql\ endpoint and participatory instances; use cases by researchers and public managers. Ongoing work involves further adoption of \ops\ by the official Brazilian federal portal of social participation, further adoption by civil participative organizations, and linkage to other participative ontologies. \ops\ is being used as an upper ontology, and all classes linked further to \foaf\ and \bfo\ as higher upper ontologies.",0
"A recommender system is an information filtering technology which can be used to predict preference ratings of items (products, services, movies, etc) and/or to output a ranking of items that are likely to be of interest to the user. Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) learn and predict the tastes and preferences of users by incorporating available contextual information in the recommendation process. One of the major challenges in context-aware recommender systems research is the lack of automatic methods to obtain contextual information for these systems. Considering this scenario, in this paper, we propose to use contextual information from topic hierarchies of the items (web pages) to improve the performance of context-aware recommender systems. The topic hierarchies are constructed by an extension of the LUPI-based Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method that considers three types of information: traditional bag-of-words (technical information), and the combination of named entities (privileged information I) with domain terms (privileged information II). We evaluated the contextual information in four context-aware recommender systems. Different weights were assigned to each type of information. The empirical results demonstrated that topic hierarchies with the combination of the two kinds of privileged information can provide better recommendations.",0
"Reactive answer set programming has paved the way for incorporating online information into operative solving processes. Although this technology was originally devised for dealing with data streams in dynamic environments, like assisted living and cognitive robotics, it can likewise be used to incorporate facts, rules, or queries provided by a user. As a result, we present the design and implementation of a system for interactive query answering with reactive answer set programming. Our system quontroller is based on the reactive solver oclingo and implemented as a dedicated front-end. We describe its functionality and implementation, and we illustrate its features by some selected use cases.",0
"Given the limited performance of 2D cellular automata in terms of space when the number of documents increases and in terms of visualization clusters, our motivation was to experiment these cellular automata by increasing the size to view the impact of size on quality of results. The representation of textual data was carried out by a vector model whose components are derived from the overall balancing of the used corpus, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The WorldNet thesaurus has been used to address the problem of the lemmatization of the words because the representation used in this study is that of the bags of words. Another independent method of the language was used to represent textual records is that of the n-grams. Several measures of similarity have been tested. To validate the classification we have used two measures of assessment based on the recall and precision (f-measure and entropy). The results are promising and confirm the idea to increase the dimension to the problem of the spatiality of the classes. The results obtained in terms of purity class (i.e. the minimum value of entropy) shows that the number of documents over longer believes the results are better for 3D cellular automata, which was not obvious to the 2D dimension. In terms of spatial navigation, cellular automata provide very good 3D performance visualization than 2D cellular automata.",0
"In built infrastructure monitoring, an efficient path planning algorithm is essential for robotic inspection of large surfaces using computer vision. In this work, we first formulate the inspection path planning problem as an extended travelling salesman problem (TSP) in which both the coverage and obstacle avoidance were taken into account. An enhanced discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm is then proposed to solve the TSP, with performance improvement by using deterministic initialization, random mutation, and edge exchange. Finally, we take advantage of parallel computing to implement the DPSO in a GPU-based framework so that the computation time can be significantly reduced while keeping the hardware requirement unchanged. To show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experimental results are included for datasets obtained from UAV inspection of an office building and a bridge.",0
"The probability density function of a probability distribution is a fundamental concept in probability theory and a key ingredient in various widely used machine learning methods. However, the necessary framework for compiling probabilistic functional programs to density functions has only recently been developed. In this work, we present a density compiler for a probabilistic language with failure and both discrete and continuous distributions, and provide a proof of its soundness. The compiler greatly reduces the development effort of domain experts, which we demonstrate by solving inference problems from various scientific applications, such as modelling the global carbon cycle, using a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo framework.",0
"Real-time strategy (RTS) games make heavy use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the design of computerized opponents. Because of the computational complexity involved in managing all aspects of these games, many AI opponents are designed to optimize only a few areas of playing style. In games like StarCraft 2, a very popular and recently released RTS, most AI strategies revolve around economic and building efficiency: AI opponents try to gather and spend all resources as quickly and effectively as possible while ensuring that no units are idle. The aim of this work was to help address the need for AI combat strategies that are not computationally intensive. Our goal was to produce a computationally efficient model that is accurate at predicting the results of complex battles between diverse armies, including which army will win and how many units will remain. Our results suggest it may be possible to develop a relatively simple approximation model of combat that can accurately predict many battles that do not involve micromanagement. Future designs of AI opponents may be able to incorporate such an approximation model into their decision and planning systems to provide a challenge that is strategically balanced across all aspects of play.",0
"In many professional sports leagues, teams from opposing leagues/conferences compete against one another, playing inter-league games. This is an example of a bipartite tournament. In this paper, we consider the problem of reducing the total travel distance of bipartite tournaments, by analyzing inter-league scheduling from the perspective of discrete optimization. This research has natural applications to sports scheduling, especially for leagues such as the National Basketball Association (NBA) where teams must travel long distances across North America to play all their games, thus consuming much time, money, and greenhouse gas emissions. We introduce the Bipartite Traveling Tournament Problem (BTTP), the inter-league variant of the well-studied Traveling Tournament Problem. We prove that the 2n-team BTTP is NP-complete, but for small values of n, a distance-optimal inter-league schedule can be generated from an algorithm based on minimum-weight 4-cycle-covers. We apply our theoretical results to the 12-team Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league in Japan, producing a provably-optimal schedule requiring 42950 kilometres of total team travel, a 16% reduction compared to the actual distance traveled by these teams during the 2010 NPB season. We also develop a nearly-optimal inter-league tournament for the 30-team NBA league, just 3.8% higher than the trivial theoretical lower bound.",0
"While humor has been historically studied from a psychological, cognitive and linguistic standpoint, its study from a computational perspective is an area yet to be explored in Computational Linguistics. There exist some previous works, but a characterization of humor that allows its automatic recognition and generation is far from being specified. In this work we build a crowdsourced corpus of labeled tweets, annotated according to its humor value, letting the annotators subjectively decide which are humorous. A humor classifier for Spanish tweets is assembled based on supervised learning, reaching a precision of 84% and a recall of 69%.",0
"This paper describes a new approach allowing the generation of a simplified Biped gait. This approach combines a classical dynamic modeling with an inverse kinematics' solver based on particle swarm optimization, PSO. First, an inverted pendulum, IP, is used to obtain a simplified dynamic model of the robot and to compute the target position of a key point in biped locomotion, the Centre Of Mass, COM. The proposed algorithm, called IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, returns and inverse kinematics solution corresponding to that COM respecting the joints constraints. In This paper the inertia weight PSO variant is used to generate a possible solution according to the stability based fitness function and a set of joints motions constraints. The method is applied with success to a leg motion generation. Since based on a pre-calculated COM, that satisfied the biped stability, the proposal allowed also to plan a walk with application on a small size biped robot.",0
"Decision circuits perform efficient evaluation of influence diagrams, building on the ad- vances in arithmetic circuits for belief net- work inference [Darwiche, 2003; Bhattachar- jya and Shachter, 2007]. We show how even more compact decision circuits can be con- structed for dynamic programming in influ- ence diagrams with separable value functions and conditionally independent subproblems. Once a decision circuit has been constructed based on the diagram's ""global"" graphical structure, it can be compiled to exploit ""lo- cal"" structure for efficient evaluation and sen- sitivity analysis.",0
"Markov decisions processes (MDPs) are becoming increasing popular as models of decision theoretic planning. While traditional dynamic programming methods perform well for problems with small state spaces, structured methods are needed for large problems. We propose and examine a value iteration algorithm for MDPs that uses algebraic decision diagrams(ADDs) to represent value functions and policies. An MDP is represented using Bayesian networks and ADDs and dynamic programming is applied directly to these ADDs. We demonstrate our method on large MDPs (up to 63 million states) and show that significant gains can be had when compared to tree-structured representations (with up to a thirty-fold reduction in the number of nodes required to represent optimal value functions).",0
"The optimization of functions to find the best solution according to one or several objectives has a central role in many engineering and research fields. Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios.",0
"In collective decision making, where a voting rule is used to take a collective decision among a group of agents, manipulation by one or more agents is usually considered negative behavior to be avoided, or at least to be made computationally difficult for the agents to perform. However, there are scenarios in which a restricted form of manipulation can instead be beneficial. In this paper we consider the iterative version of several voting rules, where at each step one agent is allowed to manipulate by modifying his ballot according to a set of restricted manipulation moves which are computationally easy and require little information to be performed. We prove convergence of iterative voting rules when restricted manipulation is allowed, and we present experiments showing that most iterative voting rules have a higher Condorcet efficiency than their non-iterative version.",0

"Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) are graphical representations of multi-component continuous-time Markov processes as directed graphs. The edges in the network represent direct influences among components. The joint rate matrix of the multi-component process is specified by means of conditional rate matrices for each component separately. This paper addresses the situation where some of the components evolve on a time scale that is much shorter compared to the time scale of the other components. In this paper, we prove that in the limit where the separation of scales is infinite, the Markov process converges (in distribution, or weakly) to a reduced, or effective Markov process that only involves the slow components. We also demonstrate that for reasonable separation of scale (an order of magnitude) the reduced process is a good approximation of the marginal process over the slow components. We provide a simple procedure for building a reduced CTBN for this effective process, with conditional rate matrices that can be directly calculated from the original CTBN, and discuss the implications for approximate reasoning in large systems.",0
"As a well-known clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) allows each input sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some decision-making application domains like network security and medical diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to catastrophic outcomes. They are mainly emerged from making decisions about a subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods. Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved sensitivity of the algorithm.",0
"Specialized dictionaries are used to understand concepts in specific domains, especially where those concepts are not part of the general vocabulary, or having meanings that differ from ordinary languages. The first step in creating a specialized dictionary involves detecting the characteristic vocabulary of the domain in question. Classical methods for detecting this vocabulary involve gathering a domain corpus, calculating statistics on the terms found there, and then comparing these statistics to a background or general language corpus. Terms which are found significantly more often in the specialized corpus than in the background corpus are candidates for the characteristic vocabulary of the domain. Here we present two tools, a directed crawler, and a distributional semantics package, that can be used together, circumventing the need of a background corpus. Both tools are available on the web.",0
"This paper presents a simple framework for Horn clause abduction, with probabilities associated with hypotheses. It is shown how this representation can represent any probabilistic knowledge representable in a Bayesian belief network. The main contributions are in finding a relationship between logical and probabilistic notions of evidential reasoning. This can be used as a basis for a new way to implement Bayesian Networks that allows for approximations to the value of the posterior probabilities, and also points to a way that Bayesian networks can be extended beyond a propositional language.",0
"The volume and velocity of information that gets generated online limits current journalistic practices to fact-check claims at the same rate. Computational approaches for fact checking may be the key to help mitigate the risks of massive misinformation spread. Such approaches can be designed to not only be scalable and effective at assessing veracity of dubious claims, but also to boost a human fact checker's productivity by surfacing relevant facts and patterns to aid their analysis. To this end, we present a novel, unsupervised network-flow based approach to determine the truthfulness of a statement of fact expressed in the form of a (subject, predicate, object) triple. We view a knowledge graph of background information about real-world entities as a flow network, and knowledge as a fluid, abstract commodity. We show that computational fact checking of such a triple then amounts to finding a ""knowledge stream"" that emanates from the subject node and flows toward the object node through paths connecting them. Evaluation on a range of real-world and hand-crafted datasets of facts related to entertainment, business, sports, geography and more reveals that this network-flow model can be very effective in discerning true statements from false ones, outperforming existing algorithms on many test cases. Moreover, the model is expressive in its ability to automatically discover several useful path patterns and surface relevant facts that may help a human fact checker corroborate or refute a claim.",0
"We consider decision-making and game scenarios in which an agent is limited by his/her computational ability to foresee all the available moves towards the future - that is, we study scenarios with short sight. We focus on how short sight affects the logical properties of decision making in multi-agent settings. We start with single-agent sequential decision making (SSDM) processes, modeling them by a new structure of ""preference-sight trees"". Using this model, we first explore the relation between a new natural solution concept of Sight-Compatible Backward Induction (SCBI) and the histories produced by classical Backward Induction (BI). In particular, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the two analyses to be equivalent. Next, we study whether larger sight always contributes to better outcomes. Then we develop a simple logical special-purpose language to formally express some key properties of our preference-sight models. Lastly, we show how short-sight SSDM scenarios call for substantial enrichments of existing fixed-point logics that have been developed for the classical BI solution concept. We also discuss changes in earlier modal logics expressing ""surface reasoning"" about best actions in the presence of short sight. Our analysis may point the way to logical and computational analysis of more realistic game models.",0
"It is well known that conditional independence can be used to factorize a joint probability into a multiplication of conditional probabilities. This paper proposes a constructive definition of inter-causal independence, which can be used to further factorize a conditional probability. An inference algorithm is developed, which makes use of both conditional independence and inter-causal independence to reduce inference complexity in Bayesian networks.",0
"The literature on judgment aggregation has now been moving from studying impossibility results regarding aggregation rules towards studying specific judgment aggregation rules. Here we focus on a family of rules that is the natural counterpart of the family of Condorcet-consistent voting rules: majority-preserving judgment aggregation rules. A judgment aggregation rule is majority-preserving if whenever issue-wise majority is consistent, the rule should output the majoritarian opinion on each issue. We provide a formal setting for relating judgment aggregation rules to voting rules and propose some basic properties for judgment aggregation rules. We consider six such rules some of which have already appeared in the literature, some others are new. For these rules we consider their relation to known voting rules, to each other, with respect to their discriminating power, and analyse them with respect to the considered properties.",0
"This Ontologies are widely used as a means for solving the information heterogeneity problems on the web because of their capability to provide explicit meaning to the information. They become an efficient tool for knowledge representation in a structured manner. There is always more than one ontology for the same domain. Furthermore, there is no standard method for building ontologies, and there are many ontology building tools using different ontology languages. Because of these reasons, interoperability between the ontologies is very low. Current ontology tools mostly use functions to build, edit and inference the ontology. Methods for merging heterogeneous domain ontologies are not included in most tools. This paper presents ontology merging methodology for building a single global ontology from heterogeneous eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data sources to capture and maintain all the knowledge which XML data sources can contain",0
"Our world is filled with both beautiful and brainy people, but how often does a Nobel Prize winner also wins a beauty pageant? Let us assume that someone who is both very beautiful and very smart is more rare than what we would expect from the combination of the number of beautiful and brainy people. Of course there will still always be some individuals that defy this stereotype; these beautiful brainy people are exactly the class of anomaly we focus on in this paper. They do not posses rare qualities, but it is the unexpected combination of factors that makes them stand out.",0
"The phenomenal growth in the healthcare data has inspired us in investigating robust and scalable models for data mining. For classification problems Information Gain(IG) based Decision Tree is one of the popular choices. However, depending upon the nature of the dataset, IG based Decision Tree may not always perform well as it prefers the attribute with more number of distinct values as the splitting attribute. Healthcare datasets generally have many attributes and each attribute generally has many distinct values. In this paper, we have tried to focus on this characteristics of the datasets while analysing the performance of our proposed approach which is a variant of Decision Tree model and uses the concept of Correlation Ratio(CR). Unlike IG based approach, this CR based approach has no biasness towards the attribute with more number of distinct values. We have applied our model on some benchmark healthcare datasets to show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",0
"In this work we present Cutting Plane Inference (CPI), a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference method for Statistical Relational Learning. Framed in terms of Markov Logic and inspired by the Cutting Plane Method, it can be seen as a meta algorithm that instantiates small parts of a large and complex Markov Network and then solves these using a conventional MAP method. We evaluate CPI on two tasks, Semantic Role Labelling and Joint Entity Resolution, while plugging in two different MAP inference methods: the current method of choice for MAP inference in Markov Logic, MaxWalkSAT, and Integer Linear Programming. We observe that when used with CPI both methods are significantly faster than when used alone. In addition, CPI improves the accuracy of MaxWalkSAT and maintains the exactness of Integer Linear Programming.",0
In this work we extend to the interval-valued setting the notion of an overlap functions and we discuss a method which makes use of interval-valued overlap functions for constructing OWA operators with interval-valued weights. . Some properties of interval-valued overlap functions and the derived interval-valued OWA operators are analysed. We specially focus on the homogeneity and migrativity properties.,0
"Advances in processing capacity, coupled with the desire to tackle problems where a human subjective judgment plays an important role in determining the value of a proposed solution, has led to a dramatic rise in the number of applications of Interactive Artificial Intelligence. Of particular note is the coupling of meta-heuristic search engines with user-provided evaluation and rating of solutions, usually in the form of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs). These have a well-documented history of successes, but arguably the preponderance of IEAs stems from this history, rather than as a conscious design choice of meta-heuristic based on the characteristics of the problem at hand. This paper sets out to examine the basis for that assumption, taking as a case study the domain of interactive software design. We consider a range of factors that should affect the design choice including ease of use, scalability, and of course, performance, i.e. that ability to generate good solutions within the limited number of evaluations available in interactive work before humans lose focus. We then evaluate three methods, namely greedy local search, an evolutionary algorithm and ant colony optimization, with a variety of representations for candidate solutions. Results show that after suitable parameter tuning, ant colony optimization is highly effective within interactive search and out-performs evolutionary algorithms with respect to increasing numbers of attributes and methods in the software design problem. However, when larger numbers of classes are present in the software design, an evolutionary algorithm using a naive grouping integer-based representation appears more scalable.",0
"Representation learning of knowledge graphs encodes entities and relation types into a continuous low-dimensional vector space, learns embeddings of entities and relation types. Most existing methods only concentrate on knowledge triples, ignoring logic rules which contain rich background knowledge. Although there has been some work aiming at leveraging both knowledge triples and logic rules, they ignore the transitivity and antisymmetry of logic rules. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn knowledge representations with entities and ordered relations in knowledges and logic rules. The key idea is to integrate knowledge triples and logic rules, and approximately order the relation types in logic rules to utilize the transitivity and antisymmetry of logic rules. All entries of the embeddings of relation types are constrained to be non-negative. We translate the general constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem to solve the non-negative matrix factorization. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms other baselines on knowledge graph completion task. It indicates that our model is capable of capturing the transitivity and antisymmetry information, which is significant when learning embeddings of knowledge graphs.",0
"We present a scalable parallel solver for numerical constraint satisfaction problems (NCSPs). Our parallelization scheme consists of homogeneous worker solvers, each of which runs on an available core and communicates with others via the global load balancing (GLB) method.

In experiments, several NCSPs from the literature were solved and attained up to 516-fold speedup using 600 cores of the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer.",0
"We present our ongoing work and initial results towards the (behavioral) correctness analysis of the cognitive middleware AWDRAT. Since, the (provable) behavioral correctness of a software system is a fundamental pre-requisite of the system's security. Therefore, the goal of the work is to first formalize the behavioral semantics of the middleware as a pre-requisite for our proof of the behavioral correctness. However, in this paper, we focus only on the core and critical component of the middleware, i.e. Execution Monitor which is a part of the module ""Architectural Differencer"" of AWDRAT. The role of the execution monitor is to identify inconsistencies between runtime observations of the target system and predictions of the specification System Architectural Model of the system. As a starting point we have defined the formal (denotational) semantics of the observations (runtime events) and predictions (executable specifications as of System Architectural Model); then based on the aforementioned formal semantices, we have formalized the behavior of the ""Execution Monitor"" of the middleware.",0
"As part of Smart Cities initiatives, national, regional and local governments all over the globe are under the mandate of being more open regarding how they share their data. Under this mandate, many of these governments are publishing data under the umbrella of open government data, which includes measurement data from city-wide sensor networks. Furthermore, many of these data are published in so-called data portals as documents that may be spreadsheets, comma-separated value (CSV) data files, or plain documents in PDF or Word documents. The sharing of these documents may be a convenient way for the data provider to convey and publish data but it is not the ideal way for data consumers to reuse the data. For example, the problems of reusing the data may range from difficulty opening a document that is provided in any format that is not plain text, to the actual problem of understanding the meaning of each piece of knowledge inside of the document. Our proposal tackles those challenges by identifying metadata that has been regarded to be relevant for measurement data and providing a schema for this metadata. We further leverage the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO) to build an architecture for data collected in urban environments. We discuss the use of HASNetO and the supporting infrastructure to manage both data and metadata in support of the City of Fortaleza, a large metropolitan area in Brazil.",0
"It is not rare that the performance of one metaheuristic algorithm can be improved by incorporating ideas taken from another. In this article we present how Simulated Annealing (SA) can be used to improve the efficiency of the Ant Colony System (ACS) and Enhanced ACS when solving the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP). Moreover, we show how the very same ideas can be applied to improve the convergence of a dedicated local search, i.e. the SOP-3-exchange algorithm. A statistical analysis of the proposed algorithms both in terms of finding suitable parameter values and the quality of the generated solutions is presented based on a series of computational experiments conducted on SOP instances from the well-known TSPLIB and SOPLIB2006 repositories. The proposed ACS-SA and EACS-SA algorithms often generate solutions of better quality than the ACS and EACS, respectively. Moreover, the EACS-SA algorithm combined with the proposed SOP-3-exchange-SA local search was able to find 10 new best solutions for the SOP instances from the SOPLIB2006 repository, thus improving the state-of-the-art results as known from the literature. Overall, the best known or improved solutions were found in 41 out of 48 cases.",0
"Recognizing arbitrary objects in the wild has been a challenging problem due to the limitations of existing classification models and datasets. In this paper, we propose a new task that aims at parsing scene with a large and open vocabulary, and several evaluation metrics are explored for this problem. Our proposed approach to this problem is a joint image pixel and word concept embeddings framework, where word concepts are connected by semantic relations. We validate the open vocabulary prediction ability of our framework on ADE20K dataset which covers a wide variety of scenes and objects. We further explore the trained joint embedding space to show its interpretability.",0
"We present a method for inducing new dialogue systems from very small amounts of unannotated dialogue data, showing how word-level exploration using Reinforcement Learning (RL), combined with an incremental and semantic grammar - Dynamic Syntax (DS) - allows systems to discover, generate, and understand many new dialogue variants. The method avoids the use of expensive and time-consuming dialogue act annotations, and supports more natural (incremental) dialogues than turn-based systems. Here, language generation and dialogue management are treated as a joint decision/optimisation problem, and the MDP model for RL is constructed automatically. With an implemented system, we show that this method enables a wide range of dialogue variations to be automatically captured, even when the system is trained from only a single dialogue. The variants include question-answer pairs, over- and under-answering, self- and other-corrections, clarification interaction, split-utterances, and ellipsis. This generalisation property results from the structural knowledge and constraints present within the DS grammar, and highlights some limitations of recent systems built using machine learning techniques only.",0
"Inverse optimal control, also known as inverse reinforcement learning, is the problem of recovering an unknown reward function in a Markov decision process from expert demonstrations of the optimal policy. We introduce a probabilistic inverse optimal control algorithm that scales gracefully with task dimensionality, and is suitable for large, continuous domains where even computing a full policy is impractical. By using a local approximation of the reward function, our method can also drop the assumption that the demonstrations are globally optimal, requiring only local optimality. This allows it to learn from examples that are unsuitable for prior methods.",1
"We re-examine a practical aspect of combinatorial fuzzy problems of various types, including search, counting, optimization, and decision problems. We are focused only on those fuzzy problems that take series of fuzzy input objects and produce fuzzy values. To solve such problems efficiently, we design fast fuzzy algorithms, which are modeled by polynomial-time deterministic fuzzy Turing machines equipped with read-only auxiliary tapes and write-only output tapes and also modeled by polynomial-size fuzzy circuits composed of fuzzy gates. We also introduce fuzzy proof verification systems to model the fuzzification of nondeterminism. Those models help us identify four complexity classes: Fuzzy-FPA of fuzzy functions, Fuzzy-PA and Fuzzy-NPA of fuzzy decision problems, and Fuzzy-NPAO of fuzzy optimization problems. Based on a relative approximation scheme targeting fuzzy membership degree, we formulate two notions of ""reducibility"" in order to compare the computational complexity of two fuzzy problems. These reducibility notions make it possible to locate the most difficult fuzzy problems in Fuzzy-NPA and in Fuzzy-NPAO.",0
"This paper presents a concept of a novel method for adjusting hyper-parameters in Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. An external agent-observer monitors a performance of a selected Deep Learning algorithm. The observer learns to model the DL algorithm using a series of random experiments. Consequently, it may be used for predicting a response of the DL algorithm in terms of a selected quality measurement to a set of hyper-parameters. This allows to construct an ensemble composed of a series of evaluators which constitute an observer-assisted architecture. The architecture may be used to gradually iterate towards to the best achievable quality score in tiny steps governed by a unit of progress. The algorithm is stopped when the maximum number of steps is reached or no further progress is made.",0
"Accurately predicting the time of occurrence of an event of interest is a critical problem in longitudinal data analysis. One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. Such a phenomenon is called censoring which can be effectively handled using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome this censoring issue. In addition, many machine learning algorithms are adapted to effectively handle survival data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the representative statistical methods along with the machine learning techniques used in survival analysis and provide a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and illustrate several successful applications in various real-world application domains. We hope that this paper will provide a more thorough understanding of the recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines on applying these approaches to solve new problems that arise in applications with censored data.",0
"Many NLP tasks including machine comprehension, answer selection and text entailment require the comparison between sequences. Matching the important units between sequences is a key to solve these problems. In this paper, we present a general ""compare-aggregate"" framework that performs word-level matching followed by aggregation using Convolutional Neural Networks. We particularly focus on the different comparison functions we can use to match two vectors. We use four different datasets to evaluate the model. We find that some simple comparison functions based on element-wise operations can work better than standard neural network and neural tensor network.",1
"One of the most challenging problems in recommender systems based on the collaborative filtering (CF) concept is data sparseness, i.e., limited user preference data is available for making recommendations. Cross-domain collaborative filtering (CDCF) has been studied as an effective mechanism to alleviate data sparseness of one domain by transferring knowledge about user preferences from other domains. However, there are two key issues that need to be addressed to make a CDCF approach successful: (a) what common characteristics can be used to establish a link between different domains and (b) how to get each domain effectively and efficiently benefit from such a link. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Generalized Tag-induced Cross-domain Collaborative Filtering (GTagCDCF), that exploits user-contributed tags as common characteristics to link different domains together. Formulated from the probabilistic point of view, GTagCDCF takes into account all the user-item relations, the user-tag relations and the item-tag relations from different domains, in which the common tags take the role of effectively transferring the knowledge between different domains. Using publicly available datasets to represent three cross-domain cases, we experimentally demonstrate that GTagCDCF substantially outperforms several state-of-the-art single domain and cross-domain CF-based recommendation approaches. GTagCDCF is also shown to be effective for heterogeneous cross-domain cases, in which different domains are characterized by different types of user preferences. In addition, our investigation of the impact of user tagging behavior on GTagCDCF led to the conclusion that users can already benefit from GTagCDCF if they only share a few common tags. Finally, we validate the robustness of GTagCDCF with respect to the scale of datasets and the number of domains, based on a three-domain experiment.",0
"A model to represent spatial information is presented in this paper. It is based on fuzzy constraints represented as fuzzy geometric relations that can be hierarchically structured. The concept of spatial template is introduced to capture the idea of interrelated objects in two-dimensional space. The representation model is used to specify imprecise or vague information consisting in relative locations and orientations of template objects. It is shown in this paper how a template represented by this model can be matched against a crisp situation to recognize a particular instance of this template. Furthermore, the proximity measure (fuzzy measure) between the instance and the template is worked out - this measure can be interpreted as a degree of similarity. In this context, template recognition can be viewed as a case of fuzzy pattern recognition. The results of this work have been implemented and applied to a complex military problem from which this work originated.",0
"The Isabelle/PIDE platform addresses the question whether proof assistants of the LCF family are suitable as technological basis for educational tools. The traditionally strong logical foundations of systems like HOL, Coq, or Isabelle have so far been counter-balanced by somewhat inaccessible interaction via the TTY (or minor variations like the well-known Proof General / Emacs interface). Thus the fundamental question of math education tools with fully-formal background theories has often been answered negatively due to accidental weaknesses of existing proof engines.",0
"We propose a scalable approach to learn video-based question answering (QA): answer a ""free-form natural language question"" about a video content. Our approach automatically harvests a large number of videos and descriptions freely available online. Then, a large number of candidate QA pairs are automatically generated from descriptions rather than manually annotated. Next, we use these candidate QA pairs to train a number of video-based QA methods extended fromMN (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015), VQA (Antol et al. 2015), SA (Yao et al. 2015), SS (Venugopalan et al. 2015). In order to handle non-perfect candidate QA pairs, we propose a self-paced learning procedure to iteratively identify them and mitigate their effects in training. Finally, we evaluate performance on manually generated video-based QA pairs. The results show that our self-paced learning procedure is effective, and the extended SS model outperforms various baselines.",1
"ROSS (""Representation, Ontology, Structure, Star"") is introduced as a new method for knowledge representation that emphasizes representational constructs for physical structure.

Instance models are used in the area of natural language meaning representation to represent situations. This paper provides both the rationale and the philosophical background for the ROSS method.",0
"Every directed acyclic graph (DAG) over a finite non-empty set of variables (= nodes) N induces an independence model over N, which is a list of conditional independence statements over N.The inclusion problem is how to characterize (in graphical terms) whether all independence statements in the model induced by a DAG K are in the model induced by a second DAG L. Meek (1997) conjectured that this inclusion holds iff there exists a sequence of DAGs from L to K such that only certain 'legal' arrow reversal and 'legal' arrow adding operations are performed to get the next DAG in the sequence.In this paper we give several characterizations of inclusion of DAG models and verify Meek's conjecture in the case that the DAGs K and L differ in at most one adjacency. As a warming up a rigorous proof of well-known graphical characterizations of equivalence of DAGs, which is a highly related problem, is given.",0

"Vehicle climate control systems aim to keep passengers thermally comfortable. However, current systems control temperature rather than thermal comfort and tend to be energy hungry, which is of particular concern when considering electric vehicles. This paper poses energy-efficient vehicle comfort control as a Markov Decision Process, which is then solved numerically using Sarsa({\lambda}) and an empirically validated, single-zone, 1D thermal model of the cabin. The resulting controller was tested in simulation using 200 randomly selected scenarios and found to exceed the performance of bang-bang, proportional, simple fuzzy logic, and commercial controllers with 23%, 43%, 40%, 56% increase, respectively. Compared to the next best performing controller, energy consumption is reduced by 13% while the proportion of time spent thermally comfortable is increased by 23%. These results indicate that this is a viable approach that promises to translate into substantial comfort and energy improvements in the car.",0
"In this paper we propose a data intensive approach for inferring sentence-internal temporal relations. Temporal inference is relevant for practical NLP applications which either extract or synthesize temporal information (e.g., summarisation, question answering). Our method bypasses the need for manual coding by exploiting the presence of markers like after"", which overtly signal a temporal relation. We first show that models trained on main and subordinate clauses connected with a temporal marker achieve good performance on a pseudo-disambiguation task simulating temporal inference (during testing the temporal marker is treated as unseen and the models must select the right marker from a set of possible candidates). Secondly, we assess whether the proposed approach holds promise for the semi-automatic creation of temporal annotations. Specifically, we use a model trained on noisy and approximate data (i.e., main and subordinate clauses) to predict intra-sentential relations present in TimeBank, a corpus annotated rich temporal information. Our experiments compare and contrast several probabilistic models differing in their feature space, linguistic assumptions and data requirements. We evaluate performance against gold standard corpora and also against human subjects.",1
"The goal of continuous emotion recognition is to assign an emotion value to every frame in a sequence of acoustic features. We show that incorporating long-term temporal dependencies is critical for continuous emotion recognition tasks. To this end, we first investigate architectures that use dilated convolutions. We show that even though such architectures outperform previously reported systems, the output signals produced from such architectures undergo erratic changes between consecutive time steps. This is inconsistent with the slow moving ground-truth emotion labels that are obtained from human annotators. To deal with this problem, we model a downsampled version of the input signal and then generate the output signal through upsampling. Not only does the resulting downsampling/upsampling network achieve good performance, it also generates smooth output trajectories. Our method yields the best known audio-only performance on the RECOLA dataset.",0
"In this paper, we address the problem of how automated situation-awareness can be achieved by learning real-world situations from ubiquitously generated mobility data. Without semantic input about the time and space where situations take place, this turns out to be a fundamental challenging problem. Uncertainties also introduce technical challenges when data is generated in irregular time intervals, being mixed with noise, and errors. Purely relying on temporal patterns observable in mobility data, in this paper, we propose Spaceprint, a fully automated algorithm for finding the repetitive pattern of similar situations in spaces. We evaluate this technique by showing how the latent variables describing the category, and the actual identity of a space can be discovered from the extracted situation patterns. Doing so, we use different real-world mobility datasets with data about the presence of mobile entities in a variety of spaces. We also evaluate the performance of this technique by showing its robustness against uncertainties.",0
"Drawing from research on computational models of argumentation (particularly the Carneades Argumentation System), we explore the graphical representation of arguments in a dispute; then, comparing two different traditions on the limits of the justification of decisions, and devising an intermediate, semi-formal, model, we also show that it can shed light on the theory of dispute resolution.",0
"Precision-recall (PR) curves and the areas under them are widely used to summarize machine learning results, especially for data sets exhibiting class skew. They are often used analogously to ROC curves and the area under ROC curves. It is known that PR curves vary as class skew changes. What was not recognized before this paper is that there is a region of PR space that is completely unachievable, and the size of this region depends only on the skew. This paper precisely characterizes the size of that region and discusses its implications for empirical evaluation methodology in machine learning.",1
"We develop a belief space planning (BSP) approach that advances the state of the art by incorporating reasoning about data association (DA) within planning, while considering additional sources of uncertainty. Existing BSP approaches typically assume data association is given and perfect, an assumption that can be harder to justify while operating, in the presence of localization uncertainty, in ambiguous and perceptually aliased environments. In contrast, our data association aware belief space planning (DA-BSP) approach explicitly reasons about DA within belief evolution, and as such can better accommodate these challenging real world scenarios. In particular, we show that due to perceptual aliasing, the posterior belief becomes a mixture of probability distribution functions, and design cost functions that measure the expected level of ambiguity and posterior uncertainty. Using these and standard costs (e.g.~control penalty, distance to goal) within the objective function, yields a general framework that reliably represents action impact, and in particular, capable of active disambiguation. Our approach is thus applicable to robust active perception and autonomous navigation in perceptually aliased environments. We demonstrate key aspects in basic and realistic simulations.",0
"Communication and interaction among agents have been the subject of extensive investigation since many years. Commitment-based communication, where communicating agents are seen as a debtor agent who is committed to a creditor agent to bring about something (possibly under some conditions) is now very well-established. The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitment-based MAS) lifts commitment-related approaches proposed in the literature from a propositional to a first-order setting via the adoption the DRL-Lite Description Logic. Notably, DACMASs provide, beyond commitments, simple forms of inter-agent event-based communication. Yet, the aspect is missing of making a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which are external to the MAS. This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed Multi-Context Systems), where however exchanges are among knowledge bases and not agents. In this paper, we propose the new approach of DACmMCMASs (Data-Aware Commitment-based managed Multi- Context MAS), so as to obtain a commitment-based first-order agent system which is able to interact with heterogeneous external information sources. We show that DACmMCMASs retain the nice formal properties of the original approaches.",0
"With the advent of modern computer networks, fault diagnosis has been a focus of research activity. This paper reviews the history of fault diagnosis in networks and discusses the main methods in information gathering section, information analyzing section and diagnosing and revolving section of fault diagnosis in networks. Emphasis will be placed upon knowledge-based methods with discussing the advantages and shortcomings of the different methods. The survey is concluded with a description of some open problems.",0
"Suppose we are given the conditional probability of one variable given some other variables.Normally the full joint distribution over the conditioning variablesis required to determine the probability of the conditioned variable.Under what circumstances are the marginal distributions over the conditioning variables sufficient to determine the probability ofthe conditioned variable?Sufficiency in this sense is equivalent to additive separability ofthe conditional probability distribution.Such separability structure is natural and can be exploited forefficient inference.Separability has a natural generalization to conditional separability.Separability provides a precise notion of weaklyinteracting subsystems in temporal probabilistic models.Given a system that is decomposed into separable subsystems, exactmarginal probabilities over subsystems at future points in time can becomputed by propagating marginal subsystem probabilities, rather thancomplete system joint probabilities.Thus, separability can make exact prediction tractable.However, observations can break separability,so exact monitoring of dynamic systems remains hard.",0
I consider the problem of learning an optimal path graphical model from data and show the problem to be NP-hard for the maximum likelihood and minimum description length approaches and a Bayesian approach. This hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the optimal tree graphical model.,0
"This paper studies single-image depth perception in the wild, i.e., recovering depth from a single image taken in unconstrained settings. We introduce a new dataset ""Depth in the Wild"" consisting of images in the wild annotated with relative depth between pairs of random points. We also propose a new algorithm that learns to estimate metric depth using annotations of relative depth. Compared to the state of the art, our algorithm is simpler and performs better. Experiments show that our algorithm, combined with existing RGB-D data and our new relative depth annotations, significantly improves single-image depth perception in the wild.",1
"Linear-time computational techniques have been developed for combining evidence which is available on a number of contending hypotheses. They offer a means of making the computation-intensive calculations involved more efficient in certain circumstances. Unfortunately, they restrict the orthogonal sum of evidential functions to the dichotomous structure applies only to elements and their complements. In this paper, we present a novel evidence structure in terms of a triplet and a set of algorithms for evidential reasoning. The merit of this structure is that it divides a set of evidence into three subsets, distinguishing trivial evidential elements from important ones focusing some particular elements. It avoids the deficits of the dichotomous structure in representing the preference of evidence and estimating the basic probability assignment of evidence. We have established a formalism for this structure and the general formulae for combining pieces of evidence in the form of the triplet, which have been theoretically justified.",0
Selecting the right reference class and the right interval when faced with conflicting candidates and no possibility of establishing subset style dominance has been a problem for Kyburg's Evidential Probability system. Various methods have been proposed by Loui and Kyburg to solve this problem in a way that is both intuitively appealing and justifiable within Kyburg's framework. The scheme proposed in this paper leads to stronger statistical assertions without sacrificing too much of the intuitive appeal of Kyburg's latest proposal.,0
"An important problem in the field of bioinformatics is to identify interactive effects among profiled variables for outcome prediction. In this paper, a simple logistic regression model with pairwise interactions among a set of binary covariates is considered. Modeling the structure of the interactions by a graph, our goal is to recover the interaction graph from independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of the covariates and the outcome.",0
"Knowledge representation and reasoning capacities are vital to cognitive robotics because they provide higher level cognitive functions for reasoning about actions, environments, goals, perception, etc. Although Answer Set Programming (ASP) is well suited for modelling such functions, there was so far no seamless way to use ASP in a robotic environment. We address this shortcoming and show how a recently developed reactive ASP system can be harnessed to provide appropriate reasoning capacities within a robotic system. To be more precise, we furnish a package integrating the reactive ASP solver oClingo with the popular open-source robotic middleware ROS. The resulting system, ROSoClingo, provides a generic way by which an ASP program can be used to control the behaviour of a robot and to respond to the results of the robot's actions.",0
"Acyclic directed mixed graphs, also known as semi-Markov models represent the conditional independence structure induced on an observed margin by a DAG model with latent variables. In this paper we present a factorization criterion for these models that is equivalent to the global Markov property given by (the natural extension of) d-separation.",0
"The causal graph of a planning instance is an important tool for planning both in practice and in theory. The theoretical studies of causal graphs have largely analysed the computational complexity of planning for instances where the causal graph has a certain structure, often in combination with other parameters like the domain size of the variables. Chen and Gimand#233;nez ignored even the structure and considered only the size of the weakly connected components. They proved that planning is tractable if the components are bounded by a constant and otherwise intractable. Their intractability result was, however, conditioned by an assumption from parameterised complexity theory that has no known useful relationship with the standard complexity classes. We approach the same problem from the perspective of standard complexity classes, and prove that planning is NP-hard for classes with unbounded components under an additional restriction we refer to as SP-closed. We then argue that most NP-hardness theorems for causal graphs are difficult to apply and, thus, prove a more general result; even if the component sizes grow slowly and the class is not densely populated with graphs, planning still cannot be tractable unless the polynomial hierachy collapses. Both these results still hold when restricted to the class of acyclic causal graphs. We finally give a partial characterization of the borderline between NP-hard and NP-intermediate classes, giving further insight into the problem.",0
"Important advances have been made in the fuzzy quantification field. Nevertheless, some problems remain when we face the decision of selecting the most convenient model for a specific application. In the literature, several desirable adequacy properties have been proposed, but theoretical limits impede quantification models from simultaneously fulfilling every adequacy property that has been defined. Besides, the complexity of model definitions and adequacy properties makes very difficult for real users to understand the particularities of the different models that have been presented. In this work we will present several criteria conceived to help in the process of selecting the most adequate Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanisms for specific practical applications. In addition, some of the best known well-behaved models will be compared against this list of criteria. Based on this analysis, some guidance to choose fuzzy quantification models for practical applications will be provided.",0
"This note introduce three Bayesian style Multi-armed bandit algorithms: Information-directed sampling, Thompson Sampling and Generalized Thompson Sampling. The goal is to give an intuitive explanation for these three algorithms and their regret bounds, and provide some derivations that are omitted in the original papers.",0
"We propose a novel deep network architecture for grayscale and color image denoising that is based on a non-local image model. Our motivation for the overall design of the proposed network stems from variational methods that exploit the inherent non-local self-similarity property of natural images. We build on this concept and introduce deep networks that perform non-local processing and at the same time they significantly benefit from discriminative learning. Experiments on the Berkeley segmentation dataset, comparing several state-of-the-art methods, show that the proposed non-local models achieve the best reported denoising performance both for grayscale and color images for all the tested noise levels. It is also worth noting that this increase in performance comes at no extra cost on the capacity of the network compared to existing alternative deep network architectures. In addition, we highlight a direct link of the proposed non-local models to convolutional neural networks. This connection is of significant importance since it allows our models to take full advantage of the latest advances on GPU computing in deep learning and makes them amenable to efficient implementations through their inherent parallelism.",0
"The sampling based motion planning algorithm known as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) has gained the attention of many researchers due to their computational efficiency and effectiveness. Recently, a variant of RRT called RRT* has been proposed that ensures asymptotic optimality. Subsequently its bidirectional version has also been introduced in the literature known as Bidirectional-RRT* (B-RRT*). We introduce a new variant called Intelligent Bidirectional-RRT* (IB-RRT*) which is an improved variant of the optimal RRT* and bidirectional version of RRT* (B-RRT*) algorithms and is specially designed for complex cluttered environments. IB-RRT* utilizes the bidirectional trees approach and introduces intelligent sample insertion heuristic for fast convergence to the optimal path solution using uniform sampling heuristics. The proposed algorithm is evaluated theoretically and experimental results are presented that compares IB-RRT* with RRT* and B-RRT*. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate the superior efficiency of IB-RRT* in comparison with RRT* and B-RRT in complex cluttered environments.",0
"The developpment of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept revives Responsive Environments (RE) technologies. Nowadays, the idea of a permanent connection between physical and digital world is technologically possible. The capillar Internet relates to the Internet extension into daily appliances such as they become actors of Internet like any hu-man. The parallel development of Machine-to-Machine communications and Arti cial Intelligence (AI) technics start a new area of cybernetic. This paper presents an approach for Cybernetic Organism (Cyborg) for RE based on Organic Computing (OC). In such approach, each appli-ance is a part of an autonomic system in order to control a physical environment. The underlying idea is that such systems must have self-x properties in order to adapt their behavior to external disturbances with a high-degree of autonomy.",0
"Causality has been recently introduced in databases, to model, characterize and possibly compute causes for query results (answers). Connections between queryanswer causality, consistency-based diagnosis, database repairs (wrt. integrity constraint violations), abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem have been established. In this work we further investigate connections between query-answer causality and abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem. In this context, we also define and investigate the notion of query-answer causality in the presence of integrity constraints.",0
"In order to obtain reliable accuracy estimates for automatic MOOC dropout predictors, it is important to train and test them in a manner consistent with how they will be used in practice. Yet most prior research on MOOC dropout prediction has measured test accuracy on the same course used for training the classifier, which can lead to overly optimistic accuracy estimates. In order to understand better how accuracy is affected by the training+testing regime, we compared the accuracy of a standard dropout prediction architecture (clickstream features + logistic regression) across 4 different training paradigms. Results suggest that (1) training and testing on the same course (""post-hoc"") can overestimate accuracy by several percentage points; (2) dropout classifiers trained on proxy labels based on students' persistence are surprisingly competitive with post-hoc training (87.33% versus 90.20% AUC averaged over 8 weeks of 40 HarvardX MOOCs); and (3) classifier performance does not vary significantly with the academic discipline. Finally, we also research new dropout prediction architectures based on deep, fully-connected, feed-forward neural networks and find that (4) networks with as many as 5 hidden layers can statistically significantly increase test accuracy over that of logistic regression.",0
"Analyses of text corpora over time can reveal trends in beliefs, interest, and sentiment about a topic. We focus on views expressed about artificial intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over a 30-year period. General interest, awareness, and discussion about AI has waxed and waned since the field was founded in 1956. We present a set of measures that captures levels of engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over decades. We find that discussion of AI has increased sharply since 2009, and that these discussions have been consistently more optimistic than pessimistic. However, when we examine specific concerns, we find that worries of loss of control of AI, ethical concerns for AI, and the negative impact of AI on work have grown in recent years. We also find that hopes for AI in healthcare and education have also increased over time.",1
"An algorithm for pose and motion estimation using corresponding features in omnidirectional images and a digital terrain map is proposed. In previous paper, such algorithm for regular camera was considered. Using a Digital Terrain (or Digital Elevation) Map (DTM/DEM) as a global reference enables recovering the absolute position and orientation of the camera. In order to do this, the DTM is used to formulate a constraint between corresponding features in two consecutive frames. In this paper, these constraints are extended to handle non-central projection, as is the case with many omnidirectional systems. The utilization of omnidirectional data is shown to improve the robustness and accuracy of the navigation algorithm. The feasibility of this algorithm is established through lab experimentation with two kinds of omnidirectional acquisition systems. The first one is polydioptric cameras while the second is catadioptric camera.",0
"Despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork, existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions nor the complexity of the teamwork problem. Without a characterization of the optimality-complexity tradeoffs, it is impossible to determine whether the assumptions and approximations made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for use by multiagent researchers in evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP). The COM-MTDP model combines and extends existing multiagent theories, such as decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes and economic team theory. In addition to their generality of representation, COM-MTDPs also support the analysis of both the optimality of team performance and the computational complexity of the agents' decision problem. In analyzing complexity, we present a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under various classes of problem domains, along the dimensions of observability and communication cost. In analyzing optimality, we exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint intentions theory taken from the literature. Furthermore, the COM-MTDP model provides a basis for the development of novel team coordination algorithms. We derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations with respect to this optimal policy. We have implemented a reusable, domain-independent software package based on COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork coordination strategies, and we demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint intentions strategies within an example domain.",0
"In recent years, portfolio approaches to solving SAT problems and CSPs have become increasingly common. There are also a number of different techniques for converting SAT problems into CSPs. In this paper, we leverage advances in both areas and present a novel hierarchical portfolio-based approach to CSP solving that does not rely purely on CSP solvers, but may convert a problem to SAT choosing a conversion technique and the accommodating SAT solver. Our experimental evaluation relies on competition CSP instances and uses eight CSP solvers, three SAT encodings and eighteen SAT solvers. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements can be obtained by considering alternative view-points of a combinatorial problem.",0
"Decision making is often based on Bayesian networks. The building blocks for Bayesian networks are its conditional probability tables (CPTs). These tables are obtained by parameter estimation methods, or they are elicited from subject matter experts (SME). Some of these knowledge representations are insufficient approximations. Using knowledge fusion of cause and effect observations lead to better predictive decisions. We propose three new methods to generate CPTs, which even work when only soft evidence is provided. The first two are novel ways of mapping conditional expectations to the probability space. The third is a column extraction method, which obtains CPTs from nonlinear functions such as the multinomial logistic regression. Case studies on military effects and burnt forest desertification have demonstrated that so derived CPTs have highly reliable predictive power, including superiority over the CPTs obtained from SMEs. In this context, new quality measures for determining the goodness of a CPT and for comparing CPTs with each other have been introduced. The predictive power and enhanced reliability of decision making based on the novel CPT generation methods presented in this paper have been confirmed and validated within the context of the case studies.",0
"There are already quite a few tools for solving the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems. In this paper, we present \texttt{VolCE}, a tool for counting the solutions of SMT constraints, or in other words, for computing the volume of the solution space. Its input is essentially a set of Boolean combinations of linear constraints, where the numeric variables are either all integers or all reals, and each variable is bounded. The tool extends SMT solving with integer solution counting and volume computation/estimation for convex polytopes. Effective heuristics are adopted, which enable the tool to deal with high-dimensional problem instances efficiently and accurately.",0
"We consider a framework for structured prediction based on search in the space of complete structured outputs. Given a structured input, an output is produced by running a time-bounded search procedure guided by a learned cost function, and then returning the least cost output uncovered during the search. This framework can be instantiated for a wide range of search spaces and search procedures, and easily incorporates arbitrary structured-prediction loss functions. In this paper, we make two main technical contributions. First, we define the limited-discrepancy search space over structured outputs, which is able to leverage powerful classification learning algorithms to improve the search space quality. Second, we give a generic cost function learning approach, where the key idea is to learn a cost function that attempts to mimic the behavior of conducting searches guided by the true loss function. Our experiments on six benchmark domains demonstrate that using our framework with only a small amount of search is sufficient for significantly improving on state-of-the-art structured-prediction performance.",1
"Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive architecture and the perception-action model (PAM), we propose that the internal status acts as a kind of common-coding representation which affects, mediates and even regulates the sensorimotor behaviours. These regulation can be depicted in the Bayesian framework, that is why cognitive agents are able to generate behaviours with subtle differences according to their emotion or recognize the emotion by perception. A novel recurrent neural network called recurrent neural network with parametric bias units (RNNPB) runs in three modes, constructing a two-level emotion regulated learning model, was further applied to testify this theory in two different cases.",0
"We present a suite of algorithms for Dimension Independent Similarity Computation (DISCO) to compute all pairwise similarities between very high dimensional sparse vectors. All of our results are provably independent of dimension, meaning apart from the initial cost of trivially reading in the data, all subsequent operations are independent of the dimension, thus the dimension can be very large. We study Cosine, Dice, Overlap, Conditional, and the Jaccard similarity measures. For Jaccard similiarity we include an improved version of MinHash. Our results are geared toward the MapReduce framework. We empirically validate our theorems at large scale using data from the social networking site Twitter.",0
"IT infrastructure is a crucial part in most of today's business operations. High availability and reliability, and short response times to outages are essential. Thus a high amount of tool support and automation in risk management is desirable to decrease outages. We propose a new approach for calculating the root cause for an observed failure in an IT infrastructure. Our approach is based on Abduction in Markov Logic Networks. Abduction aims to find an explanation for a given observation in the light of some background knowledge. In failure diagnosis, the explanation corresponds to the root cause, the observation to the failure of a component, and the background knowledge to the dependency graph extended by potential risks. We apply a method to extend a Markov Logic Network in order to conduct abductive reasoning, which is not naturally supported in this formalism. Our approach exhibits a high amount of reusability and enables users without specific knowledge of a concrete infrastructure to gain viable insights in the case of an incident. We implemented the method in a tool and illustrate its suitability for root cause analysis by applying it to a sample scenario.",0
"The performance of Neural Network (NN)-based language models is steadily improving due to the emergence of new architectures, which are able to learn different natural language characteristics. This paper presents a novel framework, which shows that a significant improvement can be achieved by combining different existing heterogeneous models in a single architecture. This is done through 1) a feature layer, which separately learns different NN-based models and 2) a mixture layer, which merges the resulting model features. In doing so, this architecture benefits from the learning capabilities of each model with no noticeable increase in the number of model parameters or the training time. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward as well as recurrent neural network architectures.",0
"In the recent years, the problem of identifying suspicious behavior has gained importance and identifying this behavior using computational systems and autonomous algorithms is highly desirable in a tactical scenario. So far, the solutions have been primarily manual which elicit human observation of entities to discern the hostility of the situation. To cater to this problem statement, a number of fully automated and partially automated solutions exist. But, these solutions lack the capability of learning from experiences and work in conjunction with human supervision which is extremely prone to error. In this paper, a generalized methodology to predict the hostility of a given object based on its movement patterns is proposed which has the ability to learn and is based upon the mechanism of humans of learning from experiences. The methodology so proposed has been implemented in a computer simulation. The results show that the posited methodology has the potential to be applied in real world tactical scenarios.",0
"Since exact probabilistic inference is intractable in general for large multiply connected belief nets, approximate methods are required. A promising approach is to use heuristic search among hypotheses (instantiations of the network) to find the most probable ones, as in the TopN algorithm. Search is based on the relative probabilities of hypotheses which are efficient to compute. Given upper and lower bounds on the relative probability of partial hypotheses, it is possible to obtain bounds on the absolute probabilities of hypotheses. Best-first search aimed at reducing the maximum error progressively narrows the bounds as more hypotheses are examined. Here, qualitative probabilistic analysis is employed to obtain bounds on the relative probability of partial hypotheses for the BN20 class of networks networks and a generalization replacing the noisy OR assumption by negative synergy. The approach is illustrated by application to a very large belief network, QMR-BN, which is a reformulation of the Internist-1 system for diagnosis in internal medicine.",0
"In multilingual question answering, either the question needs to be translated into the document language, or vice versa. In addition to direction, there are multiple methods to perform the translation, four of which we explore in this paper: word-based, 10-best, context-based, and grammar-based. We build a feature for each combination of translation direction and method, and train a model that learns optimal feature weights. On a large forum dataset consisting of posts in English, Arabic, and Chinese, our novel learn-to-translate approach was more effective than a strong baseline (p&lt;0.05): translating all text into English, then training a classifier based only on English (original or translated) text.",1
"There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and motivations future AGIs will have. In some plausible scenarios, AGIs may pose security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments, make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem - the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available mechanisms, and weaknesses that need to be addressed.",0
"Software design is crucial to successful software development, yet is a demanding multi-objective problem for software engineers. In an attempt to assist the software designer, interactive (i.e. human in-the-loop) meta-heuristic search techniques such as evolutionary computing have been applied and show promising results. Recent investigations have also shown that Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) can outperform evolutionary computing as a potential search engine for interactive software design. With a limited computational budget, ACO produces superior candidate design solutions in a smaller number of iterations. Building on these findings, we propose a novel interactive ACO (iACO) approach to assist the designer in early lifecycle software design, in which the search is steered jointly by subjective designer evaluation as well as machine fitness functions relating the structural integrity and surrogate elegance of software designs. Results show that iACO is speedy, responsive and highly effective in enabling interactive, dynamic multi-objective search in early lifecycle software design. Study participants rate the iACO search experience as compelling. Results of machine learning of fitness measure weightings indicate that software design elegance does indeed play a significant role in designer evaluation of candidate software design. We conclude that the evenness of the number of attributes and methods among classes (NAC) is a significant surrogate elegance measure, which in turn suggests that this evenness of distribution, when combined with structural integrity, is an implicit but crucial component of effective early lifecycle software design.",0
"Searching for and making decisions about information is becoming increasingly difficult as the amount of information and number of choices increases. Recommendation systems help users find items of interest of a particular type, such as movies or restaurants, but are still somewhat awkward to use. Our solution is to take advantage of the complementary strengths of personalized recommendation systems and dialogue systems, creating personalized aides. We present a system -- the Adaptive Place Advisor -- that treats item selection as an interactive, conversational process, with the program inquiring about item attributes and the user responding. Individual, long-term user preferences are unobtrusively obtained in the course of normal recommendation dialogues and used to direct future conversations with the same user. We present a novel user model that influences both item search and the questions asked during a conversation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in significantly reducing the time and number of interactions required to find a satisfactory item, as compared to a control group of users interacting with a non-adaptive version of the system.",0
"Bayesian networks can be used to extract explanations about the observed state of a subset of variables. In this paper, we explicate the desiderata of an explanation and confront them with the concept of explanation proposed by existing methods. The necessity of taking into account causal approaches when a causal graph is available is discussed. We then introduce causal explanation trees, based on the construction of explanation trees using the measure of causal information ow (Ay and Polani, 2006). This approach is compared to several other methods on known networks.",0
"We present a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that formulates each task in the hierarchy as a special type of Markov decision process for which the Bellman equation is linear and has analytical solution. Problems of this type, called linearly-solvable MDPs (LMDPs) have interesting properties that can be exploited in a hierarchical setting, such as efficient learning of the optimal value function or task compositionality. The proposed hierarchical approach can also be seen as a novel alternative to solving LMDPs with large state spaces. We derive a hierarchical version of the so-called Z-learning algorithm that learns different tasks simultaneously and show empirically that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in two classical hierarchical reinforcement learning domains: the taxi domain and an autonomous guided vehicle task.",0
"This paper demonstrates the use of neural networks for developing a system that can recognize hand-written English alphabets.

"As demand drives systems to generalize to various domains and problems, the study of multitask, transfer and lifelong learning has become an increasingly important pursuit. In discrete domains, performance on the Atari game suite has emerged as the de facto benchmark for assessing multitask learning. However, in continuous domains there is a lack of agreement on standard multitask evaluation environments which makes it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. In this work, we describe a benchmark set of tasks that we have developed in an extendable framework based on OpenAI Gym. We run a simple baseline using Trust Region Policy Optimization and release the framework publicly to be expanded and used for the systematic comparison of multitask, transfer, and lifelong learning in continuous domains.",0
"The growing adoption of IT-systems for modeling and executing (business) processes or services has thrust the scientific investigation towards techniques and tools which support more complex forms of process analysis. Many of them, such as conformance checking, process alignment, mining and enhancement, rely on complete observation of past (tracked and logged) executions. In many real cases, however, the lack of human or IT-support on all the steps of process execution, as well as information hiding and abstraction of model and data, result in incomplete log information of both data and activities. This paper tackles the issue of automatically repairing traces with missing information by notably considering not only activities but also data manipulated by them. Our technique recasts such a problem in a reachability problem and provides an encoding in an action language which allows to virtually use any state-of-the-art planning to return solutions.",0
"File type identification and file type clustering may be difficult tasks that have an increasingly importance in the field of computer and network security. Classical methods of file type detection including considering file extensions and magic bytes can be easily spoofed. Content-based file type detection is a newer way that is taken into account recently. In this paper, a new content-based method for the purpose of file type detection and file type clustering is proposed that is based on the PCA and neural networks. The proposed method has a good accuracy and is fast enough.",0
"This paper examines the problem of constructing belief networks to evaluate plans produced by an knowledge-based planner. Techniques are presented for handling various types of complicating plan features. These include plans with context-dependent consequences, indirect consequences, actions with preconditions that must be true during the execution of an action, contingencies, multiple levels of abstraction multiple execution agents with partially-ordered and temporally overlapping actions, and plans which reference specific times and time durations.",0
"The algorithmic Markov condition states that the most likely causal direction between two random variables X and Y can be identified as that direction with the lowest Kolmogorov complexity. Due to the halting problem, however, this notion is not computable.",0
"We describe a representation in a high-level transition system for policies that express a reactive behavior for the agent. We consider a target decision component that figures out what to do next and an (online) planning capability to compute the plans needed to reach these targets. Our representation allows one to analyze the flow of executing the given reactive policy, and to determine whether it works as expected. Additionally, the flexibility of the representation opens a range of possibilities for designing behaviors.",0
"Using deep neural nets as function approximator for reinforcement learning tasks have recently been shown to be very powerful for solving problems approaching real-world complexity. Using these results as a benchmark, we discuss the role that the discount factor may play in the quality of the learning process of a deep Q-network (DQN). When the discount factor progressively increases up to its final value, we empirically show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of learning steps. When used in conjunction with a varying learning rate, we empirically show that it outperforms original DQN on several experiments. We relate this phenomenon with the instabilities of neural networks when they are used in an approximate Dynamic Programming setting. We also describe the possibility to fall within a local optimum during the learning process, thus connecting our discussion with the exploration/exploitation dilemma.",0
"Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human activity can be learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort to date has concentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical properties of groups of people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on modeling actual successful executions (and not failed or attempted executions) of the activities of interest. We, in contrast, take on the task of understanding human interactions, attempted interactions, and intentions from noisy sensor data in a fully relational multi-agent setting. We use a real-world game of capture the flag to illustrate our approach in a well-defined domain that involves many distinct cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain using Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level activities, such as a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area, the motion model of the players, and by the rules and dynamics of the game in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion. We show that while it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it. Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed multi-agent activities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts at the same activities, our system automatically learns an augmented model that is capable of recognizing success and failure, as well as goals of peoples actions with high accuracy. We compare our approach with other alternatives and show that our unified model, which takes into account not only relationships among individual players, but also relationships among activities over the entire length of a game, although more computationally costly, is significantly more accurate. Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful attempts boosts performance on other important recognition tasks.",0
"With the development of community based question answering (Q\&amp;A) services, a large scale of Q\&amp;A archives have been accumulated and are an important information and knowledge resource on the web. Question and answer matching has been attached much importance to for its ability to reuse knowledge stored in these systems: it can be useful in enhancing user experience with recurrent questions. In this paper, we try to improve the matching accuracy by overcoming the lexical gap between question and answer pairs. A Word Embedding based Correlation (WEC) model is proposed by integrating advantages of both the translation model and word embedding, given a random pair of words, WEC can score their co-occurrence probability in Q\&amp;A pairs and it can also leverage the continuity and smoothness of continuous space word representation to deal with new pairs of words that are rare in the training parallel text. An experimental study on Yahoo! Answers dataset and Baidu Zhidao dataset shows this new method's promising potential.",1
"Distilling from a knowledge base only the part that is relevant to a subset of alphabet, which is recognized as forgetting, has attracted extensive interests in AI community. In standard propositional logic, a general algorithm of forgetting and its computation-oriented investigation in various fragments whose satisfiability are tractable are still lacking. The paper aims at filling the gap. After exploring some basic properties of forgetting in propositional logic, we present a resolution-based algorithm of forgetting for CNF fragment, and some complexity results about forgetting in Horn, renamable Horn, q-Horn, Krom, DNF and CNF fragments of propositional logic.",0
"Near-future electric distribution grids operation will have to rely on demand-side flexibility, both by implementation of demand response strategies and by taking advantage of the intelligent management of increasingly common small-scale energy storage. Home energy management systems (HEMS) will play a crucial role on the flexibility provision to both system operators and market players like aggregators. Modeling multi-period flexibility from residential consumers (HEMS flexibility), such as battery storage and electric water heater, while complying with internal constraints (comfort levels, data privacy) and uncertainty is a complex task. This paper describes a computational method that is capable of efficiently define and learn the feasible flexibility set from controllable resources connected to a HEMS. An Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) algorithm is adopted and reshaped to derive a set of feasible temporal trajectories for the residential net-load, considering storage, flexible appliances, and predefined costumer preferences, as well as load and photovoltaic (PV) forecast uncertainty. A support vector data description (SVDD) algorithm is used to build models capable of classifying feasible and unfeasible HEMS operating trajectories upon request from an optimization/control algorithm operated by a DSO or market player.",0
"Bike sharing systems' popularity has consistently been rising during the past years. Managing and maintaining these emerging systems are indispensable parts of these systems. Visualizing the current operations can assist in getting a better grasp on the performance of the system. In this paper, a data mining approach is used to identify and visualize some important factors related to bike-share operations and management. To consolidate the data, we cluster stations that have a similar pickup and drop-off profiles during weekdays and weekends. We provide the temporal profile of the center of each cluster which can be used as a simple and practical approach for approximating the number of pickups and drop-offs of the stations. We also define two indices based on stations' shortages and surpluses that reflect the degree of balancing aid a station needs. These indices can help stakeholders improve the quality of the bike-share user experience in at-least two ways. It can act as a complement to balancing optimization efforts, and it can identify stations that need expansion. We mine the District of Columbia's regional bike-share data and discuss the findings of this data set. We examine the bike-share system during different quarters of the year and during both peak and non-peak hours. Findings reflect that on weekdays most of the pickups and drop-offs happen during the morning and evening peaks whereas on weekends pickups and drop-offs are spread out throughout the day. We also show that throughout the day, more than 40% of the stations are relatively self-balanced. Not worrying about these stations during ordinary days can allow the balancing efforts to focus on a fewer stations and therefore potentially improve the efficiency of the balancing optimization models.",0
"Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared bike usage services for the public, have been launched in many big cities. In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a short-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and analyze individuals' bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
"In this paper, we present the Role Playing Learning (RPL) scheme for a mobile robot to navigate socially with its human companion in populated environments. Neural networks (NN) are constructed to parameterize a stochastic policy that directly maps sensory data collected by the robot to its velocity outputs, while respecting a set of social norms. An efficient simulative learning environment is built with maps and pedestrians trajectories collected from a number of real-world crowd data sets. In each learning iteration, a robot equipped with the NN policy is created virtually in the learning environment to play itself as a companied pedestrian and navigate towards a goal in a socially concomitant manner. Thus, we call this process Role Playing Learning, which is formulated under a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. The NN policy is optimized end-to-end using Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), with consideration of the imperfectness of robot's sensor measurements. Simulative and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our method.",0
"We formulate in this paper the mini-bucket algorithm for approximate inference in terms of exact inference on an approximate model produced by splitting nodes in a Bayesian network. The new formulation leads to a number of theoretical and practical implications. First, we show that branchand- bound search algorithms that use minibucket bounds may operate in a drastically reduced search space. Second, we show that the proposed formulation inspires new minibucket heuristics and allows us to analyze existing heuristics from a new perspective. Finally, we show that this new formulation allows mini-bucket approximations to benefit from recent advances in exact inference, allowing one to significantly increase the reach of these approximations.",0
"In this paper we describe an automatic generator to support the data scientist to construct, in a user-friendly way, dashboards from data represented as networks. The generator called SBINet (Semantic for Business Intelligence from Networks) has a semantic layer that, through ontologies, describes the data that represents a network as well as the possible metrics to be calculated in the network. Thus, with SBINet, the stages of the dashboard constructing process that uses complex network metrics are facilitated and can be done by users who do not necessarily know about complex networks.",0
"The Lumiere Project centers on harnessing probability and utility to provide assistance to computer software users. We review work on Bayesian user models that can be employed to infer a users needs by considering a user's background, actions, and queries. Several problems were tackled in Lumiere research, including (1) the construction of Bayesian models for reasoning about the time-varying goals of computer users from their observed actions and queries, (2) gaining access to a stream of events from software applications, (3) developing a language for transforming system events into observational variables represented in Bayesian user models, (4) developing persistent profiles to capture changes in a user expertise, and (5) the development of an overall architecture for an intelligent user interface. Lumiere prototypes served as the basis for the Office Assistant in the Microsoft Office '97 suite of productivity applications.",0
"This paper surveys the current state of the art in Natural Language Generation (NLG), defined as the task of generating text or speech from non-linguistic input. A survey of NLG is timely in view of the changes that the field has undergone over the past decade or so, especially in relation to new (usually data-driven) methods, as well as new applications of NLG technology. This survey therefore aims to (a) give an up-to-date synthesis of research on the core tasks in NLG and the architectures adopted in which such tasks are organised; (b) highlight a number of relatively recent research topics that have arisen partly as a result of growing synergies between NLG and other areas of artificial intelligence; (c) draw attention to the challenges in NLG evaluation, relating them to similar challenges faced in other areas of Natural Language Processing, with an emphasis on different evaluation methods and the relationships between them.",0
"Understanding why a model made a certain prediction is crucial in many data science fields. Interpretable predictions engender appropriate trust and provide insight into how the model may be improved. However, with large modern datasets the best accuracy is often achieved by complex models even experts struggle to interpret, which creates a tension between accuracy and interpretability. Recently, several methods have been proposed for interpreting predictions from complex models by estimating the importance of input features. Here, we present how a model-agnostic additive representation of the importance of input features unifies current methods. This representation is optimal, in the sense that it is the only set of additive values that satisfies important properties. We show how we can leverage these properties to create novel visual explanations of model predictions. The thread of unity that this representation weaves through the literature indicates that there are common principles to be learned about the interpretation of model predictions that apply in many scenarios.",0
"Association rules are among the most widely employed data analysis methods in the field of Data Mining. An association rule is a form of partial implication between two sets of binary variables. In the most common approach, association rules are parameterized by a lower bound on their confidence, which is the empirical conditional probability of their consequent given the antecedent, and/or by some other parameter bounds such as ""support"" or deviation from independence. We study here notions of redundancy among association rules from a fundamental perspective. We see each transaction in a dataset as an interpretation (or model) in the propositional logic sense, and consider existing notions of redundancy, that is, of logical entailment, among association rules, of the form ""any dataset in which this first rule holds must obey also that second rule, therefore the second is redundant"". We discuss several existing alternative definitions of redundancy between association rules and provide new characterizations and relationships among them. We show that the main alternatives we discuss correspond actually to just two variants, which differ in the treatment of full-confidence implications. For each of these two notions of redundancy, we provide a sound and complete deduction calculus, and we show how to construct complete bases (that is, axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size in terms of the number of rules. We explore finally an approach to redundancy with respect to several association rules, and fully characterize its simplest case of two partial premises.",0
"What are the limits of automated Twitter sentiment classification? We analyze a large set of manually labeled tweets in different languages, use them as training data, and construct automated classification models. It turns out that the quality of classification models depends much more on the quality and size of training data than on the type of the model trained. Experimental results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of the top classification models. We quantify the quality of training data by applying various annotator agreement measures, and identify the weakest points of different datasets. We show that the model performance approaches the inter-annotator agreement when the size of the training set is sufficiently large. However, it is crucial to regularly monitor the self- and inter-annotator agreements since this improves the training datasets and consequently the model performance. Finally, we show that there is strong evidence that humans perceive the sentiment classes (negative, neutral, and positive) as ordered.",0
"We consider the problem of maximizing monotone submodular functions under noise, which to the best of our knowledge has not been studied in the past. There has been a great deal of work on optimization of submodular functions under various constraints, with many algorithms that provide desirable approximation guarantees. However, in many applications we do not have access to the submodular function we aim to optimize, but rather to some erroneous or noisy version of it. This raises the question of whether provable guarantees are obtainable in presence of error and noise. We provide initial answers, by focusing on the question of maximizing a monotone submodular function under cardinality constraints when given access to a noisy oracle of the function. We show that:",0
"Stochastic search algorithms are among the most sucessful approaches for solving hard combinatorial problems. A large class of stochastic search approaches can be cast into the framework of Las Vegas Algorithms (LVAs). As the run-time behavior of LVAs is characterized by random variables, the detailed knowledge of run-time distributions provides important information for the analysis of these algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel methodology for evaluating the performance of LVAs, based on the identification of empirical run-time distributions. We exemplify our approach by applying it to Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for the satisfiability problem (SAT) in propositional logic. We point out pitfalls arising from the use of improper empirical methods and discuss the benefits of the proposed methodology for evaluating and comparing LVAs.",0
"With the increasing ubiquity of multi-capable, general-purpose robots arises the need for enabling non-expert users to command these robots to perform complex high-level tasks. To this end, high-level robot control has seen the application of formal methods to automatically synthesize correct-by-construction controllers from user-defined specifications; synthesis fails if and only if there exists no controller that achieves the specified behavior. Recent work has also addressed the challenge of providing easy-to-understand feedback to users when a specification fails to yield a corresponding controller. Existing techniques provide feedback on portions of the specification that cause the failure, but do so at a coarse granularity. This work presents techniques for refining this feedback, extracting minimal explanations of unsynthesizability.",0
"Arguments are essential objects in DirectDemocracyP2P, where they can occur both in association with signatures for petitions, or in association with other debated decisions, such as bug sorting by importance.

"We consider the problem of optimal planning in stochastic domains with resource constraints, where the resources are continuous and the choice of action at each step depends on resource availability. We introduce the HAO* algorithm, a generalization of the AO* algorithm that performs search in a hybrid state space that is modeled using both discrete and continuous state variables, where the continuous variables represent monotonic resources. Like other heuristic search algorithms, HAO* leverages knowledge of the start state and an admissible heuristic to focus computational effort on those parts of the state space that could be reached from the start state by following an optimal policy. We show that this approach is especially effective when resource constraints limit how much of the state space is reachable. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain that motivates our research: automated planning for planetary exploration rovers.",0
"Mixed Integer Optimization has been a topic of active research in past decades. It has been used to solve Statistical problems of classification and regression involving massive data. However, there is an inherent degree of vagueness present in huge real life data. This impreciseness is handled by Fuzzy Sets. In this Paper, Fuzzy Mixed Integer Optimization Method (FMIOM) is used to find solution to Regression problem. The methodology exploits discrete character of problem. In this way large scale problems are solved within practical limits. The data points are separated into different polyhedral regions and each region has its own distinct regression coefficients. In this attempt, an attention is drawn to Statistics and Data Mining community that Integer Optimization can be significantly used to revisit different Statistical problems. Computational experimentations with generated and real data sets show that FMIOM is comparable to and often outperforms current leading methods. The results illustrate potential for significant impact of Fuzzy Integer Optimization methods on Computational Statistics and Data Mining.",0
"Composition of low-dimensional distributions, whose foundations were laid in the papaer published in the Proceeding of UAI'97 (Jirousek 1997), appeared to be an alternative apparatus to describe multidimensional probabilistic models. In contrast to Graphical Markov Models, which define multidomensinoal distributions in a declarative way, this approach is rather procedural. Ordering of low-dimensional distributions into a proper sequence fully defines the resepctive computational procedure; therefore, a stury of different type of generating sequences is one fo the central problems in this field. Thus, it appears that an important role is played by special sequences that are called perfect. Their main characterization theorems are presetned in this paper. However, the main result of this paper is a solution to the problem of margnialization for general sequences. The main theorem describes a way to obtain a generating sequence that defines the model corresponding to the marginal of the distribution defined by an arbitrary genearting sequence. From this theorem the reader can see to what extent these comutations are local; i.e., the sequence consists of marginal distributions whose computation must be made by summing up over the values of the variable eliminated (the paper deals with finite model).",0
"The study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by Dung (Artificial Intelligence 177, 1995) has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J. Logic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung's framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).",0
"While known algorithms for sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning in probabilistic networks have a running time that is exponential in the size of the network, the exact computational complexity of these problems has not been established as yet. In this paper we study several variants of the tuning problem and show that these problems are NPPP-complete in general. We further show that the problems remain NP-complete or PP-complete, for a number of restricted variants. These complexity results provide insight in whether or not recent achievements in sensitivity analysis and tuning can be extended to more general, practicable methods.",0
"Markov decision processes (MDPs) are widely used in modeling decision making problems in stochastic environments. However, precise specification of the reward functions in MDPs is often very difficult. Recent approaches have focused on computing an optimal policy based on the minimax regret criterion for obtaining a robust policy under uncertainty in the reward function. One of the core tasks in computing the minimax regret policy is to obtain the set of all policies that can be optimal for some candidate reward function. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm that exploits the geometric properties of the reward function associated with the policies. We also present an approximate version of the method for further speed up. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm improves the performance by orders of magnitude.",0
"Multi-instance learning attempts to learn from a training set consisting of labeled bags each containing many unlabeled instances. Previous studies typically treat the instances in the bags as independently and identically distributed. However, the instances in a bag are rarely independent, and therefore a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non-i.i.d. way that exploits the relations among instances. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-instance learning method, which regards each bag as a graph and uses a specific kernel to distinguish the graphs by considering the features of the nodes as well as the features of the edges that convey some relations among instances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments.",1
"General game playing artificial intelligence has recently seen important advances due to the various techniques known as 'deep learning'. However the advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any human-level complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well. The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:",0
"Forward inference techniques such as sequential Monte Carlo and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo for probabilistic programming can be implemented in any programming language by creative use of standardized operating system functionality including processes, forking, mutexes, and shared memory. Exploiting this we have defined, developed, and tested a probabilistic programming language intermediate representation language we call probabilistic C, which itself can be compiled to machine code by standard compilers and linked to operating system libraries yielding an efficient, scalable, portable probabilistic programming compilation target. This opens up a new hardware and systems research path for optimizing probabilistic programming systems.",1
"This paper presents a combination of several automated reasoning and proof presentation tools with the Mizar system for formalization of mathematics. The combination forms an online service called MizAR, similar to the SystemOnTPTP service for first-order automated reasoning. The main differences to SystemOnTPTP are the use of the Mizar language that is oriented towards human mathematicians (rather than the pure first-order logic used in SystemOnTPTP), and setting the service in the context of the large Mizar Mathematical Library of previous theorems,definitions, and proofs (rather than the isolated problems that are solved in SystemOnTPTP). These differences poses new challenges and new opportunities for automated reasoning and for proof presentation tools. This paper describes the overall structure of MizAR, and presents the automated reasoning systems and proof presentation tools that are combined to make MizAR a useful mathematical service.",0
"The rules of d-separation provide a framework for deriving conditional independence facts from model structure. However, this theory only applies to simple directed graphical models.

"Symmetry is the essential element of lifted inference that has recently demon- strated the possibility to perform very efficient inference in highly-connected, but symmetric probabilistic models models. This raises the question, whether this holds for optimisation problems in general. Here we show that for a large class of optimisation methods this is actually the case. More precisely, we introduce the concept of fractional symmetries of convex quadratic programs (QPs), which lie at the heart of many machine learning approaches, and exploit it to lift, i.e., to compress QPs. These lifted QPs can then be tackled with the usual optimization toolbox (off-the-shelf solvers, cutting plane algorithms, stochastic gradients etc.). If the original QP exhibits symmetry, then the lifted one will generally be more compact, and hence their optimization is likely to be more efficient.",0
"The paper proposes a fresh look at the concept of goal and advances that motivational attitudes like desire, goal and intention are just facets of the broader notion of (acceptable) outcome. We propose to encode the preferences of an agent as sequences of ""alternative acceptable outcomes"". We then study how the agent's beliefs and norms can be used to filter the mental attitudes out of the sequences of alternative acceptable outcomes. Finally, we formalise such intuitions in a novel Modal Defeasible Logic and we prove that the resulting formalisation is computationally feasible.",0
"PDDL+ is an extension of PDDL that enables modelling planning domains with mixed discrete-continuous dynamics. In this paper we present a new approach to PDDL+ planning based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), i.e. ASP rules plus numerical constraints. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to link PDDL+ planning and logic programming. We provide an encoding of PDDL+ models into CASP problems. The encoding can handle non-linear hybrid domains, and represents a solid basis for applying logic programming to PDDL+ planning. As a case study, we consider the EZCSP CASP solver and obtain promising results on a set of PDDL+ benchmark problems.",0
"Factoid question answering (QA) has recently benefited from the development of deep learning (DL) systems. Neural network models outperform traditional approaches in domains where large datasets exist, such as SQuAD (ca. 100,000 questions) for Wikipedia articles. However, these systems have not yet been applied to QA in more specific domains, such as biomedicine, because datasets are generally too small to train a DL system from scratch. For example, the BioASQ dataset for biomedical QA comprises less then 900 factoid (single answer) and list (multiple answers) QA instances. In this work, we adapt a neural QA system trained on a large open-domain dataset (SQuAD, source) to a biomedical dataset (BioASQ, target) by employing various transfer learning techniques. Our network architecture is based on a state-of-the-art QA system, extended with biomedical word embeddings and a novel mechanism to answer list questions. In contrast to existing biomedical QA systems, our system does not rely on domain-specific ontologies, parsers or entity taggers, which are expensive to create. Despite this fact, our systems achieve state-of-the-art results on factoid questions and competitive results on list questions.",0
"Automatic analysis of biomedical time series such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals has attracted great interest in the community of biomedical engineering due to its important applications in medicine. In this work, a simple yet effective bag-of-words representation that is able to capture both local and global structure similarity information is proposed for biomedical time series representation. In particular, similar to the bag-of-words model used in text document domain, the proposed method treats a time series as a text document and extracts local segments from the time series as words. The biomedical time series is then represented as a histogram of codewords, each entry of which is the count of a codeword appeared in the time series. Although the temporal order of the local segments is ignored, the bag-of-words representation is able to capture high-level structural information because both local and global structural information are well utilized. The performance of the bag-of-words model is validated on three datasets extracted from real EEG and ECG signals. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is not only insensitive to parameters of the bag-of-words model such as local segment length and codebook size, but also robust to noise.",0
"Cybersecurity is increasingly threatened by advanced and persistent attacks. As these attacks are often designed to disable a system (or a critical resource, e.g., a user account) repeatedly, it is crucial for the defender to keep updating its security measures to strike a balance between the risk of being compromised and the cost of security updates. Moreover, these decisions often need to be made with limited and delayed feedback due to the stealthy nature of advanced attacks. In addition to targeted attacks, such an optimal timing policy under incomplete information has broad applications in cybersecurity. Examples include key rotation, password change, application of patches, and virtual machine refreshing. However, rigorous studies of optimal timing are rare. Further, existing solutions typically rely on a pre-defined attack model that is known to the defender, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we make an initial effort towards achieving optimal timing of security updates in the face of unknown stealthy attacks. We consider a variant of the influential FlipIt game model with asymmetric feedback and unknown attack time distribution, which provides a general model to consecutive security updates. The defender's problem is then modeled as a time associative bandit problem with dependent arms. We derive upper confidence bound based learning policies that achieve low regret compared with optimal periodic defense strategies that can only be derived when attack time distributions are known.",1
"In this paper, the continuity and strong continuity in domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras are introduced respectively. A more general concept of continuous function which is defined between two domain-free continuous information algebras is presented. It is shown that, with the operations combination and focusing, the set of all continuous functions between two domain-free s-continuous information algebras forms a new s-continuous information algebra. By studying the relationship between domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras, it is demonstrated that they do correspond to each other on s-compactness.",0
"We undertook a study of the use of a memristor network for music generation, making use of the memristor's memory to go beyond the Markov hypothesis. Seed transition matrices are created and populated using memristor equations, and which are shown to generate musical melodies and change in style over time as a result of feedback into the transition matrix. The spiking properties of simple memristor networks are demonstrated and discussed with reference to applications of music making. The limitations of simulating composing memristor networks in von Neumann hardware is discussed and a hardware solution based on physical memristor properties is presented.",0
"The application of cognitive mechanisms to support knowledge acquisition is, from our point of view, crucial for making the resulting models coherent, efficient, credible, easy to use and understandable. In particular, there are two characteristic features of intelligence that are essential for knowledge development: forgetting and consolidation. Both plays an important role in knowledge bases and learning systems to avoid possible information overflow and redundancy, and in order to preserve and strengthen important or frequently used rules and remove (or forget) useless ones. We present an incremental, long-life view of knowledge acquisition which tries to improve task after task by determining what to keep, what to consolidate and what to forget, overcoming The Stability-Plasticity dilemma. In order to do that, we rate rules by introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical assessment structure which treats evidence and rules in a unified way. The metrics are not only used to forget some of the worst rules, but also to set a consolidation process to promote those selected rules to the knowledge base, which is also mirrored by a demotion system. We evaluate the framework with a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain.",0
"In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.

"The explosive growth of the location-enabled devices coupled with the increasing use of Internet services has led to an increasing awareness of the importance and usage of geospatial information in many applications. The navigation apps (often called Maps), use a variety of available data sources to calculate and predict the travel time as well as several options for routing in public transportation, car or pedestrian modes. This paper evaluates the pedestrian mode of Maps apps in three major smartphone operating systems (Android, iOS and Windows Phone). In the paper, we will show that the Maps apps on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in pedestrian mode, predict travel time without learning from the individual's movement profile. In addition, we will exemplify that those apps suffer from a specific data quality issue which relates to the absence of information about location and type of pedestrian crossings. Finally, we will illustrate learning from movement profile of individuals using various predictive analytics models to improve the accuracy of travel time estimation.",0
"3D city models - which represent in 3 dimensions the geometric elements of a city - are increasingly used for an intended wide range of applications. Such uses are made possible by using semantically enriched 3D city models and by presenting such enriched 3D city models in a way that allows decision-making processes to be carried out from the best choices among sets of objectives, and across issues and scales. In order to help in such a decision-making process we have defined a framework to find the best visualization technique(s) for a set of potentially heterogeneous data that have to be visualized within the same 3D city model, in order to perform a given task in a specific context. We have chosen an ontology-based approach. This approach and the specification and use of the resulting ontology of 3D visualization techniques are described in this paper.",0
"Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is a popular approach that cuts down on the classical planning search space by relying on a given hierarchical library of domain control knowledge. This provides an intuitive methodology for specifying high-level instructions on how robots and agents should perform tasks, while also giving the planner enough flexibility to choose the lower-level steps and their ordering. In this paper we present the HATP (Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner) planning framework which extends the traditional HTN planning domain representation and semantics by making them more suitable for roboticists, and treating agents as ""first class"" entities in the language. The former is achieved by allowing ""social rules"" to be defined which specify what behaviour is acceptable/unacceptable by the agents/robots in the domain, and interleaving planning with geometric reasoning in order to validate online -with respect to a detailed geometric 3D world- the human/robot actions currently being pursued by HATP.",0
"We set up a model for reasoning about metric spaces with belief theoretic measures. The uncertainty in these spaces stems from both probability and metric. To represent both aspect of uncertainty, we choose an expected distance function as a measure of uncertainty. A formal logical system is constructed for the reasoning about expected distance. Soundness and completeness are shown for this logic. For reasoning on product metric space with uncertainty, a new metric is defined and shown to have good properties.",0
"Network data mining has become an important area of study due to the large number of problems it can be applied to. This paper presents NOESIS, an open source framework for network data mining that provides a large collection of network analysis techniques, including the analysis of network structural properties, community detection methods, link scoring, and link prediction, as well as network visualization algorithms. It also features a complete stand-alone graphical user interface that facilitates the use of all these techniques. The NOESIS framework has been designed using solid object-oriented design principles and structured parallel programming. As a lightweight library with minimal external dependencies and a permissive software license, NOESIS can be incorporated into other software projects. Released under a BSD license, it is available from",0
"The dynamics of belief and knowledge is one of the major components of any autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. In this paper, we argue that to apply rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first of all, it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for Horn knowledge bases. We show that Horn knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change and abduction. Finally, we also show that both variants are rational in the sense that they satisfy certain rationality postulates stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics.",0
"The hyperclimbing hypothesis is a hypothetical explanation for adaptation in genetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). Hyperclimbing is an intuitive, general-purpose, non-local search heuristic applicable to discrete product spaces with rugged or stochastic cost functions. The strength of this heuristic lie in its insusceptibility to local optima when the cost function is deterministic, and its tolerance for noise when the cost function is stochastic. Hyperclimbing works by decimating a search space, i.e. by iteratively fixing the values of small numbers of variables. The hyperclimbing hypothesis holds that UGAs work by implementing efficient hyperclimbing. Proof of concept for this hypothesis comes from the use of a novel analytic technique involving the exploitation of algorithmic symmetry. We have also obtained experimental results that show that a simple tweak inspired by the hyperclimbing hypothesis dramatically improves the performance of a UGA on large, random instances of MAX-3SAT and the Sherrington Kirkpatrick Spin Glasses problem.",0
"We study the relations between Multi-valued Decision Diagrams (MDD) and tuples (i.e. elements of the Cartesian Product of variables). First, we improve the existing methods for transforming a set of tuples, Global Cut Seeds, sequences of tuples into MDDs. Then, we present some in-place algorithms for adding and deleting tuples from an MDD. Next, we consider an MDD constraint which is modified during the search by deleting some tuples. We give an algorithm which adapts MDD-4R to these dynamic and persistent modifications. Some experiments show that MDD constraints are competitive with Table constraints.",0
"In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the emotion of a song based on its lyrical and audio features. Lyrical features are generated by segmentation of lyrics during the process of data extraction. ANEW and WordNet knowledge is then incorporated to compute Valence and Arousal values. In addition to this, linguistic association rules are applied to ensure that the issue of ambiguity is properly addressed. Audio features are used to supplement the lyrical ones and include attributes like energy, tempo, and danceability. These features are extracted from The Echo Nest, a widely used music intelligence platform. Construction of training and test sets is done on the basis of social tags extracted from the last.fm website. The classification is done by applying feature weighting and stepwise threshold reduction on the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to provide fuzziness in the classification.",0
"Community based question answering (CQA) services receive a large volume of questions today. It is increasingly challenging to motivate domain experts to give timely answers. Recently, payment-based CQA services explore new incentive models to engage real-world experts and celebrities by allowing them to set a price on their answers. In this paper, we perform a data-driven analysis on Fenda, a payment-based CQA service that has gained initial success with this incentive model. Using a large dataset of 220K paid questions (worth 1 million USD) over two months, we examine how monetary incentives affect different players in the system and their over-time engagement. Our study reveals several key findings: while monetary incentive enables quick answers from experts, it also drives certain users to aggressively game the systems for profits. In addition, this incentive model turns CQA service into a supplier-driven marketplace where users need to proactively adjust their price as needed. We find famous people are unwilling to lower their price, which in turn hurts their income and engagement-level over time. Based on our results, we discuss the implications to future payment-based CQA design.",0
"Neutrosophic Statistics means statistical analysis of population or sample that has indeterminate (imprecise, ambiguous, vague, incomplete, unknown) data. For example, the population or sample size might not be exactly determinate because of some individuals that partially belong to the population or sample, and partially they do not belong, or individuals whose appurtenance is completely unknown. Also, there are population or sample individuals whose data could be indeterminate. In this book, we develop the 1995 notion of neutrosophic statistics. We present various practical examples. It is possible to define the neutrosophic statistics in many ways, because there are various types of indeterminacies, depending on the problem to solve.",0
"Distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) problems are a popular way of formulating and solving agent-coordination problems. A DCOP problem is a problem where several agents coordinate their values such that the sum of the resulting constraint costs is minimal. It is often desirable to solve DCOP problems with memory-bounded and asynchronous algorithms. We introduce Branch-and-Bound ADOPT (BnB-ADOPT), a memory-bounded asynchronous DCOP search algorithm that uses the message-passing and communication framework of ADOPT (Modi, Shen, Tambe, and Yokoo, 2005), a well known memory-bounded asynchronous DCOP search algorithm, but changes the search strategy of ADOPT from best-first search to depth-first branch-and-bound search. Our experimental results show that BnB-ADOPT finds cost-minimal solutions up to one order of magnitude faster than ADOPT for a variety of large DCOP problems and is as fast as NCBB, a memory-bounded synchronous DCOP search algorithm, for most of these DCOP problems. Additionally, it is often desirable to find bounded-error solutions for DCOP problems within a reasonable amount of time since finding cost-minimal solutions is NP-hard. The existing bounded-error approximation mechanism allows users only to specify an absolute error bound on the solution cost but a relative error bound is often more intuitive. Thus, we present two new bounded-error approximation mechanisms that allow for relative error bounds and implement them on top of BnB-ADOPT.",0
"The social network analysis (SNA), branch of complex systems can be used in the construction of multiagent systems. This paper proposes a study of how social network analysis can assist in modeling multiagent systems, while addressing similarities and differences between the two theories. We built a prototype of multi-agent systems for resolution of tasks through the formation of teams of agents that are formed on the basis of the social network established between agents. Agents make use of performance indicators to assess when should change their social network to maximize the participation in teams",0
"In this research, we investigate the subject of path-finding. A pruned version of visibility graph based on Candidate Vertices is formulated, followed by a new visibility check technique. Such combination enables us to quickly identify the useful vertices and thus find the optimal path more efficiently. The algorithm proposed is demonstrated on various path-finding cases. The performance of the new technique on visibility graphs is compared to the traditional A* on Grids, Theta* and A* on Visibility Graphs in terms of path length, number of nodes evaluated, as well as computational time. The key algorithmic contribution is that the new approach combines the merits of grid-based method and visibility graph-based method and thus yields better overall performance.",0
"Information about user preferences plays a key role in automated decision making. In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. In this paper, we propose a qualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates (is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.",0
"The categorial approach to evidential reasoning can be seen as a combination of the probability kinematics approach of Richard Jeffrey (1965) and the maximum (cross-) entropy inference approach of E. T. Jaynes (1957). As a consequence of that viewpoint, it is well known that category theory provides natural definitions for logical connectives. In particular, disjunction and conjunction are modelled by general categorial constructions known as products and coproducts. In this paper, I focus mainly on Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions for which I introduce a category I call Dempster?s category. I prove the existence of and give explicit formulas for conjunction and disjunction in the subcategory of separable belief functions. In Dempster?s category, the new defined conjunction can be seen as the most cautious conjunction of beliefs, and thus no assumption about distinctness (of the sources) of beliefs is needed as opposed to Dempster?s rule of combination, which calls for distinctness (of the sources) of beliefs.",0
"This paper presents two new approaches to decomposing and solving large Markov decision problems (MDPs), a partial decoupling method and a complete decoupling method. In these approaches, a large, stochastic decision problem is divided into smaller pieces. The first approach builds a cache of policies for each part of the problem independently, and then combines the pieces in a separate, light-weight step. A second approach also divides the problem into smaller pieces, but information is communicated between the different problem pieces, allowing intelligent decisions to be made about which piece requires the most attention. Both approaches can be used to find optimal policies or approximately optimal policies with provable bounds. These algorithms also provide a framework for the efficient transfer of knowledge across problems that share similar structure.",0
"The problem of finding small unsatisfiable cores for SAT formulas has recently received a lot of interest, mostly for its applications in formal verification. However, propositional logic is often not expressive enough for representing many interesting verification problems, which can be more naturally addressed in the framework of Satisfiability Modulo Theories, SMT. Surprisingly, the problem of finding unsatisfiable cores in SMT has received very little attention in the literature. In this paper we present a novel approach to this problem, called the Lemma-Lifting approach. The main idea is to combine an SMT solver with an external propositional core extractor. The SMT solver produces the theory lemmas found during the search, dynamically lifting the suitable amount of theory information to the Boolean level. The core extractor is then called on the Boolean abstraction of the original SMT problem and of the theory lemmas. This results in an unsatisfiable core for the original SMT problem, once the remaining theory lemmas are removed. The approach is conceptually interesting, and has several advantages in practice. In fact, it is extremely simple to implement and to update, and it can be interfaced with every propositional core extractor in a plug-and-play manner, so as to benefit for free of all unsat-core reduction techniques which have been or will be made available.",0
"This paper contributes a preliminary report on the advantages and disadvantages of incorporating simultaneous human control and feedback signals in the training of a reinforcement learning robotic agent. While robotic human-machine interfaces have become increasingly complex in both form and function, control remains challenging for users. This has resulted in an increasing gap between user control approaches and the number of robotic motors which can be controlled. One way to address this gap is to shift some autonomy to the robot. Semi-autonomous actions of the robotic agent can then be shaped by human feedback, simplifying user control. Most prior work on agent shaping by humans has incorporated training with feedback, or has included indirect control signals. By contrast, in this paper we explore how a human can provide concurrent feedback signals and real-time myoelectric control signals to train a robot's actor-critic reinforcement learning control system. Using both a physical and a simulated robotic system, we compare training performance on a simple movement task when reward is derived from the environment, when reward is provided by the human, and combinations of these two approaches. Our results indicate that some benefit can be gained with the inclusion of human generated feedback.",0
"We propose a higher-level associative memory for learning adversarial networks. Generative adversarial network (GAN) framework has a discriminator and a generator network. The generator (G) maps white noise (z) to data samples while the discriminator (D) maps data samples to a single scalar. To do so, G learns how to map from high-level representation space to data space, and D learns to do the opposite. We argue that higher-level representation spaces need not necessarily follow a uniform probability distribution. In this work, we use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as a higher-level associative memory and learn the probability distribution for the high-level features generated by D. The associative memory samples its underlying probability distribution and G learns how to map these samples to data space. The proposed associative adversarial networks (AANs) are generative models in the higher-levels of the learning, and use adversarial non-stochastic models D and G for learning the mapping between data and higher-level representation spaces. Experiments show the potential of the proposed networks.",0
"Since formulation of Inductive Database (IDB) problem, several Data Mining (DM) languages have been proposed, confirming that KDD process could be supported via inductive queries (IQ) answering. This paper reviews the existing DM languages. We are presenting important primitives of the DM language and classifying our languages according to primitives' satisfaction. In addition, we presented languages' syntaxes and tried to apply each one to a database sample to test a set of KDD operations. This study allows us to highlight languages capabilities and limits, which is very useful for future work and perspectives.",0

"We derive an equation for temporal difference learning from statistical principles. Specifically, we start with the variational principle and then bootstrap to produce an updating rule for discounted state value estimates. The resulting equation is similar to the standard equation for temporal difference learning with eligibility traces, so called TD(lambda), however it lacks the parameter alpha that specifies the learning rate. In the place of this free parameter there is now an equation for the learning rate that is specific to each state transition. We experimentally test this new learning rule against TD(lambda) and find that it offers superior performance in various settings. Finally, we make some preliminary investigations into how to extend our new temporal difference algorithm to reinforcement learning. To do this we combine our update equation with both Watkins' Q(lambda) and Sarsa(lambda) and find that it again offers superior performance without a learning rate parameter.",1
"To exploit the Web Ontology Language OWL as an answer set programming (ASP) language, we introduce the notion of bounded model semantics, as an intuitive and computationally advantageous alternative to its classical semantics. We show that a translation into ASP allows for solving a wide range of bounded-model reasoning tasks, including satisfiability and axiom entailment but also novel ones such as model extraction and enumeration. Ultimately, our work facilitates harnessing advanced semantic web modeling environments for the logic programming community through an ""off-label use"" of OWL.",0
"Problem solving in Answer Set Programming consists of two steps, a first grounding phase, systematically replacing all variables by terms, and a second solving phase computing the stable models of the obtained ground program. An intricate part of both phases is the treatment of aggregates, which are popular language constructs that allow for expressing properties over sets. In this paper, we elaborate upon the treatment of aggregates during grounding in Gringo series 4. Consequently, our approach is applicable to grounding based on semi-naive database evaluation techniques. In particular, we provide a series of algorithms detailing the treatment of recursive aggregates and illustrate this by a running example.",0
"Emotional content is a key element in user-generated videos. However, it is difficult to understand emotions conveyed in such videos due to the complex and unstructured nature of user-generated content and the sparsity of video frames that express emotion. In this paper, for the first time, we study the problem of transferring knowledge from heterogeneous external sources, including image and textual data, to facilitate three related tasks in video emotion understanding: emotion recognition, emotion attribution and emotion-oriented summarization. Specifically, our framework (1) learns a video encoding from an auxiliary emotional image dataset in order to improve supervised video emotion recognition, and (2) transfers knowledge from an auxiliary textual corpus for zero-shot \pl{recognition} of emotion classes unseen during training. The proposed technique for knowledge transfer facilitates novel applications of emotion attribution and emotion-oriented summarization. A comprehensive set of experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",0
"Since Pokemon Go sent millions on the quest of collecting virtual monsters, an important question has been on the minds of many people: Is going after the closest item first a time-and-cost-effective way to play? Here, we show that this is in fact a good strategy which performs on average only 7% worse than the best possible solution in terms of the total distance traveled to gather all the items. Even when accounting for errors due to the inability of people to accurately measure distances by eye, the performance only goes down to 16% of the optimal solution.",0
"Large-scale, parallel clusters composed of commodity processors are increasingly available, enabling the use of vast processing capabilities and distributed RAM to solve hard search problems. We investigate Hash-Distributed A* (HDA*), a simple approach to parallel best-first search that asynchronously distributes and schedules work among processors based on a hash function of the search state. We use this approach to parallelize the A* algorithm in an optimal sequential version of the Fast Downward planner, as well as a 24-puzzle solver. The scaling behavior of HDA* is evaluated experimentally on a shared memory, multicore machine with 8 cores, a cluster of commodity machines us- ing up to 64 cores, and a large-scale high-performance cluster using up to 1024 processors. We show that this approach scales well, allowing the effective utilization of large amount of distributed memory to optimally solve problems which require more than a terabyte of RAM. We also compare HDA* to Transposition-table Driven Scheduling (TDS), a hash-based parallelization of IDA*, and show that, in planning, HDA* significantly outperforms TDS. A simple hybrid which combines HDA* and TDS to exploit both of their strengths is proposed.",0
"We propose a novel method of regularization for recurrent neural networks called suprisal-driven zoneout. In this method, states \textit{zoneout} (maintain their previous value rather than updating), when the \textit{suprisal} (discrepancy between the last state's prediction and target) is small. Thus regularization is adaptive and input-driven on a per-neuron basis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea by achieving state-of-the-art bits per character of 1.32 on the Hutter Prize Wikipedia dataset, significantly reducing the gap to the best known highly-engineered compression methods.",0
"We investigate the computational complexity of testing dominance and consistency in CP-nets. Previously, the complexity of dominance has been determined for restricted classes in which the dependency graph of the CP-net is acyclic. However, there are preferences of interest that define cyclic dependency graphs; these are modeled with general CP-nets. In our main results, we show here that both dominance and consistency for general CP-nets are PSPACE-complete. We then consider the concept of strong dominance, dominance equivalence and dominance incomparability, and several notions of optimality, and identify the complexity of the corresponding decision problems. The reductions used in the proofs are from STRIPS planning, and thus reinforce the earlier established connections between both areas.",0
"We present a novel algorithm for anomaly detection on very large datasets and data streams. The method, named EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE), is kernel-based and able to efficiently compute the similarity between new data points and the distribution of regular data. The estimator is formulated as an inner product with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space embedding and makes no assumption about the type or shape of the underlying data distribution. We show that offline (batch) learning with EXPoSE can be done in linear time and online (incremental) learning takes constant time per instance and model update. Furthermore, EXPoSE can make predictions in constant time, while it requires only constant memory. In addition we propose different methodologies for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. On several real datasets we demonstrate that our approach can compete with state of the art algorithms for anomaly detection while being significant faster than techniques with the same discriminant power.",0
"Managing micro-tasks on crowdsourcing marketplaces involves balancing conflicting objectives -- the quality of work, total cost incurred and time to completion. Previous agents have focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, limiting their real-world applicability. As a step towards this goal we present Octopus, the first AI agent that jointly manages all three objectives in tandem. Octopus is based on a computationally tractable, multi-agent formulation consisting of three components; one that sets the price per ballot to adjust the rate of completion of tasks, another that optimizes each task for quality and a third that performs task selection. We demonstrate that Octopus outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in simulation and experiments with real data, demonstrating its superior performance. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk to establish its ability to manage tasks in a real-world, dynamic setting.",0
"We address the problem of finding the shortest path between two points in an unknown real physical environment, where a traveling agent must move around in the environment to explore unknown territory. We introduce the Physical-A* algorithm (PHA*) for solving this problem. PHA* expands all the mandatory nodes that A* would expand and returns the shortest path between the two points. However, due to the physical nature of the problem, the complexity of the algorithm is measured by the traveling effort of the moving agent and not by the number of generated nodes, as in standard A*. PHA* is presented as a two-level algorithm, such that its high level, A*, chooses the next node to be expanded and its low level directs the agent to that node in order to explore it. We present a number of variations for both the high-level and low-level procedures and evaluate their performance theoretically and experimentally. We show that the travel cost of our best variation is fairly close to the optimal travel cost, assuming that the mandatory nodes of A* are known in advance. We then generalize our algorithm to the multi-agent case, where a number of cooperative agents are designed to solve the problem. Specifically, we provide an experimental implementation for such a system. It should be noted that the problem addressed here is not a navigation problem, but rather a problem of finding the shortest path between two points for future usage.",0
"A long-standing dream of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has pursued to enrich computer programs with commonsense knowledge enabling machines to reason about our world. This paper offers a new practical insight towards the automation of commonsense reasoning with first-order logic (FOL) ontologies. We propose a new black-box testing methodology of FOL SUMO-based ontologies by exploiting WordNet and its mapping into SUMO. Our proposal includes a method for the (semi-)automatic creation of a very large set of tests and a procedure for its automated evaluation by using automated theorem provers (ATPs). Applying our testing proposal, we are able to successfully evaluate a) the competency of several translations of SUMO into FOL and b) the performance of various automated ATPs. In addition, we are also able to evaluate the resulting set of tests according to different quality criteria.",0
"Existing Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.",0
"Currently, potential threats of artificial intelligence (AI) to human have triggered a large controversy in society, behind which, the nature of the issue is whether the artificial intelligence (AI) system can be evaluated quantitatively. This article analyzes and evaluates the challenges that the AI development level is facing, and proposes that the evaluation methods for the human intelligence test and the AI system are not uniform; and the key reason for which is that none of the models can uniformly describe the AI system and the beings like human. Aiming at this problem, a standard intelligent system model is established in this study to describe the AI system and the beings like human uniformly. Based on the model, the article makes an abstract mathematical description, and builds the standard intelligent machine mathematical model; expands the Von Neumann architecture and proposes the Liufeng - Shiyong architecture; gives the definition of the artificial intelligence IQ, and establishes the artificial intelligence scale and the evaluation method; conduct the test on 50 search engines and three human subjects at different ages across the world, and finally obtains the ranking of the absolute IQ and deviation IQ ranking for artificial intelligence IQ 2014.",0
"Many systems of structured argumentation explicitly require that the facts and rules that make up the argument for a conclusion be the minimal set required to derive the conclusion. ASPIC+ does not place such a requirement on arguments, instead requiring that every rule and fact that are part of an argument be used in its construction. Thus ASPIC+ arguments are minimal in the sense that removing any element of the argument would lead to a structure that is not an argument. In this brief note we discuss these two types of minimality and show how the first kind of minimality can, if desired, be recovered in ASPIC+.",0
"Human vision greatly benefits from the information about sizes of objects. The role of size in several visual reasoning tasks has been thoroughly explored in human perception and cognition. However, the impact of the information about sizes of objects is yet to be determined in AI. We postulate that this is mainly attributed to the lack of a comprehensive repository of size information. In this paper, we introduce a method to automatically infer object sizes, leveraging visual and textual information from web. By maximizing the joint likelihood of textual and visual observations, our method learns reliable relative size estimates, with no explicit human supervision. We introduce the relative size dataset and show that our method outperforms competitive textual and visual baselines in reasoning about size comparisons.",1
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an effective science which employs strong enough approaches, methods, and techniques to solve unsolvable real world based problems. Because of its unstoppable rise towards the future, there are also some discussions about its ethics and safety. Shaping an AI friendly environment for people and a people friendly environment for AI can be a possible answer for finding a shared context of values for both humans and robots. In this context, objective of this paper is to address the ethical issues of AI and explore the moral dilemmas that arise from ethical algorithms, from pre set or acquired values. In addition, the paper will also focus on the subject of AI safety. As general, the paper will briefly analyze the concerns and potential solutions to solving the ethical issues presented and increase readers awareness on AI safety as another related research interest.",0
"Solomonoff induction is known to be universal, but incomputable. Its approximations, namely, the Minimum Description (or Message) Length (MDL) principles, are adopted in practice in the efficient, but non-universal form. Recent attempts to bridge this gap leaded to development of the Representational MDL principle that originates from formal decomposition of the task of induction. In this paper, possible extension of the RMDL principle in the context of universal intelligence agents is considered, for which introduction of representations is shown to be an unavoidable meta-heuristic and a step toward efficient general intelligence. Hierarchical representations and model optimization with the use of information-theoretic interpretation of the adaptive resonance are also discussed.",0
"This paper investigates a purely qualitative version of Savage's theory for decision making under uncertainty. Until now, most representation theorems for preference over acts rely on a numerical representation of utility and uncertainty where utility and uncertainty are commensurate. Disrupting the tradition, we relax this assumption and introduce a purely ordinal axiom requiring that the Decision Maker (DM) preference between two acts only depends on the relative position of their consequences for each state. Within this qualitative framework, we determine the only possible form of the decision rule and investigate some instances compatible with the transitivity of the strict preference. Finally we propose a mild relaxation of our ordinality axiom, leaving room for a new family of qualitative decision rules compatible with transitivity.",0
"Reinforcement learning is considered as a promising direction for driving policy learning. However, training autonomous driving vehicle with reinforcement learning in real environment involves non-affordable trial-and-error. It is more desirable to first train in a virtual environment and then transfer to the real environment. In this paper, we propose a novel realistic translation network to make model trained in virtual environment be workable in real world. The proposed network can convert non-realistic virtual image input into a realistic one with similar scene structure. Given realistic frames as input, driving policy trained by reinforcement learning can nicely adapt to real world driving. Experiments show that our proposed virtual to real (VR) reinforcement learning (RL) works pretty well. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of driving policy trained by reinforcement learning that can adapt to real world driving data.",0
"First-order probabilistic models combine representational power of first-order logic with graphical models. There is an ongoing effort to design lifted inference algorithms for first-order probabilistic models. We analyze lifted inference from the perspective of constraint processing and, through this viewpoint, we analyze and compare existing approaches and expose their advantages and limitations. Our theoretical results show that the wrong choice of constraint processing method can lead to exponential increase in computational complexity. Our empirical tests confirm the importance of constraint processing in lifted inference. This is the first theoretical and empirical study of constraint processing in lifted inference.",0
"We show how to transform any set of prioritized propositional defaults into an equivalent set of parallel (i.e., unprioritized) defaults, in circumscription. We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how to use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing algorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm as a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously available, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our algorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also alternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered class (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new query-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and complete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization partial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By contrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be layered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our algorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful class of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default inheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to represent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the implementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized circumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance with other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic programs with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to be representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions. Worst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We discuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds of situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive special case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In addition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited analytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform for a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming paper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result. One can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief confidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized) default. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel circumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2 degrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic theory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity suggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just as defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist, the transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a concept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in circumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach to equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.",0

"A research project aimed at the development of an automated theorem proving system was started in Kiev (Ukraine) in early 1960s. The mastermind of the project, Academician V.Glushkov, baptized it ""Evidence Algorithm"", EA. The work on the project lasted, off and on, more than 40 years. In the framework of the project, the Russian and English versions of the System for Automated Deduction, SAD, were constructed. They may be already seen as powerful theorem-proving assistants.",0
This paper describes the approach taken to the XML Mining track at INEX 2008 by a group at the Queensland University of Technology. We introduce the K-tree clustering algorithm in an Information Retrieval context by adapting it for document clustering. Many large scale problems exist in document clustering. K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity. It offers promising results both in terms of efficiency and quality. Document classification was completed using Support Vector Machines.,0
"We propose a new formal language for the expressive representation of probabilistic knowledge based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). It allows for the annotation of first-order formulas as well as ASP rules and facts with probabilities and for learning of such weights from data (parameter estimation). Weighted formulas are given a semantics in terms of soft and hard constraints which determine a probability distribution over answer sets. In contrast to related approaches, we approach inference by optionally utilizing so-called streamlining XOR constraints, in order to reduce the number of computed answer sets. Our approach is prototypically implemented. Examples illustrate the introduced concepts and point at issues and topics for future research.",0
"Probabilistic programming provides the means to represent and reason about complex probabilistic models using programming language constructs. Even simple probabilistic programs can produce models with infinitely many variables. Factored inference algorithms are widely used for probabilistic graphical models, but cannot be applied to these programs because all the variables and factors have to be enumerated. In this paper, we present a new inference framework, lazy factored inference (LFI), that enables factored algorithms to be used for models with infinitely many variables. LFI expands the model to a bounded depth and uses the structure of the program to precisely quantify the effect of the unexpanded part of the model, producing lower and upper bounds to the probability of the query.",0
"Probabilistic model-based diagnosis computes the posterior probabilities of failure of components from the prior probabilities of component failure and observations of system behavior. One problem with this method is that such priors are almost never directly available. One of the reasons is that the prior probability estimates include an implicit notion of a time interval over which they are specified -- for example, if the probability of failure of a component is 0.05, is this over the period of a day or is this over a week? A second problem facing probabilistic model-based diagnosis is the modeling of persistence. Say we have an observation about a system at time t_1 and then another observation at a later time t_2. To compute posterior probabilities that take into account both the observations, we need some model of how the state of the system changes from time t_1 to t_2. In this paper, we address these problems using techniques from Reliability theory. We show how to compute the failure prior of a component from an empirical measure of its reliability -- the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). We also develop a scheme to model persistence when handling multiple time tagged observations.",0
"Many of the artificial intelligence techniques developed to date rely on heuristic search through large spaces. Unfortunately, the size of these spaces and the corresponding computational effort reduce the applicability of otherwise novel and effective algorithms. A number of parallel and distributed approaches to search have considerably improved the performance of the search process. Our goal is to develop an architecture that automatically selects parallel search strategies for optimal performance on a variety of search problems. In this paper we describe one such architecture realized in the Eureka system, which combines the benefits of many different approaches to parallel heuristic search. Through empirical and theoretical analyses we observe that features of the problem space directly affect the choice of optimal parallel search strategy. We then employ machine learning techniques to select the optimal parallel search strategy for a given problem space. When a new search task is input to the system, Eureka uses features describing the search space and the chosen architecture to automatically select the appropriate search strategy. Eureka has been tested on a MIMD parallel processor, a distributed network of workstations, and a single workstation using multithreading. Results generated from fifteen puzzle problems, robot arm motion problems, artificial search spaces, and planning problems indicate that Eureka outperforms any of the tested strategies used exclusively for all problem instances and is able to greatly reduce the search time for these applications.",0
This paper presents the Voronoi diagram-based evolutionary algorithm (VorEAl). VorEAl partitions input space in abnormal/normal subsets using Voronoi diagrams. Diagrams are evolved using a multi-objective bio-inspired approach in order to conjointly optimize classification metrics while also being able to represent areas of the data space that are not present in the training dataset. As part of the paper VorEAl is experimentally validated and contrasted with similar approaches.,0
"This paper presents the computational logic foundations of a model of agency called the KGP (Knowledge, Goals and Plan model. This model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other, and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments. KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning, sensing and acting. Transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the dynamic context and agent preferences, as well as selection operators for providing inputs to transitions.",0
"We present ReAct!, an interactive tool for high-level reasoning for cognitive robotic applications. ReAct! enables robotic researchers to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains, without having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism in advance, and solve planning problems using state-of-the-art automated reasoners, without having to learn about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. It allows for embedding externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also enables users to solve planning problems that involve complex goals. Such variety of utilities are useful for robotic researchers to work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories. ReAct! provides sample formalizations of some action domains (e.g., multi-agent path planning, Tower of Hanoi), as well as dynamic simulations of plans computed by a state-of-the-art automated reasoner (e.g., a SAT solver or an ASP solver).",0
"The policy gradients of the expected return objective can react slowly to rare rewards. Yet, in some cases agents may wish to emphasize the low or high returns regardless of their probability. Borrowing from the economics and control literature, we review the risk-sensitive value function that arises from an exponential utility and illustrate its effects on an example. This risk-sensitive value function is not always applicable to reinforcement learning problems, so we introduce the particle value function defined by a particle filter over the distributions of an agent's experience, which bounds the risk-sensitive one. We illustrate the benefit of the policy gradients of this objective in Cliffworld.",0
"We introduce the first, general purpose, slice sampling inference engine for probabilistic programs. This engine is released as part of StocPy, a new Turing-Complete probabilistic programming language, available as a Python library. We present a transdimensional generalisation of slice sampling which is necessary for the inference engine to work on traces with different numbers of random variables. We show that StocPy compares favourably to other PPLs in terms of flexibility and usability, and that slice sampling can outperform previously introduced inference methods. Our experiments include a logistic regression, HMM, and Bayesian Neural Net.",0
"We describe methods for managing the complexity of information displayed to people responsible for making high-stakes, time-critical decisions. The techniques provide tools for real-time control of the configuration and quantity of information displayed to a user, and a methodology for designing flexible human-computer interfaces for monitoring applications. After defining a prototypical set of display decision problems, we introduce the expected value of revealed information (EVRI) and the related measure of expected value of displayed information (EVDI). We describe how these measures can be used to enhance computer displays used for monitoring complex systems. We motivate the presentation by discussing our efforts to employ decision-theoretic control of displays for a time-critical monitoring application at the NASA Mission Control Center in Houston.",0
"This paper extends previous work with network fragments and situation-specific network construction. We formally define the asymmetry network, an alternative representation for a conditional probability table. We also present an object-oriented representation for partially specified asymmetry networks. We show that the representation is parsimonious. We define an algebra for the elements of the representation that allows us to 'factor' any CPT and to soundly combine the partially specified asymmetry networks.",0
"Mechanical learning is a computing system that is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, and can learn from incoming data. A learning machine is a system that realizes mechanical learning. Importantly, we emphasis that it is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, contrasting to often called machine learning that is sophisticated software based on very complicated mathematical theory, and often needs human intervene for software fine tune and manual adjustments. Here, we discuss some basic facts and principles of such system, and try to lay down a framework for further study. We propose 2 directions to approach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to realize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical learning.",0
"The weekly maintenance schedule specifies when maintenance activities should be performed on the equipment, taking into account the availability of workers and maintenance bays, and other operational constraints. The current approach to generating this schedule is labour intensive and requires coordination between the maintenance schedulers and operations staff to minimise its impact on the operation of the mine. This paper presents methods for automatically generating this schedule from the list of maintenance tasks to be performed, the availability roster of the maintenance staff, and time windows in which each piece of equipment is available for maintenance. Both Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and genetic algorithms are evaluated, with the genetic algorithm shown to significantly outperform the MILP. Two fitness functions for the genetic algorithm are also examined, with a linear fitness function outperforming an inverse fitness function by up to 5% for the same calculation time. The genetic algorithm approach is computationally fast, allowing the schedule to be rapidly recalculated in response to unexpected delays and breakdowns.",0
"There are few knowledge representation (KR) techniques available for efficiently representing knowledge. However, with the increase in complexity, better methods are needed. Some researchers came up with hybrid mechanisms by combining two or more methods. In an effort to construct an intelligent computer system, a primary consideration is to represent large amounts of knowledge in a way that allows effective use and efficiently organizing information to facilitate making the recommended inferences. There are merits and demerits of combinations, and standardized method of KR is needed. In this paper, various hybrid schemes of KR were explored at length and details presented.",0
"With the purpose of modeling, specifying and reasoning in an integrated fashion with procedural and declarative aspects (both commonly present in cases or scenarios), the paper introduces Logic Programming Petri Nets (LPPN), an extension to the Petri Net notation providing an interface to logic programming constructs. Two semantics are presented. First, a hybrid operational semantics that separates the process component, treated with Petri nets, from the constraint/terminological component, treated with Answer Set Programming (ASP). Second, a denotational semantics maps the notation to ASP fully, via Event Calculus. These two alternative specifications enable a preliminary evaluation in terms of reasoning efficiency.",0
"We present a system for online monitoring of maritime activity over streaming positions from numerous vessels sailing at sea. It employs an online tracking module for detecting important changes in the evolving trajectory of each vessel across time, and thus can incrementally retain concise, yet reliable summaries of its recent movement. In addition, thanks to its complex event recognition module, this system can also offer instant notification to marine authorities regarding emergency situations, such as risk of collisions, suspicious moves in protected zones, or package picking at open sea. Not only did our extensive tests validate the performance, efficiency, and robustness of the system against scalable volumes of real-world and synthetically enlarged datasets, but its deployment against online feeds from vessels has also confirmed its capabilities for effective, real-time maritime surveillance.",0
"Biomedical researchers use ontologies to annotate their data with ontology terms, enabling better data integration and interoperability. However, the number, variety and complexity of current biomedical ontologies make it cumbersome for researchers to determine which ones to reuse for their specific needs. To overcome this problem, in 2010 the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) released the Ontology Recommender, which is a service that receives a biomedical text corpus or a list of keywords and suggests ontologies appropriate for referencing the indicated terms. We developed a new version of the NCBO Ontology Recommender. Called Ontology Recommender 2.0, it uses a new recommendation approach that evaluates the relevance of an ontology to biomedical text data according to four criteria: (1) the extent to which the ontology covers the input data; (2) the acceptance of the ontology in the biomedical community; (3) the level of detail of the ontology classes that cover the input data; and (4) the specialization of the ontology to the domain of the input data. Our evaluation shows that the enhanced recommender provides higher quality suggestions than the original approach, providing better coverage of the input data, more detailed information about their concepts, increased specialization for the domain of the input data, and greater acceptance and use in the community. In addition, it provides users with more explanatory information, along with suggestions of not only individual ontologies but also groups of ontologies. It also can be customized to fit the needs of different scenarios. Ontology Recommender 2.0 combines the strengths of its predecessor with a range of adjustments and new features that improve its reliability and usefulness. Ontology Recommender 2.0 recommends over 500 biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal platform, where it is openly available.",0
"We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. Existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry use corresponding feature points that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two else methods, termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method) and CTPM (curve tangent points method), for search epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on search correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolarline to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. Unfortunately these two methods give us only finite subset of solution, which usually include ""good"" solution, but don't allow us to find this ""good"" solution among this subset. Exception is the case of epipoles in infinity. The main reason for such result is inexactness of constant brightness assumption for smooth bodies. But outline and illumination characteristic points are not influenced this inexactness. So the first pair of methods gives exact result.",0
"Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) combines rule-based and statistical artificial intelligence methods, by learning a hypothesis comprising a set of rules given background knowledge and constraints for the search space. We focus on extending the XHAIL algorithm for ILP which is based on Answer Set Programming and we evaluate our extensions using the Natural Language Processing application of sentence chunking. With respect to processing natural language, ILP can cater for the constant change in how we use language on a daily basis. At the same time, ILP does not require huge amounts of training examples such as other statistical methods and produces interpretable results, that means a set of rules, which can be analysed and tweaked if necessary. As contributions we extend XHAIL with (i) a pruning mechanism within the hypothesis generalisation algorithm which enables learning from larger datasets, (ii) a better usage of modern solver technology using recently developed optimisation methods, and (iii) a time budget that permits the usage of suboptimal results. We evaluate these improvements on the task of sentence chunking using three datasets from a recent SemEval competition. Results show that our improvements allow for learning on bigger datasets with results that are of similar quality to state-of-the-art systems on the same task. Moreover, we compare the hypotheses obtained on datasets to gain insights on the structure of each dataset.",0
"We propose the concept of Action-Related Place (ARPlace) as a powerful and flexible representation of task-related place in the context of mobile manipulation. ARPlace represents robot base locations not as a single position, but rather as a collection of positions, each with an associated probability that the manipulation action will succeed when located there. ARPlaces are generated using a predictive model that is acquired through experience-based learning, and take into account the uncertainty the robot has about its own location and the location of the object to be manipulated.",0
"Multi-agent planning (MAP) approaches are typically oriented at solving loosely-coupled problems, being ineffective to deal with more complex, strongly-related problems. In most cases, agents work under complete information, building complete knowledge bases. The present article introduces a general-purpose MAP framework designed to tackle problems of any coupling levels under incomplete information. Agents in our MAP model are partially unaware of the information managed by the rest of agents and share only the critical information that affects other agents, thus maintaining a distributed vision of the task.",0
"We consider the task of obtaining the maximum a posteriori estimate of discrete pairwise random fields with arbitrary unary potentials and semimetric pairwise potentials. For this problem, we propose an accurate hierarchical move making strategy where each move is computed efficiently by solving an st-MINCUT problem. Unlike previous move making approaches, e.g. the widely used a-expansion algorithm, our method obtains the guarantees of the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation for the important special case of metric labeling. Unlike the existing LP relaxation solvers, e.g. interior-point algorithms or tree-reweighted message passing, our method is significantly faster as it uses only the efficient st-MINCUT algorithm in its design. Using both synthetic and real data experiments, we show that our technique outperforms several commonly used algorithms.",0
"The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization has gained momentum in recent years thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. While techniques to solve Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are abundant and have matured substantially since the field inception, the number of DCOP realistic applications and benchmark used to asses the performance of DCOP algorithms is lagging behind. To contrast this background we (i) introduce the Smart Home Device Scheduling (SHDS) problem, which describe the problem of coordinating smart devices schedules across multiple homes as a multi-agent system, (ii) detail the physical models adopted to simulate smart sensors, smart actuators, and homes environments, and (iii) introduce a DCOP realistic benchmark for SHDS problems.",0
"The ability to automatically generalise (interactive) proofs and use such generalisations to discharge related conjectures is a very hard problem which remains unsolved. Here, we develop a notion of goal types to capture key properties of goals, which enables abstractions over the specific order and number of sub-goals arising when composing tactics. We show that the goal types form a lattice, and utilise this property in the techniques we develop to automatically generalise proof strategies in order to reuse it for proofs of related conjectures. We illustrate our approach with an example.",0
"A Bayesian belief network models a joint distribution with an directed acyclic graph representing dependencies among variables and network parameters characterizing conditional distributions. The parameters are viewed as random variables to quantify uncertainty about their values. Belief nets are used to compute responses to queries; i.e., conditional probabilities of interest. A query is a function of the parameters, hence a random variable. Van Allen et al. (2001, 2008) showed how to quantify uncertainty about a query via a delta method approximation of its variance. We develop more accurate approximations for both query mean and variance. The key idea is to extend the query mean approximation to a ""doubled network"" involving two independent replicates. Our method assumes complete data and can be applied to discrete, continuous, and hybrid networks (provided discrete variables have only discrete parents). We analyze several improvements, and provide empirical studies to demonstrate their effectiveness.",0
"As network attacks have increased in number and severity over the past few years, intrusion detection system (IDS) is increasingly becoming a critical component to secure the network. Due to large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviors, optimizing performance of IDS becomes an important open problem that is receiving more and more attention from the research community. The uncertainty to explore if certain algorithms perform better for certain attack classes constitutes the motivation for the reported herein. In this paper, we evaluate performance of a comprehensive set of classifier algorithms using KDD99 dataset. Based on evaluation results, best algorithms for each attack category is chosen and two classifier algorithm selection models are proposed. The simulation result comparison indicates that noticeable performance improvement and real-time intrusion detection can be achieved as we apply the proposed models to detect different kinds of network attacks.",0
"With the impressive capability to capture visual content, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demon- strated promising performance in various vision-based ap- plications, such as classification, recognition, and objec- t detection. However, due to the intrinsic structure design of CNN, for images with complex content, it achieves lim- ited capability on invariance to translation, rotation, and re-sizing changes, which is strongly emphasized in the s- cenario of content-based image retrieval. In this paper, to address this problem, we proposed a new kernelized deep convolutional neural network. We first discuss our motiva- tion by an experimental study to demonstrate the sensitivi- ty of the global CNN feature to the basic geometric trans- formations. Then, we propose to represent visual content with approximate invariance to the above geometric trans- formations from a kernelized perspective. We extract CNN features on the detected object-like patches and aggregate these patch-level CNN features to form a vectorial repre- sentation with the Fisher vector model. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated on image search application with three benchmark datasets.",0
"In this paper, we propose: (a) a restart schedule for an adaptive simulated annealer, and (b) parallel simulated annealing, with an adaptive and parameter-free annealing schedule. The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states. A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated annealing is almost parameter-free. However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length. We eliminate this parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths. We then extend this restart schedule to parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints. We compare our approach to fixed length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel. Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.",0
"To identify the location of objects of a particular class, a passive computer vision system generally processes all the regions in an image to finally output few regions. However, we can use structure in the scene to search for objects without processing the entire image. We propose a search technique that sequentially processes image regions such that the regions that are more likely to correspond to the query class object are explored earlier. We frame the problem as a Markov decision process and use an imitation learning algorithm to learn a search strategy. Since structure in the scene is essential for search, we work with indoor scene images as they contain both unary scene context information and object-object context in the scene. We perform experiments on the NYU-depth v2 dataset and show that the unary scene context features alone can achieve a significantly high average precision while processing only 20-25\% of the regions for classes like bed and sofa. By considering object-object context along with the scene context features, the performance is further improved for classes like counter, lamp, pillow and sofa.",0
"Finite chase, or alternatively chase termination, is an important condition to ensure the decidability of existential rule languages. In the past few years, a number of rule languages with finite chase have been studied. In this work, we propose a novel approach for classifying the rule languages with finite chase. Using this approach, a family of decidable rule languages, which extend the existing languages with the finite chase property, are naturally defined. We then study the complexity of these languages. Although all of them are tractable for data complexity, we show that their combined complexity can be arbitrarily high. Furthermore, we prove that all the rule languages with finite chase that extend the weakly acyclic language are of the same expressiveness as the weakly acyclic one, while rule languages with higher combined complexity are in general more succinct than those with lower combined complexity.",1
"Knowledge bases are useful resources for many natural language processing tasks, however, they are far from complete. In this paper, we define a novel entity representation as a mixture of its neighborhood in the knowledge base and apply this technique on TransE-a well-known embedding model for knowledge base completion. Experimental results show that the neighborhood information significantly helps to improve the results of the TransE, leading to better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on three benchmark datasets for triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction tasks.",0
"An optimal data partitioning in parallel &amp; distributed implementation of clustering algorithms is a necessary computation as it ensures independent task completion, fair distribution, less number of affected points and better &amp; faster merging. Though partitioning using Kd Tree is being conventionally used in academia, it suffers from performance drenches and bias (non equal distribution) as dimensionality of data increases and hence is not suitable for practical use in industry where dimensionality can be of order of 100s to 1000s. To address these issues we propose two new partitioning techniques using existing mathematical models &amp; study their feasibility, performance (bias and partitioning speed) &amp; possible variants in choosing initial seeds. First method uses an n dimensional hashed grid based approach which is based on mapping the points in space to a set of cubes which hashes the points. Second method uses a tree of voronoi planes where each plane corresponds to a partition. We found that grid based approach was computationally impractical, while using a tree of voronoi planes (using scalable K-Means++ initial seeds) drastically outperformed the Kd-tree tree method as dimensionality increased.",0
"The stochastic shortest path problem (SSP) is a highly expressive model for probabilistic planning. The computational hardness of SSPs has sparked interest in determinization-based planners that can quickly solve large problems. However, existing methods employ a simplistic approach to determinization. In particular, they ignore the possibility of tailoring the determinization to the specific characteristics of the target domain. In this work we examine this question, by showing that learning a good determinization for a planning domain can be done efficiently and can improve performance. Moreover, we show how to directly incorporate probabilistic reasoning into the planning problem when a good determinization is not sufficient by itself. Based on these insights, we introduce a planner, FF-LAO*, that outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic planners on several well-known competition benchmarks.",0
"We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with a set of target states and positive integer costs associated with every transition. The traditional optimization objective (stochastic shortest path) asks to minimize the expected total cost until the target set is reached. We extend the traditional framework of POMDPs to model energy consumption, which represents a hard constraint. The energy levels may increase and decrease with transitions, and the hard constraint requires that the energy level must remain positive in all steps till the target is reached. First, we present a novel algorithm for solving POMDPs with energy levels, developing on existing POMDP solvers and using RTDP as its main method. Our second contribution is related to policy representation. For larger POMDP instances the policies computed by existing solvers are too large to be understandable. We present an automated procedure based on machine learning techniques that automatically extracts important decisions of the policy allowing us to compute succinct human readable policies. Finally, we show experimentally that our algorithm performs well and computes succinct policies on a number of POMDP instances from the literature that were naturally enhanced with energy levels.",0
"Smoothed analysis is a framework for analyzing the complexity of an algorithm, acting as a bridge between average and worst-case behaviour. For example, Quicksort and the Simplex algorithm are widely used in practical applications, despite their heavy worst-case complexity. Smoothed complexity aims to better characterize such algorithms. Existing theoretical bounds for the smoothed complexity of sorting algorithms are still quite weak. Furthermore, empirically computing the smoothed complexity via its original definition is computationally infeasible, even for modest input sizes. In this paper, we focus on accurately predicting the smoothed complexity of sorting algorithms, using machine learning techniques. We propose two regression models that take into account various properties of sorting algorithms and some of the known theoretical results in smoothed analysis to improve prediction quality. We show experimental results for predicting the smoothed complexity of Quicksort, Mergesort, and optimized Bubblesort for large input sizes, therefore filling the gap between known theoretical and empirical results.",0
"Methods of applying neural networks to control plants are considered. Methods and schemes are described, their advantages and disadvantages are discussed.",0
"This work presents a multiscale framework to solve an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem for continuous-time/state stochastic systems. We take advantage of a diffusion wavelet representation of the associated Markov chain to abstract the state space. This not only allows for effectively handling the large (and geometrically complex) decision space but also provides more interpretable representations of the demonstrated state trajectories and also of the resulting policy of IRL. In the proposed framework, the problem is divided into the global and local IRL, where the global approximation of the optimal value functions are obtained using coarse features and the local details are quantified using fine local features. An illustrative numerical example on robot path control in a complex environment is presented to verify the proposed method.",0
"The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental applications, such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes, motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage. Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop eSIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-field for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.",0

"Traditional AI reasoning techniques have been used successfully in many domains, including logistics, scheduling and game playing. This paper is part of a project aimed at investigating how such techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments. Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate---and communication actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among distributed agents as a given. We address this challenge by developing an agent architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). ASP has been chosen for this task because it enables high flexibility of representation, both of knowledge and of reasoning tasks. Although ASP has been used successfully in a number of applications, and ASP-based architectures have been studied for about a decade, to the best of our knowledge this is the first practical application of a complete ASP-based agent architecture. It is also the first practical application of ASP involving a combination of centralized reasoning, decentralized reasoning, execution monitoring, and reasoning about network communications. This work has been empirically validated using a distributed network-centric software evaluation testbed and the results provide guidance to designers in how to understand and control intelligent systems that operate in these environments.",0
"The Tawny-OWL library provides a fully-programmatic environment for ontology building; it enables the use of a rich set of tools for ontology development, by recasting development as a form of programming. It is built in Clojure - a modern Lisp dialect, and is backed by the OWL API. Used simply, it has a similar syntax to OWL Manchester syntax, but it provides arbitrary extensibility and abstraction. It builds on existing facilities for Clojure, which provides a rich and modern programming tool chain, for versioning, distributed development, build, testing and continuous integration. In this paper, we describe the library, this environment and the its potential implications for the ontology development process.",0
"We present and examine a result related to uncertainty reasoning, namely that a certain plausibility space of Cox's type can be uniquely embedded in a minimal ordered field. This, although a purely mathematical result, can be claimed to imply that every rational method to reason with uncertainty must be based on sets of extended probability distributions, where extended probability is standard probability extended with infinitesimals.",0
Social abstract argumentation is a principled way to assign values to conflicting (weighted) arguments. In this note we discuss the important property of the uniqueness of the model.,0
"Traditional fact checking by experts and analysts cannot keep pace with the volume of newly created information. It is important and necessary, therefore, to enhance our ability to computationally determine whether some statement of fact is true or false. We view this problem as a link-prediction task in a knowledge graph, and show that a new model of the top discriminative predicate paths is able to understand the meaning of some statement and accurately determine its veracity. We evaluate our approach by examining thousands of claims related to history, geography, biology, and politics using a public, million node knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and PubMedDB. Not only does our approach significantly outperform related models, we also find that the discriminative predicate path model is easily interpretable and provides sensible reasons for the final determination.",0
"The subpath planning problem is a branch of the path planning problem, which has widespread applications in automated manufacturing process as well as vehicle and robot navigation. This problem is to find the shortest path or tour subject for travelling a set of given subpaths. The current approaches for dealing with the subpath planning problem are all based on meta-heuristic approaches. It is well-known that meta-heuristic based approaches have several deficiencies. To address them, we propose a novel approximation algorithm in the O(n^3) time complexity class, which guarantees to solve any subpath planning problem instance with the fixed ratio bound of 2. Also, the formal proofs of the claims, our empirical evaluation shows that our approximation method acts much better than a state-of-the-art method, both in result and execution time.",0
"A complex system is made up of many components with many interactions. So the design of systems such as simulation systems, cooperative systems or assistance systems includes a very accurate modelling of interactional and communicational levels. The agent-based approach provides an adapted abstraction level for this problem. After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in ""cognitive engineering"". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective). To complete the description of multi-level agent models, which is the focus of this paper, we illustrate our modelling and discuss our ongoing work on each level.",0
"An important issue in the use of expert systems is the so-called brittleness problem. Expert systems model only a limited part of the world. While the explicit management of uncertainty in expert systems itigates the brittleness problem, it is still possible for a system to be used, unwittingly, in ways that the system is not prepared to address. Such a situation may be detected by the method of straw models, first presented by Jensen et al. [1990] and later generalized and justified by Laskey [1991]. We describe an algorithm, which we have implemented, that takes as input an annotated diagnostic Bayesian network (the base model) and constructs, without assistance, a bipartite network to be used as a straw model. We show that in some cases this straw model is better that the independent straw model of Jensen et al., the only other straw model for which a construction algorithm has been designed and implemented.",0
"We model coherent conversation continuation via RNN-based dialogue models equipped with a dynamic attention mechanism. Our attention-RNN language model dynamically increases the scope of attention on the history as the conversation continues, as opposed to standard attention (or alignment) models with a fixed input scope in a sequence-to-sequence model. This allows each generated word to be associated with the most relevant words in its corresponding conversation history. We evaluate the model on two popular dialogue datasets, the open-domain MovieTriples dataset and the closed-domain Ubuntu Troubleshoot dataset, and achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art and baselines on several metrics, including complementary diversity-based metrics, human evaluation, and qualitative visualizations. We also show that a vanilla RNN with dynamic attention outperforms more complex memory models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) by allowing for flexible, long-distance memory. We promote further coherence via topic modeling-based reranking.",1
"Biological neural networks are systems of extraordinary computational capabilities shaped by evolution, development, and lifetime learning. The interplay of these elements leads to the emergence of adaptive behavior and intelligence, but the complexity of the whole system of interactions is an obstacle to the understanding of the key factors at play. Inspired by such intricate natural phenomena, Evolved Plastic Artificial Neural Networks (EPANNs) use simulated evolution in-silico to breed plastic neural networks, artificial systems composed of sensors, outputs, and plastic components that change in response to sensory-output experiences in an environment. These systems may reveal key algorithmic ingredients of adaptation, autonomously discover novel adaptive algorithms, and lead to hypotheses on the emergence of biological adaptation. EPANNs have seen considerable progress over the last two decades. Current scientific and technological advances in artificial neural networks are now setting the conditions for radically new approaches and results. In particular, the limitations of hand-designed structures and algorithms currently used in most deep neural networks could be overcome by more flexible and innovative solutions. This paper brings together a variety of inspiring ideas that define the field of EPANNs. The main computational methods and results are reviewed. Finally, new opportunities and developments are presented.",0
"The state-of-the-art online learning approaches is only capable of learning the metric for predefined tasks. In this paper, we consider lifelong learning problem to mimic ""human learning"", i.e., endow a new capability to the learned metric for a new task from new online samples and incorporating previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, we propose a new framework: lifelong metric learning (LML), which only utilizes the data of the new task to train the metric model while preserving the original capabilities. More specifically, the proposed LML maintains a common subspace for all learned metrics, named lifelong dictionary, transfers knowledge from the common subspace to each new metric task with task-specific idiosyncrasy, and redefines the common subspace over time to maximize performance across all metric tasks. We apply online Passive Aggressive optimization to solve the proposed LML framework. Finally, we evaluate our approach by analyzing several multi-task metric learning datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",0
"Clause Learning is one of the most important components of a conflict driven clause learning (CDCL) SAT solver that is effective on industrial instances. Since the number of learned clauses is proved to be exponential in the worse case, it is necessary to identify the most relevant clauses to maintain and delete the irrelevant ones. As reported in the literature, several learned clauses deletion strategies have been proposed. However the diversity in both the number of clauses to be removed at each step of reduction and the results obtained with each strategy creates confusion to determine which criterion is better. Thus, the problem to select which learned clauses are to be removed during the search step remains very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify the most relevant learned clauses without favoring or excluding any of the proposed measures, but by adopting the notion of dominance relationship among those measures. Our approach bypasses the problem of the diversity of results and reaches a compromise between the assessments of these measures. Furthermore, the proposed approach also avoids another non-trivial problem which is the amount of clauses to be deleted at each reduction of the learned clause database.",0
"Causality is a non-obvious concept that is often considered to be related to temporality. In this paper we present a number of past and present approaches to the definition of temporality and causality from philosophical, physical, and computational points of view. We note that time is an important ingredient in many relationships and phenomena. The topic is then divided into the two main areas of temporal discovery, which is concerned with finding relations that are stretched over time, and causal discovery, where a claim is made as to the causal influence of certain events on others. We present a number of computational tools used for attempting to automatically discover temporal and causal relations in data.",0
"Multiagent planning and coordination problems are common and known to be computationally hard. We show that a wide range of two-agent problems can be formulated as bilinear programs. We present a successive approximation algorithm that significantly outperforms the coverage set algorithm, which is the state-of-the-art method for this class of multiagent problems. Because the algorithm is formulated for bilinear programs, it is more general and simpler to implement. The new algorithm can be terminated at any time and-unlike the coverage set algorithm-it facilitates the derivation of a useful online performance bound. It is also much more efficient, on average reducing the computation time of the optimal solution by about four orders of magnitude. Finally, we introduce an automatic dimensionality reduction method that improves the effectiveness of the algorithm, extending its applicability to new domains and providing a new way to analyze a subclass of bilinear programs.",0
"In many tasks related to reasoning about consequences of a logical theory, it is desirable to decompose the theory into a number of weakly-related or independent components. However, a theory may represent knowledge that is subject to change, as a result of executing actions that have effects on some of the initial properties mentioned in the theory. Having once computed a decomposition of a theory, it is advantageous to know whether a decomposition has to be computed again in the newly-changed theory (obtained from taking into account changes resulting from execution of an action). In the paper, we address this problem in the scope of the situation calculus, where a change of an initial theory is related to the notion of progression. Progression provides a form of forward reasoning; it relies on forgetting values of those properties, which are subject to change, and computing new values for them. We consider decomposability and inseparability, two component properties known from the literature, and contribute by 1) studying the conditions when these properties are preserved and 2) when they are lost wrt progression and the related operation of forgetting. To show the latter, we demonstrate the boundaries using a number of negative examples. To show the former, we identify cases when these properties are preserved under forgetting and progression of initial theories in local-effect basic action theories of the situation calculus. Our paper contributes to bridging two different communities in Knowledge Representation, namely research on modularity and research on reasoning about actions.",0
"This article first lists reasons why - in the long term or when creating a new knowledge base (KB) for general knowledge sharing purposes - collaboratively building a well-organized KB does/can provide more possibilities, with on the whole no more costs, than the mainstream approach where knowledge creation and re-use involves searching, merging and creating (semi-)independent (relatively small) ontologies or semi-formal documents. The article lists elements required to achieve this and describes the main one: a KB editing protocol that keeps the KB free of automatically/manually detected inconsistencies while not forcing them to discuss or agree on terminology and beliefs nor requiring a selection committee.",0
"We investigate an experiential learning paradigm for acquiring an internal model of intuitive physics. Our model is evaluated on a real-world robotic manipulation task that requires displacing objects to target locations by poking. The robot gathered over 400 hours of experience by executing more than 50K pokes on different objects. We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels. Our experiments show that this joint modeling approach outperforms alternative methods. We also demonstrate that active data collection using the learned model further improves performance.",1
"We approach structured output prediction by learning a deep value network (DVN) that evaluates different output structures for a given input. For example, when applied to image segmentation, the value network takes an image and a segmentation mask as inputs and predicts a scalar score evaluating the mask quality and its correspondence with the image. Once the value network is optimized, at inference, it finds output structures that maximize the score of the value net via gradient descent on continuous relaxations of structured outputs. Thus DVN takes advantage of the joint modeling of the inputs and outputs. Our framework applies to a wide range of structured output prediction problems. We conduct experiments on multi-label classification based on text data and on image segmentation problems. DVN outperforms several strong baselines and the state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks. In addition, on image segmentation, the proposed deep value network learns complex shape priors and effectively combines image information with the prior to obtain competitive segmentation results.",1
"Number of web services available on Internet and its usage are increasing very fast. In many cases, one service is not enough to complete the business requirement; composition of web services is carried out. Autonomous composition of web services to achieve new functionality is generating considerable attention in semantic web domain. Development time and effort for new applications can be reduced with service composition. Various approaches to carry out automated composition of web services are discussed in literature. Web service composition using ontologies is one of the effective approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how the ontology based composition can be made faster for each customer. We propose a framework to provide precomposed web services to fulfil user requirements. We detail how ontology merging can be used for composition which expedites the whole process. We discuss how framework provides customer specific ontology merging and repository. We also elaborate on how merging of ontologies is carried out.",0
"In some domestic professional sports leagues, the home stadiums are located in cities connected by a common train line running in one direction. For these instances, we can incorporate this geographical information to determine optimal or nearly-optimal solutions to the n-team Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP), an NP-hard sports scheduling problem whose solution is a double round-robin tournament schedule that minimizes the sum total of distances traveled by all n teams. We introduce the Linear Distance Traveling Tournament Problem (LD-TTP), and solve it for n=4 and n=6, generating the complete set of possible solutions through elementary combinatorial techniques. For larger n, we propose a novel ""expander construction"" that generates an approximate solution to the LD-TTP. For n congruent to 4 modulo 6, we show that our expander construction produces a feasible double round-robin tournament schedule whose total distance is guaranteed to be no worse than 4/3 times the optimal solution, regardless of where the n teams are located. This 4/3-approximation for the LD-TTP is stronger than the currently best-known ratio of 5/3 + epsilon for the general TTP. We conclude the paper by applying this linear distance relaxation to general (non-linear) n-team TTP instances, where we develop fast approximate solutions by simply ""assuming"" the n teams lie on a straight line and solving the modified problem. We show that this technique surprisingly generates the distance-optimal tournament on all benchmark sets on 6 teams, as well as close-to-optimal schedules for larger n, even when the teams are located around a circle or positioned in three-dimensional space.",0
"My research goal is to employ a parser generation algorithm based on the Earley parsing algorithm to the evaluation and compilation of queries to logic programs, especially to deductive databases. By means of partial deduction, from a query to a logic program a parameterized automaton is to be generated that models the evaluation of this query. This automaton can be compiled to executable code; thus we expect a speedup in runtime of query evaluation.

"This paper develops the idea of membership function assignment for OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology elements in order to subsequently generate fuzzy rules from this ontology. The task of membership function assignment for OWL ontology elements had already been partially described, but this concerned the case, when several OWL ontologies of the same domain were available, and they were merged into a single ontology. The purpose of this paper is to present the way of membership function assignment for OWL ontology elements in the case, when there is the only one available ontology. Fuzzy rules, generated from the OWL ontology, are necessary for supplement of the SWES (Semantic Web Expert System) knowledge base. SWES is an expert system, which will be able to extract knowledge from OWL ontologies, found in the Web, and will serve as a universal expert for the user.",0
This paper proposes a method to estimate the total time required to solve SAT in distributed environments via partitioning approach. It is based on the observation that for some simple forms of problem partitioning one can use the Monte Carlo approach to estimate the time required to solve an original problem. The method proposed is based on an algorithm for searching for partitioning with an optimal solving time estimation. We applied this method to estimate the time required to perform logical cryptanalysis of the widely known stream ciphers A5/1 and Bivium. The paper also describes a volunteer computing project SAT@home aimed at solving hard combinatorial problems reduced to SAT. In this project during several months there were solved 10 problems of logical cryptanalysis of the A5/1 cipher thatcould not be solved using known rainbow tables.,0

"Recent works have highlighted scale invariance or symmetry present in the weight space of a typical deep network and the adverse effect it has on the Euclidean gradient based stochastic gradient descent optimization. In this work, we show that a commonly used deep network, which uses convolution, batch normalization, reLU, max-pooling, and sub-sampling pipeline, possess more complex forms of symmetry arising from scaling-based reparameterization of the network weights. We propose to tackle the issue of the weight space symmetry by constraining the filters to lie on the unit-norm manifold. Consequently, training the network boils down to using stochastic gradient descent updates on the unit-norm manifold. Our empirical evidence based on the MNIST dataset shows that the proposed updates improve the test performance beyond what is achieved with batch normalization and without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the weight updates.",0
"Recently, triggered by the impressive results in TV-games or game of Go by Google DeepMind, end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) is collecting attentions.

In this paper, they are introduced again at this timing.",0
"For many voting rules, it is NP-hard to compute a successful manipulation. However, NP-hardness only bounds the worst-case complexity. Recent theoretical results suggest that manipulation may often be easy in practice. We study empirically the cost of manipulating the single transferable vote (STV) rule. This was one of the first rules shown to be NP-hard to manipulate. It also appears to be one of the harder rules to manipulate since it involves multiple rounds and since, unlike many other rules, it is NP-hard for a single agent to manipulate without weights on the votes or uncertainty about how the other agents have voted. In almost every election in our experiments, it was easy to compute how a single agent could manipulate the election or to prove that manipulation by a single agent was impossible. It remains an interesting open question if manipulation by a coalition of agents is hard to compute in practice.",0
"This paper targets on the problem of set to set recognition, which learns the metric between two image sets. Images in each set belong to the same identity. Since images in a set can be complementary, they hopefully lead to higher accuracy in practical applications. However, the quality of each sample cannot be guaranteed, and samples with poor quality will hurt the metric. In this paper, the quality aware network (QAN) is proposed to confront this problem, where the quality of each sample can be automatically learned although such information is not explicitly provided in the training stage. The network has two branches, where the first branch extracts appearance feature embedding for each sample and the other branch predicts quality score for each sample. Features and quality scores of all samples in a set are then aggregated to generate the final feature embedding. We show that the two branches can be trained in an end-to-end manner given only the set-level identity annotation. Analysis on gradient spread of this mechanism indicates that the quality learned by the network is beneficial to set-to-set recognition and simplifies the distribution that the network needs to fit. Experiments on both face verification and person re-identification show advantages of the proposed QAN. The source code and network structure can be downloaded at",0
"There is overwhelming evidence that human intelligence is a product of Darwinian evolution. Investigating the consequences of self-modification, and more precisely, the consequences of utility function self-modification, leads to the stronger claim that not only human, but any form of intelligence is ultimately only possible within evolutionary processes. Human-designed artificial intelligences can only remain stable until they discover how to manipulate their own utility function. By definition, a human designer cannot prevent a superhuman intelligence from modifying itself, even if protection mechanisms against this action are put in place. Without evolutionary pressure, sufficiently advanced artificial intelligences become inert by simplifying their own utility function. Within evolutionary processes, the implicit utility function is always reducible to persistence, and the control of superhuman intelligences embedded in evolutionary processes is not possible. Mechanisms against utility function self-modification are ultimately futile. Instead, scientific effort toward the mitigation of existential risks from the development of superintelligences should be in two directions: understanding consciousness, and the complex dynamics of evolutionary systems.",0

"We present in this paper an efficient approach for acoustic scene classification by exploring the structure of class labels. Given a set of class labels, a category taxonomy is automatically learned by collectively optimizing a clustering of the labels into multiple meta-classes in a tree structure. An acoustic scene instance is then embedded into a low-dimensional feature representation which consists of the likelihoods that it belongs to the meta-classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on two different datasets for the acoustic scene classification task, including the DCASE 2013 and LITIS Rouen datasets.",0
"Deviations from rational decision-making due to limited computational resources have been studied in the field of bounded rationality, originally proposed by Herbert Simon. There have been a number of different approaches to model bounded rationality ranging from optimality principles to heuristics. Here we take an information-theoretic approach to bounded rationality, where information-processing costs are measured by the relative entropy between a posterior decision strategy and a given fixed prior strategy. In the case of multiple environments, it can be shown that there is an optimal prior rendering the bounded rationality problem equivalent to the rate distortion problem for lossy compression in information theory. Accordingly, the optimal prior and posterior strategies can be computed by the well-known Blahut-Arimoto algorithm which requires the computation of partition sums over all possible outcomes and cannot be applied straightforwardly to continuous problems. Here we derive a sampling-based alternative update rule for the adaptation of prior behaviors of decision-makers and we show convergence to the optimal prior predicted by rate distortion theory. Importantly, the update rule avoids typical infeasible operations such as the computation of partition sums. We show in simulations a proof of concept for discrete action and environment domains. This approach is not only interesting as a generic computational method, but might also provide a more realistic model of human decision-making processes occurring on a fast and a slow time scale.",0

The competition will debut at the IEEE Computational Intelligence and Games Conference 2016. Some preliminary results showing the effects of Partial Observability and the benefits of simple communication are also presented.",0
"We address the cost-sensitive feature acquisition problem, where misclassifying an instance is costly but the expected misclassification cost can be reduced by acquiring the values of the missing features. Because acquiring the features is costly as well, the objective is to acquire the right set of features so that the sum of the feature acquisition cost and misclassification cost is minimized. We describe the Value of Information Lattice (VOILA), an optimal and efficient feature subset acquisition framework. Unlike the common practice, which is to acquire features greedily, VOILA can reason with subsets of features. VOILA efficiently searches the space of possible feature subsets by discovering and exploiting conditional independence properties between the features and it reuses probabilistic inference computations to further speed up the process. Through empirical evaluation on five medical datasets, we show that the greedy strategy is often reluctant to acquire features, as it cannot forecast the benefit of acquiring multiple features in combination.",0
"Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is an interesting and promising approach to testing human abilities. In our research we use Bayesian networks to create a model of tested humans. We collected data from paper tests performed with grammar school students. In this article we first provide the summary of data used for our experiments. We propose several different Bayesian networks, which we tested and compared by cross-validation. Interesting results were obtained and are discussed in the paper. The analysis has brought a clearer view on the model selection problem. Future research is outlined in the concluding part of the paper.",0
"In this work we propose a multi-valued extension of logic programs under the stable models semantics where each true atom in a model is associated with a set of justifications, in a similar spirit than a set of proof trees. The main contribution of this paper is that we capture justifications into an algebra of truth values with three internal operations: an addition '+' representing alternative justifications for a formula, a commutative product '*' representing joint interaction of causes and a non-commutative product '.' acting as a concatenation or proof constructor. Using this multi-valued semantics, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the syntactic proof tree of a standard (non-causal) logic program and the interpretation of each true atom in a model. Furthermore, thanks to this algebraic characterization we can detect semantic properties like redundancy and relevance of the obtained justifications. We also identify a lattice-based characterization of this algebra, defining a direct consequences operator, proving its continuity and that its least fix point can be computed after a finite number of iterations. Finally, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz's program reduct.",0
"The amount of information available on the Web grows at an incredible high rate. Systems and procedures devised to extract these data from Web sources already exist, and different approaches and techniques have been investigated during the last years. On the one hand, reliable solutions should provide robust algorithms of Web data mining which could automatically face possible malfunctioning or failures. On the other, in literature there is a lack of solutions about the maintenance of these systems. Procedures that extract Web data may be strictly interconnected with the structure of the data source itself; thus, malfunctioning or acquisition of corrupted data could be caused, for example, by structural modifications of data sources brought by their owners. Nowadays, verification of data integrity and maintenance are mostly manually managed, in order to ensure that these systems work correctly and reliably. In this paper we propose a novel approach to create procedures able to extract data from Web sources -- the so called Web wrappers -- which can face possible malfunctioning caused by modifications of the structure of the data source, and can automatically repair themselves.",0
"This paper presents a new algorithm for online linear regression whose efficiency guarantees satisfy the requirements of the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) framework. The algorithm improves on the complexity bounds of the current state-of-the-art procedure in this setting. We explore several applications of this algorithm for learning compact reinforcement-learning representations. We show that KWIK linear regression can be used to learn the reward function of a factored MDP and the probabilities of action outcomes in Stochastic STRIPS and Object Oriented MDPs, none of which have been proven to be efficiently learnable in the RL setting before. We also combine KWIK linear regression with other KWIK learners to learn larger portions of these models, including experiments on learning factored MDP transition and reward functions together.",0
"We prove that it is NP-hard for a coalition of two manipulators to compute how to manipulate the Borda voting rule. This resolves one of the last open problems in the computational complexity of manipulating common voting rules. Because of this NP-hardness, we treat computing a manipulation as an approximation problem where we try to minimize the number of manipulators. Based on ideas from bin packing and multiprocessor scheduling, we propose two new approximation methods to compute manipulations of the Borda rule. Experiments show that these methods significantly outperform the previous best known %existing approximation method. We are able to find optimal manipulations in almost all the randomly generated elections tested. Our results suggest that, whilst computing a manipulation of the Borda rule by a coalition is NP-hard, computational complexity may provide only a weak barrier against manipulation in practice.",1
"As mobile devices have become indispensable in modern life, mobile security is becoming much more important. Traditional password or PIN-like point-of-entry security measures score low on usability and are vulnerable to brute force and other types of attacks. In order to improve mobile security, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system(ANFIS)-based implicit authentication system is proposed in this paper to provide authentication in a continuous and transparent manner.To illustrate the applicability and capability of ANFIS in our implicit authentication system, experiments were conducted on behavioural data collected for up to 12 weeks from different Android users. The ability of the ANFIS-based system to detect an adversary is also tested with scenarios involving an attacker with varying levels of knowledge. The results demonstrate that ANFIS is a feasible and efficient approach for implicit authentication with an average of 95% user recognition rate. Moreover, the use of ANFIS-based system for implicit authentication significantly reduces manual tuning and configuration tasks due to its selflearning capability.",0
"In the literature on graphical models, there has been increased attention paid to the problems of learning hidden structure (see Heckerman [H96] for survey) and causal mechanisms from sample data [H96, P88, S93, P95, F98]. In most settings we should expect the former to be difficult, and the latter potentially impossible without experimental intervention. In this work, we examine some restricted settings in which perfectly reconstruct the hidden structure solely on the basis of observed sample data.",0

"Vehicle Routing Problem is a well-known problem in logistics and transportation, and the variety of such problems is explained by the fact that it occurs in many real-life situations. It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and finding an exact optimal solution is practically impossible. In this work, Site-Dependent Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with hard and soft Time Windows and Split Deliveries is considered (SDTTRPTWSD).

A greedy heuristic is applied to construct an initial solution.",0
"Hierarchical problem abstraction, when applicable, may offer exponential reductions in computational complexity. Previous work on coarse-to-fine dynamic programming (CFDP) has demonstrated this possibility using state abstraction to speed up the Viterbi algorithm. In this paper, we show how to apply temporal abstraction to the Viterbi problem. Our algorithm uses bounds derived from analysis of coarse timescales to prune large parts of the state trellis at finer timescales. We demonstrate improvements of several orders of magnitude over the standard Viterbi algorithm, as well as significant speedups over CFDP, for problems whose state variables evolve at widely differing rates.",0
"Constrained sampling and counting are two fundamental problems in artificial intelligence with a diverse range of applications, spanning probabilistic reasoning and planning to constrained-random verification. While the theory of these problems was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did not scale to industrial size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. Recently, we proposed a novel approach that combines universal hashing and SAT solving and scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees. This paper provides an overview of the key ingredients of the approach and discusses challenges that need to be overcome to handle larger real-world instances.",0

The interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent. Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a strong baseline for entity extraction.",1
"Contextual bandits are widely used in Internet services from news recommendation to advertising. Generalized linear models (logistical regression in particular) have demonstrated stronger performance than linear models in many applications. However, most theoretical analyses on contextual bandits so far are on linear bandits. In this work, we propose an upper confidence bound based algorithm for generalized linear contextual bandits, which achieves an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT})$ regret over $T$ rounds with $d$ dimensional feature vectors. This regret matches the minimax lower bound, up to logarithmic terms, and improves on the best previous result by a $\sqrt{d}$ factor, assuming the number of arms is fixed. A key component in our analysis is to establish a new, sharp finite-sample confidence bound for maximum-likelihood estimates in generalized linear models, which may be of independent interest. We also analyze a simpler upper confidence bound algorithm, which is useful in practice, and prove it to have optimal regret for the certain cases.",1
"The stable model (SM) semantics lacks the properties of existence, relevance and cumulativity. If we prospectively consider the class of conservative extensions of SM semantics (i.e., semantics that for each normal logic program P retrieve a superset of the set of stable models of P), one may wander how do the semantics of this class behave in what concerns the aforementioned properties. That is the type of issue dealt with in this paper. We define a large class of conservative extensions of the SM semantics, dubbed affix stable model semantics, ASM, and study the above referred properties into two non-disjoint subfamilies of the class ASM, here dubbed ASMh and ASMm. From this study a number of results stem which facilitate the assessment of semantics in the class ASMh U ASMm with respect to the properties of existence, relevance and cumulativity, whilst unveiling relations among these properties. As a result of the approach taken in our work, light is shed on the characterization of the SM semantics, as we show that the properties of (lack of) existence and (lack of) cautious monotony are equivalent, which opposes statements on this issue that may be found in the literature; we also characterize the relevance failure of SM semantics in a more clear way than usually stated in the literature.",0
"At last year?s Uncertainty in AI Conference, we reported the results of a sensitivity analysis study of Pathfinder. Our findings were quite unexpected-slight variations to Pathfinder?s parameters appeared to lead to substantial degradations in system performance. A careful look at our first analysis, together with the valuable feedback provided by the participants of last year?s conference, led us to conduct a follow-up study. Our follow-up differs from our initial study in two ways: (i) the probabilities 0.0 and 1.0 remained unchanged, and (ii) the variations to the probabilities that are close to both ends (0.0 or 1.0) were less than the ones close to the middle (0.5). The results of the follow-up study look more reasonable-slight variations to Pathfinder?s parameters now have little effect on its performance. Taken together, these two sets of results suggest a viable extension of a common decision analytic sensitivity analysis to the larger, more complex settings generally encountered in artificial intelligence.",0
"Many multi-agent coordination problems can be represented as DCOPs. Motivated by task allocation in disaster response, we extend standard DCOP models to consider uncertain task rewards where the outcome of completing a task depends on its current state, which is randomly drawn from unknown distributions. The goal of solving this problem is to find a solution for all agents that minimizes the overall worst-case loss. This is a challenging problem for centralized algorithms because the search space grows exponentially with the number of agents and is nontrivial for standard DCOP algorithms we have. To address this, we propose a novel decentralized algorithm that incorporates Max-Sum with iterative constraint generation to solve the problem by passing messages among agents. By so doing, our approach scales well and can solve instances of the task allocation problem with hundreds of agents and tasks.",1
"In this paper, we propose a comprehensive study of second-order consistencies (i.e., consistencies identifying inconsistent pairs of values) for constraint satisfaction. We build a full picture of the relationships existing between four basic second-order consistencies, namely path consistency (PC), 3-consistency (3C), dual consistency (DC) and 2-singleton arc consistency (2SAC), as well as their conservative and strong variants. Interestingly, dual consistency is an original property that can be established by using the outcome of the enforcement of generalized arc consistency (GAC), which makes it rather easy to obtain since constraint solvers typically maintain GAC during search. On binary constraint networks, DC is equivalent to PC, but its restriction to existing constraints, called conservative dual consistency (CDC), is strictly stronger than traditional conservative consistencies derived from path consistency, namely partial path consistency (PPC) and conservative path consistency (CPC). After introducing a general algorithm to enforce strong (C)DC, we present the results of an experimentation over a wide range of benchmarks that demonstrate the interest of (conservative) dual consistency. In particular, we show that enforcing (C)DC before search clearly improves the performance of MAC (the algorithm that maintains GAC during search) on several binary and non-binary structured problems.",0
"Techniques for plan recognition under uncertainty require a stochastic model of the plan-generation process. We introduce Probabilistic State-Dependent Grammars (PSDGs) to represent an agent's plan-generation process. The PSDG language model extends probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) by allowing production probabilities to depend on an explicit model of the planning agent's internal and external state. Given a PSDG description of the plan-generation process, we can then use inference algorithms that exploit the particular independence properties of the PSDG language to efficiently answer plan-recognition queries. The combination of the PSDG language model and inference algorithms extends the range of plan-recognition domains for which practical probabilistic inference is possible, as illustrated by applications in traffic monitoring and air combat.",0
"In the data mining field many clustering methods have been proposed, yet standard versions do not take into account uncertain databases. This paper deals with a new approach to cluster uncertain data by using a hierarchical clustering defined within the belief function framework. The main objective of the belief hierarchical clustering is to allow an object to belong to one or several clusters. To each belonging, a degree of belief is associated, and clusters are combined based on the pignistic properties. Experiments with real uncertain data show that our proposed method can be considered as a propitious tool.",0
"We study a subclass of POMDPs, called Deterministic POMDPs, that is characterized by deterministic actions and observations. These models do not provide the same generality of POMDPs yet they capture a number of interesting and challenging problems, and permit more efficient algorithms. Indeed, some of the recent work in planning is built around such assumptions mainly by the quest of amenable models more expressive than the classical deterministic models. We provide results about the fundamental properties of Deterministic POMDPs, their relation with AND/OR search problems and algorithms, and their computational complexity.",0
"Humans can ground natural language commands to tasks at both abstract and fine-grained levels of specificity. For instance, a human forklift operator can be instructed to perform a high-level action, like ""grab a pallet"" or a lowlevel action like ""tilt back a little bit."" While robots are also capable of grounding language commands to tasks, previous methods implicitly assume that all commands and tasks reside at a single, fixed level of abstraction. Additionally, those approaches that do not use abstraction experience inefficient planning and execution times due to the large, intractable state-action spaces, which closely resemble real world complexity. In this work, by grounding commands to all the tasks or subtasks available in a hierarchical planning framework, we arrive at a model capable of interpreting language at multiple levels of specificity ranging from coarse to more granular. We show that the accuracy of the grounding procedure is improved when simultaneously inferring the degree of abstraction in language used to communicate the task. Leveraging hierarchy also improves efficiency: our proposed approach enables a robot to respond to a command within one second on 90% of our tasks, while baselines take over twenty seconds on half the tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that a real, physical robot can ground commands at multiple levels of abstraction allowing it to efficiently plan different subtasks within the same planning hierarchy.",0
"Many known planning tasks have inherent constraints concerning the best order in which to achieve the goals. A number of research efforts have been made to detect such constraints and to use them for guiding search, in the hope of speeding up the planning process. We go beyond the previous approaches by considering ordering constraints not only over the (top-level) goals, but also over the sub-goals that will necessarily arise during planning. Landmarks are facts that must be true at some point in every valid solution plan. We extend Koehler and Hoffmann's definition of reasonable orders between top level goals to the more general case of landmarks. We show how landmarks can be found, how their reasonable orders can be approximated, and how this information can be used to decompose a given planning task into several smaller sub-tasks. Our methodology is completely domain- and planner-independent. The implementation demonstrates that the approach can yield significant runtime performance improvements when used as a control loop around state-of-the-art sub-optimal planning systems, as exemplified by FF and LPG.",0
"The systematic modelling of dynamic spatial systems is a key requirement in a wide range of application areas such as commonsense cognitive robotics, computer-aided architecture design, dynamic geographic information systems.

"The debts' clearing problem is about clearing all the debts in a group of n entities (persons, companies etc.) using a minimal number of money transaction operations.

An evolutionary algorithm for solving the debts' clearing problem is proposed.",0
"Variation in language is ubiquitous, and is particularly evident in newer forms of writing such as social media. Fortunately, variation is not random, but is usually linked to social factors. By exploiting linguistic homophily --- the tendency of socially linked individuals to use language similarly --- it is possible to build models that are more robust to variation. In this paper, we focus on social network communities, which make it possible to generalize sociolinguistic properties from authors in the training set to authors in the test sets, without requiring demographic author metadata. We detect communities via standard graph clustering algorithms, and then exploit these communities by learning community-specific projections of word embeddings. These projections capture shifts in word meaning in different social groups; by modeling them, we are able to improve the overall accuracy of Twitter sentiment analysis by a significant margin over competitive prior work.",1

"In building Bayesian belief networks, the elicitation of all probabilities required can be a major obstacle. We learned the extent of this often-cited observation in the construction of the probabilistic part of a complex influence diagram in the field of cancer treatment. Based upon our negative experiences with existing methods, we designed a new method for probability elicitation from domain experts. The method combines various ideas, among which are the ideas of transcribing probabilities and of using a scale with both numerical and verbal anchors for marking assessments. In the construction of the probabilistic part of our influence diagram, the method proved to allow for the elicitation of many probabilities in little time.",0
"Software cost estimation is one of the prerequisite managerial activities carried out at the software development initiation stages and also repeated throughout the whole software life-cycle so that amendments to the total cost are made. In software cost estimation typically, a selection of project attributes is employed to produce effort estimations of the expected human resources to deliver a software product. However, choosing the appropriate project cost drivers in each case requires a lot of experience and knowledge on behalf of the project manager which can only be obtained through years of software engineering practice. A number of studies indicate that popular methods applied in the literature for software cost estimation, such as linear regression, are not robust enough and do not yield accurate predictions. Recently the dual variables Ridge Regression (RR) technique has been used for effort estimation yielding promising results. In this work we show that results may be further improved if an AI method is used to automatically select appropriate project cost drivers (inputs) for the technique. We propose a hybrid approach combining RR with a Genetic Algorithm, the latter evolving the subset of attributes for approximating effort more accurately. The proposed hybrid cost model has been applied on a widely known high-dimensional dataset of software project samples and the results obtained show that accuracy may be increased if redundant attributes are eliminated.",0
"In multiagent e-marketplaces, buying agents need to select good sellers by querying other buyers (called advisors). Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have shown to be an effective framework for optimally selecting sellers by selectively querying advisors. However, current solution methods do not scale to hundreds or even tens of agents operating in the e-market. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of POMDP Experts (MOPE) technique, which exploits the inherent structure of trust-based domains, such as the seller selection problem in e-markets, by aggregating the solutions of smaller sub-POMDPs. We propose a number of variants of the MOPE approach that we analyze theoretically and empirically. Experiments show that MOPE can scale up to a hundred agents thereby leveraging the presence of more advisors to significantly improve buyer satisfaction.",0
"Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) based set bounds propagation is a powerful approach to solving set-constraint satisfaction problems. However, prior BDD based techniques in- cur the significant overhead of constructing and manipulating graphs during search. We present a set-constraint solver which combines BDD-based set-bounds propagators with the learning abilities of a modern SAT solver. Together with a number of improvements beyond the basic algorithm, this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based set constraint solvers.",0
"Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.",0
"Language students are most engaged while reading texts at an appropriate difficulty level. However, existing methods of evaluating text difficulty focus mainly on vocabulary and do not prioritize grammatical features, hence they do not work well for language learners with limited knowledge of grammar. In this paper, we introduce grammatical templates, the expert-identified units of grammar that students learn from class, as an important feature of text difficulty evaluation. Experimental classification results show that grammatical template features significantly improve text difficulty prediction accuracy over baseline readability features by 7.4%. Moreover, we build a simple and human-understandable text difficulty evaluation approach with 87.7% accuracy, using only 5 grammatical template features.",0
"We consider the problem of finding good finite-horizon policies for POMDPs under the expected reward metric. The policies considered are {em free finite-memory policies with limited memory}; a policy is a mapping from the space of observation-memory pairs to the space of action-memeory pairs (the policy updates the memory as it goes), and the number of possible memory states is a parameter of the input to the policy-finding algorithms. The algorithms considered here are preliminary implementations of three search heuristics: local search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. We compare their outcomes to each other and to the optimal policies for each instance. We compare run times of each policy and of a dynamic programming algorithm for POMDPs developed by Hansen that iteratively improves a finite-state controller --- the previous state of the art for finite memory policies. The value of the best policy can only improve as the amount of memory increases, up to the amount needed for an optimal finite-memory policy. Our most surprising finding is that more memory helps in another way: given more memory than is needed for an optimal policy, the algorithms are more likely to converge to optimal-valued policies.",0
"In railway operations, a timetable is established to determine the departure and arrival times for the trains or other rolling stock at the different stations or relevant points inside the rail network or a subset of this network. The elaboration of this timetable is done to respond to the commercial requirements for both passenger and freight traffic, but also it must respect a set of security and capacity constraints associated with the railway network, rolling stock and legislation. Combining these requirements and constraints, as well as the important number of trains and schedules to plan, makes the preparation of a feasible timetable a complex and time-consuming process, that normally takes several months to be completed. This article addresses the problem of generating periodic timetables, which means that the involved trains operate in a recurrent pattern. For instance, the trains belonging to the same train line, depart from some station every 15 minutes or one hour. To tackle the problem, we present a constraint-based model suitable for this kind of problem. Then, we propose a genetic algorithm, allowing a rapid generation of feasible periodic timetables. Finally, two case studies are presented, the first, describing a sub-set of the Netherlands rail network, and the second a large portion of the Nord-pas-de-Calais regional rail network, both of them are then solved using our algorithm and the results are presented and discussed.",0
"Subspace clustering aims to group data points into multiple clusters of which each corresponds to one subspace. Most existing subspace clustering methods assume that the data could be linearly represented with each other in the input space. In practice, however, this assumption is hard to be satisfied. To achieve nonlinear subspace clustering, we propose a novel method which consists of the following three steps: 1) projecting the data into a hidden space in which the data can be linearly reconstructed from each other; 2) calculating the globally linear reconstruction coefficients in the kernel space; 3) truncating the trivial coefficients to achieve robustness and block-diagonality, and then achieving clustering by solving a graph Laplacian problem. Our method has the advantages of a closed-form solution and capacity of clustering data points that lie in nonlinear subspaces. The first advantage makes our method efficient in handling large-scale data sets, and the second one enables the proposed method to address the nonlinear subspace clustering challenge. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with ten state-of-the-art approaches regarding four evaluation metrics.",0
"The effect of inaccuracies in the parameters of a dynamic Bayesian network can be investigated by subjecting the network to a sensitivity analysis. Having detailed the resulting sensitivity functions in our previous work, we now study the effect of parameter inaccuracies on a recommended decision in view of a threshold decision-making model. We detail the effect of varying a single and multiple parameters from a conditional probability table and present a computational procedure for establishing bounds between which assessments for these parameters can be varied without inducing a change in the recommended decision. We illustrate the various concepts involved by means of a real-life dynamic network in the field of infectious disease.",0
"With the growing popularity of Social Web applications, more and more user data is published on the Web everyday.

"This paper presents a study of the dynamic coupling between a user and a virtual character during body interaction. Coupling is directly linked with other dimensions, such as co-presence, engagement, and believability, and was measured in an experiment that allowed users to describe their subjective feelings about those dimensions of interest. The experiment was based on a theatrical game involving the imitation of slow upper-body movements and the proposal of new movements by the user and virtual agent. The agent's behaviour varied in autonomy: the agent could limit itself to imitating the user's movements only, initiate new movements, or combine both behaviours. After the game, each participant completed a questionnaire regarding their engagement in the interaction, their subjective feeling about the co-presence of the agent, etc. Based on four main dimensions of interest, we tested several hypotheses against our experimental results, which are discussed here.",0
"We present a simple and efficient approach for learning to rank. It is an instance of a more general method for learning max-weight matching predictors in bipartite graphs, which has applications beyond ranking. The method consists of performing maximum a posteriori estimation in exponential families with suitable sufficient statistics. We apply the method to a standard benchmark dataset for learning web page ranking, obtaining state-of-the-art results.",1
"In previous work [BGHK92, BGHK93], we have studied the random-worlds approach -- a particular (and quite powerful) method for generating degrees of belief (i.e., subjective probabilities) from a knowledge base consisting of objective (first-order, statistical, and default) information. But allowing a knowledge base to contain only objective information is sometimes limiting. We occasionally wish to include information about degrees of belief in the knowledge base as well, because there are contexts in which old beliefs represent important information that should influence new beliefs. In this paper, we describe three quite general techniques for extending a method that generates degrees of belief from objective information to one that can make use of degrees of belief as well. All of our techniques are bloused on well-known approaches, such as cross-entropy. We discuss general connections between the techniques and in particular show that, although conceptually and technically quite different, all of the techniques give the same answer when applied to the random-worlds method.",0
"Interpersonal relations are fickle, with close friendships often dissolving into enmity. In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where players form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal.",1
"We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online learning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: The degree of sparsity is continuous -- a parameter controls the rate of sparsification from no sparsification to total sparsification. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular $L_1$-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsification result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online learning guarantees. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several datasets and find that for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.",1
"In this paper, we extend the Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem to {\L}ukasiewicz logic. The MaxSAT problem for a set of formulae {\Phi} is the problem of finding an assignment to the variables in {\Phi} that satisfies the maximum number of formulae. Three possible solutions (encodings) are proposed to the new problem: (1) Disjunctive Linear Relations (DLRs), (2) Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and (3) Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP). Like its Boolean counterpart, the extended fuzzy MaxSAT will have numerous applications in optimization problems that involve vagueness.",0
"We can program a Real-Time (RT) music improvisation system in C++ without a formal semantic or we can model it with process calculi such as the Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint (ntcc) calculus. ""A Concurrent Constraints Factor Oracle (FO) model for Music Improvisation"" (Ccfomi) is an improvisation model specified on ntcc. Since Ccfomi improvises non-deterministically, there is no control on choices and therefore little control over the sequence variation during the improvisation. To avoid this, we extended Ccfomi using the Probabilistic Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint calculus. Our extension to Ccfomi does not change the time and space complexity of building the FO, thus making our extension compatible with RT. However, there was not a ntcc interpreter capable of RT to execute Ccfomi. We developed Ntccrt --a RT capable interpreter for ntcc-- and we executed Ccfomi on Ntccrt. In the future, we plan to extend Ntccrt to execute our extension to Ccfomi.",0
"We have recently introduced an any-space algorithm for exact inference in Bayesian networks, called Recursive Conditioning, RC, which allows one to trade space with time at increments of X-bytes, where X is the number of bytes needed to cache a floating point number. In this paper, we present three key extensions of RC. First, we modify the algorithm so it applies to more general factorization of probability distributions, including (but not limited to) Bayesian network factorizations. Second, we present a forgetting mechanism which reduces the space requirements of RC considerably and then compare such requirmenets with those of variable elimination on a number of realistic networks, showing orders of magnitude improvements in certain cases. Third, we present a version of RC for computing maximum a posteriori hypotheses (MAP), which turns out to be the first MAP algorithm allowing a smooth time-space tradeoff. A key advantage of presented MAP algorithm is that it does not have to start from scratch each time a new query is presented, but can reuse some of its computations across multiple queries, leading to significant savings in ceratain cases.",0
"This paper presents a solution to Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) large scale route planning and task assignment joint problem. Given a set of constraints (e.g., time) and a set of task priority values, the goal is to find the optimal route for underwater mission that maximizes the sum of the priorities and minimizes the total risk percentage while meeting the given constraints. Making use of the heuristic nature of genetic and swarm intelligence algorithms in solving NP-hard graph problems, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are employed to find the optimum solution, where each individual in the population is a candidate solution (route). To evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods, the performance of the all PS and GA algorithms are examined and compared for a number of Monte Carlo runs. Simulation results suggest that the routes generated by both algorithms are feasible and reliable enough, and applicable for underwater motion planning. However, the GA-based route planner produces superior results comparing to the results obtained from the PSO based route planner.",0
"Influence diagrams serve as a powerful tool for modelling symmetric decision problems. When solving an influence diagram we determine a set of strategies for the decisions involved. A strategy for a decision variable is in principle a function over its past. However, some of the past may be irrelevant for the decision, and for computational reasons it is important not to deal with redundant variables in the strategies. We show that current methods (e.g. the ""Decision Bayes-ball"" algorithm by Shachter UAI98) do not determine the relevant past, and we present a complete algorithm.",0
"Most machine learning models are static, but the world is dynamic, and increasing online deployment of learned models gives increasing urgency to the development of efficient and effective mechanisms to address learning in the context of non-stationary distributions, or as it is commonly called concept drift. However, the key issue of characterizing the different types of drift that can occur has not previously been subjected to rigorous definition and analysis. In particular, while some qualitative drift categorizations have been proposed, few have been formally defined, and the quantitative descriptions required for detailed understanding of learner performance have not existed. We present the first comprehensive framework for quantitative analysis of drift. This supports the development of the first comprehensive set of formal definitions of types of concept drift. The formal definitions clarify ambiguities and identify gaps in previous definitions, giving rise to a new comprehensive taxonomy of concept drift types and a solid foundation for research into mechanisms to detect and address concept drift.",0
"Individuals have an intuitive perception of what makes a good coincidence. Though the sensitivity to coincidences has often been presented as resulting from an erroneous assessment of probability, it appears to be a genuine competence, based on non-trivial computations. The model presented here suggests that coincidences occur when subjects perceive complexity drops. Co-occurring events are, together, simpler than if considered separately. This model leads to a possible redefinition of subjective probability.",0
"We introduce the Binary Matrix Guessing Problem and provide two algorithms to solve this problem. The first algorithm we introduce is Elementwise Probing Algorithm (EPA) which is very fast under a score which utilizes Frobenius Distance. The second algorithm is Additive Reinforcement Learning Algorithm which combines ideas from perceptron algorithm and reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm is significantly slower compared to first one, but less restrictive and generalizes better. We compare computational performance of both algorithms and provide numerical results.",0
"The similarity between trajectory patterns in clustering has played an important role in discovering movement behaviour of different groups of mobile objects. Several approaches have been proposed to measure the similarity between sequences in trajectory data. Most of these measures are based on Euclidean space or on spatial network and some of them have been concerned with temporal aspect or ordering types. However, they are not appropriate to characteristics of spatiotemporal mobility patterns in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure for mobility patterns in cellular space of wireless network. The framework for constructing our measure is composed of two phases as follows. First, we present formal definitions to capture mathematically two spatial and temporal similarity measures for mobility patterns. And then, we define the total similarity measure by means of a weighted combination of these similarities. The truth of the partial and total similarity measures are proved in mathematics. Furthermore, instead of the time interval or ordering, our work makes use of the timestamp at which two mobility patterns share the same cell. A case study is also described to give a comparison of the combination measure with other ones.",0

Non-obviousness or inventive step is a general requirement for patentability in most patent law systems. An invention should be at an adequate distance beyond its prior art in order to be patented.

"Learning by observation can be of key importance whenever agents sharing similar features want to learn from each other. This paper presents an agent architecture that enables software agents to learn by direct observation of the actions executed by expert agents while they are performing a task. This is possible because the proposed architecture displays information that is essential for observation, making it possible for software agents to observe each other. The agent architecture supports a learning process that covers all aspects of learning by observation, such as discovering and observing experts, learning from the observed data, applying the acquired knowledge and evaluating the agents progress. The evaluation provides control over the decision to obtain new knowledge or apply the acquired knowledge to new problems. We combine two methods for learning from the observed information. The first one, the recall method, uses the sequence on which the actions were observed to solve new problems. The second one, the classification method, categorizes the information in the observed data and determines to which set of categories the new problems belong. Results show that agents are able to learn in conditions where common supervised learning algorithms fail, such as when agents do not know the results of their actions a priori or when not all the effects of the actions are visible. The results also show that our approach provides better results than other learning methods since it requires shorter learning periods.",0
"We present a visually-grounded language understanding model based on a study of how people verbally describe objects in scenes. The emphasis of the model is on the combination of individual word meanings to produce meanings for complex referring expressions. The model has been implemented, and it is able to understand a broad range of spatial referring expressions. We describe our implementation of word level visually-grounded semantics and their embedding in a compositional parsing framework. The implemented system selects the correct referents in response to natural language expressions for a large percentage of test cases. In an analysis of the system's successes and failures we reveal how visual context influences the semantics of utterances and propose future extensions to the model that take such context into account.",0
"Plausible reasoning concerns situations whose inherent lack of precision is not quantified; that is, there are no degrees or levels of precision, and hence no use of numbers like probabilities. A hopefully comprehensive set of principles that clarifies what it means for a formal logic to do plausible reasoning is presented. A new propositional logic, called Propositional Plausible Logic (PPL), is defined and applied to some important examples. PPL is the only non-numeric non-monotonic logic we know of that satisfies all the principles and correctly reasons with all the examples. Some important results about PPL are proved.",0

"This paper proposes algorithms for learning two-level Boolean rules in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF, i.e. AND-of-ORs) or Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF, i.e. OR-of-ANDs) as a type of human-interpretable classification model, aiming for a favorable trade-off between the classification accuracy and the simplicity of the rule. Two formulations are proposed. The first is an integer program whose objective function is a combination of the total number of errors and the total number of features used in the rule. We generalize a previously proposed linear programming (LP) relaxation from one-level to two-level rules. The second formulation replaces the 0-1 classification error with the Hamming distance from the current two-level rule to the closest rule that correctly classifies a sample. Based on this second formulation, block coordinate descent and alternating minimization algorithms are developed. Experiments show that the two-level rules can yield noticeably better performance than one-level rules due to their dramatically larger modeling capacity, and the two algorithms based on the Hamming distance formulation are generally superior to the other two-level rule learning methods in our comparison. A proposed approach to binarize any fractional values in the optimal solutions of LP relaxations is also shown to be effective.",0
"We develop a new semantics for defeasible inference based on extended probability measures allowed to take infinitesimal values, on the interpretation of defaults as generalized conditional probability constraints and on a preferred-model implementation of entropy maximization.",0
"We are interested in bridging the world of natural language and the world of the semantic web in particular to support natural multilingual access to the web of data. In this paper we introduce a new type of lexical ontology called interlingual lexical ontology (ILexicOn), which uses semantic web formalisms to make each interlingual lexical unit class (ILUc) support the projection of its semantic decomposition on itself. After a short overview of existing lexical ontologies, we briefly introduce the semantic web formalisms we use. We then present the three layered architecture of our approach: i) the interlingual lexical meta-ontology (ILexiMOn); ii) the ILexicOn where ILUcs are formally defined; iii) the data layer. We illustrate our approach with a standalone ILexicOn, and introduce and explain a concise human-readable notation to represent ILexicOns. Finally, we show how semantic web formalisms enable the projection of a semantic decomposition on the decomposed ILUc.",0
"As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.",1
"Over time, there have hen refinements in the way that probability distributions are used for representing beliefs. Models which rely on single probability distributions depict a complete ordering among the propositions of interest, yet human beliefs are sometimes not completely ordered. Non-singleton sets of probability distributions can represent partially ordered beliefs. Convex sets are particularly convenient and expressive, but it is known that there are reasonable patterns of belief whose faithful representation require less restrictive sets. The present paper shows that prior ignorance about three or more exclusive alternatives and the emergence of partially ordered beliefs when evidence is obtained defy representation by any single set of distributions, but yield to a representation baud on several uts. The partial order is shown to be a partial qualitative probability which shares some intuitively appealing attributes with probability distributions.",0
"We present a unified approach for learning the parameters of Sum-Product networks (SPNs). We prove that any complete and decomposable SPN is equivalent to a mixture of trees where each tree corresponds to a product of univariate distributions. Based on the mixture model perspective, we characterize the objective function when learning SPNs based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle and show that the optimization problem can be formulated as a signomial program. Both the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the exponentiated gradient (EG) in this setting can be viewed as first order approximations of the signomial program after proper transformation of the objective function. Based on the signomial program formulation, we construct two parameter learning algorithms for SPNs by using sequential monomial approximations (SMA) and the concave-convex procedure (CCCP), respectively. The two proposed methods naturally admit multiplicative updates, hence effectively avoiding the projection operation. With the help of the a unified framework, we also show an intrinsic connection between CCCP and Expectation Maximization (EM), where EM turns out to be another relaxation of the signomial program. Extensive experiments on 20 data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the two proposed approaches for learning SPNs. We also show that the proposed methods can improve the performance of structure learning and yield state-of-the-art results.",1
"I present a parallel algorithm for exact probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. For polytree networks with n variables, the worst-case time complexity is O(log n) on a CREW PRAM (concurrent-read, exclusive-write parallel random-access machine) with n processors, for any constant number of evidence variables. For arbitrary networks, the time complexity is O(r^{3w}*log n) for n processors, or O(w*log n) for r^{3w}*n processors, where r is the maximum range of any variable, and w is the induced width (the maximum clique size), after moralizing and triangulating the network.",0
"Decomposable models and Bayesian networks can be defined as sequences of oligo-dimensional probability measures connected with operators of composition. The preliminary results suggest that the probabilistic models allowing for effective computational procedures are represented by sequences possessing a special property; we shall call them perfect sequences. The paper lays down the elementary foundation necessary for further study of iterative application of operators of composition. We believe to develop a technique describing several graph models in a unifying way. We are convinced that practically all theoretical results and procedures connected with decomposable models and Bayesian networks can be translated into the terminology introduced in this paper. For example, complexity of computational procedures in these models is closely dependent on possibility to change the ordering of oligo-dimensional measures defining the model. Therefore, in this paper, lot of attention is paid to possibility to change ordering of the operators of composition.",0
"Languages for open-universe probabilistic models (OUPMs) can represent situations with an unknown number of objects and iden- tity uncertainty. While such cases arise in a wide range of important real-world appli- cations, existing general purpose inference methods for OUPMs are far less efficient than those available for more restricted lan- guages and model classes. This paper goes some way to remedying this deficit by in- troducing, and proving correct, a generaliza- tion of Gibbs sampling to partial worlds with possibly varying model structure. Our ap- proach draws on and extends previous generic OUPM inference methods, as well as aux- iliary variable samplers for nonparametric mixture models. It has been implemented for BLOG, a well-known OUPM language. Combined with compile-time optimizations, the resulting algorithm yields very substan- tial speedups over existing methods on sev- eral test cases, and substantially improves the practicality of OUPM languages generally.",0
"The question of how procedural knowledge is represented and inferred is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recent work on program induction has proposed neural architectures, based on abstractions like stacks, Turing machines, and interpreters, that operate on abstract computational machines or on execution traces. But the recursive abstraction that is central to procedural knowledge is perhaps most naturally represented by symbolic representations that have syntactic structure, such as logical expressions and source code. Combining abstract, symbolic reasoning with continuous neural reasoning is a grand challenge of representation learning. As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence networks, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of mathematical and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.",1
"Humans develop a common sense of style compatibility between items based on their attributes. We seek to automatically answer questions like ""Does this shirt go well with that pair of jeans?"" In order to answer these kinds of questions, we attempt to model human sense of style compatibility in this paper. The basic assumption of our approach is that most of the important attributes for a product in an online store are included in its title description. Therefore it is feasible to learn style compatibility from these descriptions. We design a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture and feed it with title pairs of items, which are either compatible or incompatible. Those pairs will be mapped from the original space of symbolic words into some embedded style space. Our approach takes only words as the input with few preprocessing and there is no laborious and expensive feature engineering.",0
"Large computer-understandable proofs consist of millions of intermediate logical steps. The vast majority of such steps originate from manually selected and manually guided heuristics applied to intermediate goals. So far, machine learning has generally not been used to filter or generate these steps. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset based on Higher-Order Logic (HOL) proofs, for the purpose of developing new machine learning-based theorem-proving strategies. We make this dataset publicly available under the BSD license. We propose various machine learning tasks that can be performed on this dataset, and discuss their significance for theorem proving. We also benchmark a set of simple baseline machine learning models suited for the tasks (including logistic regression, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks). The results of our baseline models show the promise of applying machine learning to HOL theorem proving.",1
"Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&amp;A) is the process of extracting and predicting business-critical insights from data. Traditional BI focused on data collection, extraction, and organization to enable efficient query processing for deriving insights from historical data. With the rise of big data and cloud computing, there are many challenges and opportunities for the BI. Especially with the growing number of data sources, traditional BI\&amp;A are evolving to provide intelligence at different scales and perspectives - operational BI, situational BI, self-service BI. In this survey, we review the evolution of business intelligence systems in full scale from back-end architecture to and front-end applications. We focus on the changes in the back-end architecture that deals with the collection and organization of the data. We also review the changes in the front-end applications, where analytic services and visualization are the core components. Using a uses case from BI in Healthcare, which is one of the most complex enterprises, we show how BI\&amp;A will play an important role beyond the traditional usage. The survey provides a holistic view of Business Intelligence and Analytics for anyone interested in getting a complete picture of the different pieces in the emerging next generation BI\&amp;A solutions.",0
"The maturity of deep learning techniques has led in recent years to a breakthrough in object recognition in visual media. While for some specific benchmarks, neural techniques seem to match if not outperform human judgement, challenges are still open for detecting arbitrary concepts in arbitrary videos. In this paper, we propose a system that combines neural techniques, a large scale visual concepts ontology, and an active learning loop, to provide on the fly model learning of arbitrary concepts. We give an overview of the system as a whole, and focus on the central role of the ontology for guiding and bootstrapping the learning of new concepts, improving the recall of concept detection, and, on the user end, providing semantic search on a library of annotated videos.",0
"The longest arc-preserving common subsequence problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem from the field of computational biology. This problem finds applications, in particular, in the comparison of arc-annotated Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences. In this work we propose a simple, hybrid evolutionary algorithm to tackle this problem. The most important feature of this algorithm concerns a crossover operator based on solution merging. In solution merging, two or more solutions to the problem are merged, and an exact technique is used to find the best solution within this union. It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms a heuristic from the literature.",0
"Multiple automakers have in development or in production automated driving systems (ADS) that offer freeway-pilot functions. This type of ADS is typically limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives (e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the merging vehicle optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem, we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow conditions.",0
"Purpose: In this paper, we investigate a framework for interactive brain tumor segmentation which, at its core, treats the problem of interactive brain tumor segmentation as a machine learning problem.",0
"The research on conditional planning rejects the assumptions that there is no uncertainty or incompleteness of knowledge with respect to the state and changes of the system the plans operate on. Without these assumptions the sequences of operations that achieve the goals depend on the initial state and the outcomes of nondeterministic changes in the system. This setting raises the questions of how to represent the plans and how to perform plan search. The answers are quite different from those in the simpler classical framework. In this paper, we approach conditional planning from a new viewpoint that is motivated by the use of satisfiability algorithms in classical planning. Translating conditional planning to formulae in the propositional logic is not feasible because of inherent computational limitations. Instead, we translate conditional planning to quantified Boolean formulae. We discuss three formalizations of conditional planning as quantified Boolean formulae, and present experimental results obtained with a theorem-prover.",0
"In this work we explore deep generative models of text in which the latent representation of a document is itself drawn from a discrete language model distribution. We formulate a variational auto-encoder for inference in this model and apply it to the task of compressing sentences. In this application the generative model first draws a latent summary sentence from a background language model, and then subsequently draws the observed sentence conditioned on this latent summary. In our empirical evaluation we show that generative formulations of both abstractive and extractive compression yield state-of-the-art results when trained on a large amount of supervised data. Further, we explore semi-supervised compression scenarios where we show that it is possible to achieve performance competitive with previously proposed supervised models while training on a fraction of the supervised data.",1
"We survey concepts at the frontier of research connecting artificial, animal and human cognition to computation and information processing---from the Turing test to Searle's Chinese Room argument, from Integrated Information Theory to computational and algorithmic complexity. We start by arguing that passing the Turing test is a trivial computational problem and that its pragmatic difficulty sheds light on the computational nature of the human mind more than it does on the challenge of artificial intelligence. We then review our proposed algorithmic information-theoretic measures for quantifying and characterizing cognition in various forms. These are capable of accounting for known biases in human behavior, thus vindicating a computational algorithmic view of cognition as first suggested by Turing, but this time rooted in the concept of algorithmic probability, which in turn is based on computational universality while being independent of computational model, and which has the virtue of being predictive and testable as a model theory of cognitive behavior.",0
"Modeling spike firing assumes that spiking statistics are Poisson, but real data violates this assumption. To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis with tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another distribution. Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the ionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully modeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try to quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing Planck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We introduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the tyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic transformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke. Investigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking, with over 97% match.",0
"Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a neural network model which is used to obtain a topology-preserving mapping from the (usually high dimensional) input/feature space to an output/map space of fewer dimensions (usually two or three in order to facilitate visualization). Neurons in the output space are connected with each other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning is achieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space. Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structure limitation they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removal of a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposed called AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates a more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during training and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid by allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments using multiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves training performance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset and provides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of neurons.",0
"The use of virtual agents in social coaching has increased rapidly in the last decade. In order to train the user in different situations than can occur in real life, the virtual agent should be able to express different social attitudes. In this paper, we propose a model of social attitudes that enables a virtual agent to reason on the appropriate social attitude to express during the interaction with a user given the course of the interaction, but also the emotions, mood and personality of the agent. Moreover, the model enables the virtual agent to display its social attitude through its non-verbal behaviour. The proposed model has been developed in the context of job interview simulation. The methodology used to develop such a model combined a theoretical and an empirical approach. Indeed, the model is based both on the literature in Human and Social Sciences on social attitudes but also on the analysis of an audiovisual corpus of job interviews and on post-hoc interviews with the recruiters on their expressed attitudes during the job interview.",0
"User preference integration is of great importance in multiobjective optimization, in particular in many objective optimization. Preferences have long been considered in traditional multicriteria decision making (MCDM) which is based on mathematical programming and recently it is integrated in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO), resulting in focus on preferred parts of the Pareto front instead of the whole Pareto front. The number of publications and results on preference-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (PMOEAs) has increased rapidly over the past decade. There already exists a large variety of preference handling methods and EMO methods, which have been combined in various ways. This article proposes to use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to model and systematize the results developed in this field. An extensive review of the existing work is provided, based on which an ontology is built and instantiated with state of the art results. The OWL ontology is made public and open to future extension. Moreover, the usage of the ontology is exemplified for different use-cases, including training new researchers into this knowledge domain, querying for methods that match an application problem in engineering optimization, checking existence of combinations of preference models and EMO techniques, and discovering opportunities for new research and open research questions.",0
"Managed Multi-Context Systems (mMCSs) provide a general framework for integrating knowledge represented in heterogeneous KR formalisms. Recently, evolving Multi-Context Systems (eMCSs) have been introduced as an extension of mMCSs that add the ability to both react to, and reason in the presence of commonly temporary dynamic observations, and evolve by incorporating new knowledge. However, the general complexity of such an expressive formalism may simply be too high in cases where huge amounts of information have to be processed within a limited short amount of time, or even instantaneously. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions eMCSs may scale in such situations and we show that such polynomial eMCSs can be applied in a practical use case.",0
"The exponential explosion of the set of patterns is one of the main challenges in pattern mining. This challenge is approached by introducing a constraint for pattern selection. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints.",0
"Media is full of false claims. Even Oxford Dictionaries named ""post-truth"" as the word of 2016. This makes it more important than ever to build systems that can identify the veracity of a story, and the kind of discourse there is around it. RumourEval is a SemEval shared task that aims to identify and handle rumours and reactions to them, in text. We present an annotation scheme, a large dataset covering multiple topics - each having their own families of claims and replies - and use these to pose two concrete challenges as well as the results achieved by participants on these challenges.",0
"A Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is a special type of Teachable Agent which incorporates a persuasion theory in order to provide persuasive and more personalized feedback to the student. By employing the persuasion techniques, the PTA seeks to maintain the student in a high motivation and high ability state in which he or she has higher cognitive ability and his or her changes in attitudes are more persistent. However, the existing model of the PTA still has a few limitations. Firstly, the existing PTA model focuses on modelling the PTA's ability to persuade, while does not model its ability to be taught by the student and to practice the knowledge it has learnt. Secondly, the quantitative model for computational processes in the PTA has low reusability. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of the PTA.",0
"Reprogramming matter may sound far-fetched, but we have been doing it with increasing power and staggering efficiency for at least 60 years, and for centuries we have been paving the way toward the ultimate reprogrammed fate of the universe, the vessel of all programs. How will we be doing it in 60 years' time and how will it impact life and the purpose both of machines and of humans?",0
"Whether teaching in a classroom or a Massive Online Open Course it is crucial to present the material in a way that benefits the audience as a whole. We identify two important tasks to solve towards this objective, 1 group students so that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and 2 find an optimal schedule of the educational material for each group. Thus, in this paper, we solve the problem of team formation and content scheduling for education. Given a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need to learn different activities T and given k as the number of desired groups, we study the problem of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best schedule for each group. We show this problem to be NP-hard and develop a polynomial algorithm for it. We show our algorithm to be effective both on synthetic as well as a real data set. For our experiments, we use real data on students' grades in a Computer Science department. As part of our contribution, we release a semi-synthetic dataset that mimics the properties of the real data.",0
"Penalty logic, introduced by Pinkas, associates to each formula of a knowledge base the price to pay if this formula is violated. Penalties may be used as a criterion for selecting preferred consistent subsets in an inconsistent knowledge base, thus inducing a non-monotonic inference relation. A precise formalization and the main properties of penalty logic and of its associated non-monotonic inference relation are given in the first part. We also show that penalty logic and Dempster-Shafer theory are related, especially in the infinitesimal case.",0
"Mutation has traditionally been regarded as an important operator in evolutionary algorithms. In particular, there have been many experimental studies which showed the effectiveness of adapting mutation rates for various static optimization problems. Given the perceived effectiveness of adaptive and self-adaptive mutation for static optimization problems, there have been speculations that adaptive and self-adaptive mutation can benefit dynamic optimization problems even more since adaptation and self-adaptation are capable of following a dynamic environment. However, few theoretical results are available in analyzing rigorously evolutionary algorithms for dynamic optimization problems. It is unclear when adaptive and self-adaptive mutation rates are likely to be useful for evolutionary algorithms in solving dynamic optimization problems. This paper provides the first rigorous analysis of adaptive mutation and its impact on the computation times of evolutionary algorithms in solving certain dynamic optimization problems. More specifically, for both individual-based and population-based EAs, we have shown that any time-variable mutation rate scheme will not significantly outperform a fixed mutation rate on some dynamic optimization problem instances. The proofs also offer some insights into conditions under which any time-variable mutation scheme is unlikely to be useful and into the relationships between the problem characteristics and algorithmic features (e.g., different mutation schemes).",0
This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in a digital video broadcasting (DVB) system from providers' perspective. We learn a probabilistic deterministic real timed automaton profiling benign behavior of encryption control in the DVB control access system. This profile is used as a one-class classifier. Anomalous items in a testing sequence are detected when the sequence is not accepted by the learned model.,0
"There has been an explosion of work in the vision &amp; language community during the past few years from image captioning to video transcription, and answering questions about images. These tasks focus on literal descriptions of the image. To move beyond the literal, we choose to explore how questions about an image often address abstract events that the objects evoke. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of 'Visual Question Generation (VQG)', where the system is tasked with asking a natural and engaging question when shown an image. We provide three datasets which cover a variety of images from object-centric to event-centric, providing different and more abstract training data than the state-of-the-art captioning systems have used thus far. We train and test several generative and retrieval models to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation results show that while such models ask reasonable questions given various images, there is still a wide gap with human performance. Our proposed task offers a new challenge to the community which we hope can spur further interest in exploring deeper connections between vision &amp; language.",1
"Constraint programming can definitely be seen as a model-driven paradigm. The users write programs for modeling problems. These programs are mapped to executable models to calculate the solutions. This paper focuses on efficient model management (definition and transformation). From this point of view, we propose to revisit the design of constraint-programming systems. A model-driven architecture is introduced to map solving-independent constraint models to solving-dependent decision models. Several important questions are examined, such as the need for a visual highlevel modeling language, and the quality of metamodeling techniques to implement the transformations. A main result is the s-COMMA platform that efficiently implements the chain from modeling to solving constraint problems",0
"Under some circumstances, a group of individuals may need to negotiate together as a negotiation team against another party. Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents' negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.",0
"We study the problem of learning the best Bayesian network structure with respect to a decomposable score such as BDe, BIC or AIC. This problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that solving it becomes quickly infeasible as the number of variables increases. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that it is possible to learn the best Bayesian network structure with over 30 variables, which covers many practically interesting cases. Our algorithm is less complicated and more efficient than the techniques presented earlier. It can be easily parallelized, and offers a possibility for efficient exploration of the best networks consistent with different variable orderings. In the experimental part of the paper we compare the performance of the algorithm to the previous state-of-the-art algorithm. Free source-code and an online-demo can be found at",0
"Constraint Programming (CP) solvers typically tackle optimization problems by repeatedly finding solutions to a problem while placing tighter and tighter bounds on the solution cost. This approach is somewhat naive, especially for soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in Boolean Satisfiability (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to hold initially. When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of soft constraints that cannot hold simultaneously. Using this information the problem is relaxed to allow certain soft constraint(s) to be violated and solving continues. Since Lazy Clause Generation (LCG) solvers can also return unsatisfiable cores we can adapt the MAXSAT unsatisfiable core approach to CP. We implement the original MAXSAT unsatisfiable core solving algorithms WPM1, MSU3 in a state-of-the-art LCG solver and show that there exist problems which benefit from this hybrid approach.",0
"In business analytics, measure values, such as sales numbers or volumes of cargo transported, are often summed along values of one or more corresponding categories, such as time or shipping container. However, not every measure should be added by default (e.g., one might more typically want a mean over the heights of a set of people); similarly, some measures should only be summed within certain constraints (e.g., population measures need not be summed over years). In systems such as Watson Analytics, the exact additive behaviour of a measure is often determined by a human expert. In this work, we propose a small set of features for this issue. We use these features in a case-based reasoning approach, where the system suggests an aggregation behaviour, with 86% accuracy in our collected dataset.",0
"The structure representation of data distribution plays an important role in understanding the underlying mechanism of generating data. In this paper, we propose nearest prime simplicial complex approaches (NSC) by utilizing persistent homology to capture such structures. Assuming that each class is represented with a prime simplicial complex, we classify unlabeled samples based on the nearest projection distances from the samples to the simplicial complexes. We also extend the extrapolation ability of these complexes with a projection constraint term. Experiments in simulated and practical datasets indicate that compared with several published algorithms, the proposed NSC approaches achieve promising performance without losing the structure representation.",0
"Each year, millions of motor vehicle traffic accidents all over the world cause a large number of fatalities, injuries and significant material loss. Automated Driving (AD) has potential to drastically reduce such accidents. In this work, we focus on the technical challenges that arise from AD in urban environments. We present the overall architecture of an AD system and describe in detail the perception and planning modules. The AD system, built on a modified Acura RLX, was demonstrated in a course in GoMentum Station in California. We demonstrated autonomous handling of 4 scenarios: traffic lights, cross-traffic at intersections, construction zones and pedestrians. The AD vehicle displayed safe behavior and performed consistently in repeated demonstrations with slight variations in conditions. Overall, we completed 44 runs, encompassing 110km of automated driving with only 3 cases where the driver intervened the control of the vehicle, mostly due to error in GPS positioning. Our demonstration showed that robust and consistent behavior in urban scenarios is possible, yet more investigation is necessary for full scale roll-out on public roads.",0
"The performance of a Statistical Machine Translation System (SMT) system is proportionally directed to the quality and length of the parallel corpus it uses. However for some pair of languages there is a considerable lack of them. The long term goal is to construct a Japanese-Spanish parallel corpus to be used for SMT, whereas, there are a lack of useful Japanese-Spanish parallel Corpus. To address this problem, In this study we proposed a method for extracting Japanese-Spanish Parallel Sentences from Wikipedia using POS tagging and Rule-Based approach. The main focus of this approach is the syntactic features of both languages. Human evaluation was performed over a sample and shows promising results, in comparison with the baseline.",0
"We conjecture that the worst case number of experiments necessary and sufficient to discover a causal graph uniquely given its observational Markov equivalence class can be specified as a function of the largest clique in the Markov equivalence class. We provide an algorithm that computes intervention sets that we believe are optimal for the above task. The algorithm builds on insights gained from the worst case analysis in Eberhardt et al. (2005) for sequences of experiments when all possible directed acyclic graphs over N variables are considered. A simulation suggests that our conjecture is correct. We also show that a generalization of our conjecture to other classes of possible graph hypotheses cannot be given easily, and in what sense the algorithm is then no longer optimal.",0
"This paper introduces conceptual relations that synthesize utilitarian and logical concepts, extending the logics of preference of Rescher. We define first, in the context of a possible worlds model, constraint-dependent measures that quantify the relative quality of alternative solutions of reasoning problems or the relative desirability of various policies in control, decision, and planning problems. We show that these measures may be interpreted as truth values in a multi valued logic and propose mechanisms for the representation of complex constraints as combinations of simpler restrictions. These extended logical operations permit also the combination and aggregation of goal-specific quality measures into global measures of utility. We identify also relations that represent differential preferences between alternative solutions and relate them to the previously defined desirability measures. Extending conventional modal logic formulations, we introduce structures for the representation of ignorance about the utility of alternative solutions. Finally, we examine relations between these concepts and similarity based semantic models of fuzzy logic.",0
"In recent years, there has been much interest in phase transitions of combinatorial problems. Phase transitions have been successfully used to analyze combinatorial optimization problems, characterize their typical-case features and locate the hardest problem instances. In this paper, we study phase transitions of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that has many real-world applications. Using random instances of up to 1,500 cities in which intercity distances are uniformly distributed, we empirically show that many properties of the problem, including the optimal tour cost and backbone size, experience sharp transitions as the precision of intercity distances increases across a critical value. Our experimental results on the costs of the ATSP tours and assignment problem agree with the theoretical result that the asymptotic cost of assignment problem is pi ^2 /6 the number of cities goes to infinity. In addition, we show that the average computational cost of the well-known branch-and-bound subtour elimination algorithm for the problem also exhibits a thrashing behavior, transitioning from easy to difficult as the distance precision increases. These results answer positively an open question regarding the existence of phase transitions in the ATSP, and provide guidance on how difficult ATSP problem instances should be generated.",0
"The interest in the combination of probability with logics for modeling the world has rapidly increased in the last few years. One of the most effective approaches is the Distribution Semantics which was adopted by many logic programming languages and in Descripion Logics. In this paper, we illustrate the work we have done in this research field by presenting a probabilistic semantics for description logics and reasoning and learning algorithms. In particular, we present in detail the system TRILL P, which computes the probability of queries w.r.t. probabilistic knowledge bases, which has been implemented in Prolog. An extended abstract / full version of a paper accepted to be presented at the Doctoral Consortium of the 30th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2014), July 19-22, Vienna, Austria",0
"The SPARQL query language is currently being extended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) with so-called entailment regimes. An entailment regime defines how queries are evaluated under more expressive semantics than SPARQLs standard simple entailment, which is based on subgraph matching. The queries are very expressive since variables can occur within complex concepts and can also bind to concept or role names. In this paper, we describe a sound and complete algorithm for the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime. We further propose several novel optimizations such as strategies for determining a good query execution order, query rewriting techniques, and show how specialized OWL reasoning tasks and the concept and role hierarchy can be used to reduce the query execution time. For determining a good execution order, we propose a cost-based model, where the costs are based on information about the instances of concepts and roles that are extracted from a model abstraction built by an OWL reasoner. We present two ordering strategies: a static and a dynamic one. For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster. We provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed optimizations. Our experimental study shows that the static ordering usually outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available. This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate, e.g., due to nondeterministic reasoning decisions. For queries that go beyond conjunctive instance queries we observe an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude due to the proposed optimizations.",0
"Document classification for text, images and other applicable entities has long been a focus of research in academia and also finds application in many industrial settings. Amidst a plethora of approaches to solve such problems, machine-learning techniques have found success in a variety of scenarios. In this paper we discuss the design of a machine learning-based semi-supervised job title classification system for the online job recruitment domain currently in production at CareerBuilder.com and propose enhancements to it. The system leverages a varied collection of classification as well clustering algorithms. These algorithms are encompassed in an architecture that facilitates leveraging existing off-the-shelf machine learning tools and techniques while keeping into consideration the challenges of constructing a scalable classification system for a large taxonomy of categories. As a continuously evolving system that is still under development we first discuss the existing semi-supervised classification system which is composed of both clustering and classification components in a proximity-based classifier setup and results of which are already used across numerous products at CareerBuilder. We then elucidate our long-term goals for job title classification and propose enhancements to the existing system in the form of a two-stage coarse and fine level classifier augmentation to construct a cascade of hierarchical vertical classifiers. Preliminary results are presented using experimental evaluation on real world industrial data.",0
"Pervasive systems refers to context-aware systems that can sense their context, and adapt their behavior accordingly to provide adaptable services. Proactive adaptation of such systems allows changing the service and the context based on prediction. However, the definition of the context is still vague and not suitable to prediction. In this paper we discuss and classify previous definitions of context. Then, we present a new definition which allows pervasive systems to understand and predict their contexts. We analyze the essential lines that fall within the context definition, and propose some scenarios to make it clear our approach.",0
"We give an algorithm A which assigns probabilities to logical sentences. For any simple infinite sequence of sentences whose truth-values appear indistinguishable from a biased coin that outputs ""true"" with probability p, we have that the sequence of probabilities that A assigns to these sentences converges to p.",0
"We study the problem of identifying the best action among a set of possible options when the value of each action is given by a mapping from a number of noisy micro-observables in the so-called fixed confidence setting. Our main motivation is the application to the minimax game search, which has been a major topic of interest in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce an abstract setting to clearly describe the essential properties of the problem. While previous work only considered a two-move game tree search problem, our abstract setting can be applied to the general minimax games where the depth can be non-uniform and arbitrary, and transpositions are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm (LUCB-micro) for the abstract setting, and give its lower and upper sample complexity results. Our bounds recover some previous results, which were only available in more limited settings, while they also shed further light on how the structure of minimax problems influence sample complexity.",0
"Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is wildly applied in multi-sensor data fusion. However, lots of uncertainty and interference exist in practical situation, especially in the battle field. It is still an open issue to model the reliability of sensor reports. Many methods are proposed based on the relationship among collected data. In this letter, we proposed a quantum mechanical approach to evaluate the reliability of sensor reports, which is based on the properties of a sensor itself. The proposed method is used to modify the combining of evidences.",0
"Importance sampling is often used in machine learning when training and testing data come from different distributions. In this paper we propose a new variant of importance sampling that can reduce the variance of importance sampling-based estimates by orders of magnitude when the supports of the training and testing distributions differ. After motivating and presenting our new importance sampling estimator, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis that characterizes both its bias and variance relative to the ordinary importance sampling estimator (in various settings, which include cases where ordinary importance sampling is biased, while our new estimator is not, and vice versa). We conclude with an example of how our new importance sampling estimator can be used to improve estimates of how well a new treatment policy for diabetes will work for an individual, using only data from when the individual used a previous treatment policy.",1
"We present Solrex,an automated solver for the game of Reverse Hex.Reverse Hex, also known as Rex, or Misere Hex, is the variant of the game of Hex in which the player who joins her two sides loses the game. Solrex performs a mini-max search of the state space using Scalable Parallel Depth First Proof Number Search, enhanced by the pruning of inferior moves and the early detection of certain winning strategies. Solrex is implemented on the same code base as the Hex program Solver, and can solve arbitrary positions on board sizes up to 6x6, with the hardest position taking less than four hours on four threads.",0
"We study motion planning problems where agents move inside environments that are not fully observable and subject to uncertainties. The goal is to compute a strategy for an agent that is guaranteed to satisfy certain safety and performance specifications. Such problems are naturally modelled by partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Because of the potentially huge or even infinite belief space of POMDPs, verification and strategy synthesis is in general computationally intractable. We tackle this difficulty by exploiting typical structural properties of such scenarios; for instance, we assume that agents have the ability to observe their own positions inside an environment. Ambiguity in the state of the environment is abstracted into non-deterministic choices over the possible states of the environment. Technically, this abstraction transforms POMDPs into probabilistic two-player games (PGs). For these PGs, efficient verification tools are able to determine strategies that approximate certain measures on the POMDP. If an approximation is too coarse to provide guarantees, an abstraction refinement scheme further resolves the belief space of the POMDP. We demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art by orders of magnitude compared to a direct solution of the POMDP.",0
"For computer vision applications, prior works have shown the efficacy of reducing the numeric precision of model parameters (network weights) in deep neural networks but also that reducing the precision of activations hurts model accuracy much more than reducing the precision of model parameters. We study schemes to train networks from scratch using reduced-precision activations without hurting the model accuracy. We reduce the precision of activation maps (along with model parameters) using a novel quantization scheme and increase the number of filter maps in a layer, and find that this scheme compensates or surpasses the accuracy of the baseline full-precision network. As a result, one can significantly reduce the dynamic memory footprint, memory bandwidth, computational energy and speed up the training and inference process with appropriate hardware support. We call our scheme WRPN - wide reduced-precision networks. We report results using our proposed schemes and show that our results are better than previously reported accuracies on ILSVRC-12 dataset while being computationally less expensive compared to previously reported reduced-precision networks.",0
"Using the probability theory-based approach, this paper reveals the equivalence of an arbitrary NP-complete problem to a problem of checking whether a level hypersurface of a specifically constructed harmonic cost function (with all diagonal entries of its Hessian matrix equal to zero) intersects with a unit hypercube in many-dimensional Euclidean space. This connection suggests the possibility that methods of continuous mathematics can provide crucial insights into the most intriguing open questions in modern complexity theory.",0

Multi Expression Programming (MEP) is an evolutionary technique that may be used for solving computationally difficult problems. MEP uses a linear solution representation. Each MEP individual is a string encoding complex expressions (computer programs). A MEP individual may encode multiple solutions of the current problem. In this paper MEP is used for evolving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) heuristic for graphs satisfying triangle inequality. Evolved MEP heuristic is compared with Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NN) and Minimum Spanning Tree Heuristic (MST) on some difficult problems in TSPLIB. For most of the considered problems the evolved MEP heuristic outperforms NN and MST. The obtained algorithm was tested against some problems in TSPLIB. The results emphasizes that evolved MEP heuristic is a powerful tool for solving difficult TSP instances.,0
"The article contains a preliminary glance at balanced clustering problems. Basic balanced structures and combinatorial balanced problems are briefly described. A special attention is targeted to various balance/unbalance indices (including some new versions of the indices): by cluster cardinality, by cluster weights, by inter-cluster edge/arc weights, by cluster element structure (for element multi-type clustering). Further, versions of optimization clustering problems are suggested (including multicriteria problem formulations). Illustrative numerical examples describe calculation of balance indices and element multi-type balance clustering problems (including example for design of student teams).",0
"Circumscription and logic programs under the stable model semantics are two well-known nonmonotonic formalisms. The former has served as a basis of classical logic based action formalisms, such as the situation calculus, the event calculus and temporal action logics; the latter has served as a basis of a family of action languages, such as language A and several of its descendants. Based on the discovery that circumscription and the stable model semantics coincide on a class of canonical formulas, we reformulate the situation calculus and the event calculus in the general theory of stable models. We also present a translation that turns the reformulations further into answer set programs, so that efficient answer set solvers can be applied to compute the situation calculus and the event calculus.",0
"One major obstacle towards artificial intelligence is the poor ability of models to quickly solve new problems, without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. To better understand this issue, we study the problem of learning over a continuum of data, where the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning an ordered sequence of tasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second, we propose a model to learn over continuums of data, called Gradient of Episodic Memory (GEM), which alleviates forgetting while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when compared to the state-of-the-art.",1
"Since the advent of computers, many tasks which required humans to spend a lot of time and energy have been trivialized by the computers' ability to perform repetitive tasks extremely quickly. However there are still many areas in which humans excel in comparison with the machines. One such area is chess. Even with great advances in the speed and computational power of modern machines, Grandmasters often beat the best chess programs in the world with relative ease. This may be due to the fact that a game of chess cannot be won by pure calculation. There is more to the goodness of a chess position than some numerical value which apparently can be seen only by the human brain. Here an effort has been made to improve current chess engines by letting themselves evolve over a period of time. Firstly, the problem of learning is reduced into an optimization problem by defining Position Evaluation in terms of Positional Value Tables (PVTs). Next, the PVTs are optimized using Multi-Niche Crowding which successfully identifies the optima in a multimodal function, thereby arriving at distinctly different solutions which are close to the global optimum.",0
"We study methods for automated parsing of informal mathematical expressions into formal ones, a main prerequisite for deep computer understanding of informal mathematical texts. We propose a context-based parsing approach that combines efficient statistical learning of deep parse trees with their semantic pruning by type checking and large-theory automated theorem proving. We show that the methods very significantly improve on previous results in parsing theorems from the Flyspeck corpus.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach based on variable forgetting, which is a useful tool in resolving contradictory by filtering some given variables, to merging multiple knowledge bases. This paper first builds a relationship between belief merging and variable forgetting by using dilation. Variable forgetting is applied to capture belief merging operation. Finally, some new merging operators are developed by modifying candidate variables to amend the shortage of traditional merging operators. Different from model selection of traditional merging operators, as an alternative approach, variable selection in those new operators could provide intuitive information about an atom variable among whole knowledge bases.",0
"Memory can be defined as the ability to retain and recall information in a diverse range of forms. It is a vital component of the way in which we as human beings operate on a day to day basis. Given a particular situation, decisions are made and actions undertaken in response to that situation based on our memory of related prior events and experiences. By utilising our memory we can anticipate the outcome of our chosen actions to avoid unexpected or unwanted events. In addition, as we subtly alter our actions and recognise altered outcomes we learn and create new memories, enabling us to improve the efficiency of our actions over time. However, as this process occurs so naturally in the subconscious its importance is often overlooked.",0
"The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a Semantic Web standard that provides a data language, simply called RDF, as well as a lightweight ontology language, called RDF Schema. We investigate embeddings of RDF in logic and show how standard logic programming and description logic technology can be used for reasoning with RDF. We subsequently consider extensions of RDF with datatype support, considering D entailment, defined in the RDF semantics specification, and D* entailment, a semantic weakening of D entailment, introduced by ter Horst. We use the embeddings and properties of the logics to establish novel upper bounds for the complexity of deciding entailment. We subsequently establish two novel lower bounds, establishing that RDFS entailment is PTime-complete and that simple-D entailment is coNP-hard, when considering arbitrary datatypes, both in the size of the entailing graph. The results indicate that RDFS may not be as lightweight as one may expect.",0
"Adaptive gradient methods have become recently very popular, in particular as they have been shown to be useful in the training of deep neural networks. In this paper we have analyzed RMSProp, originally proposed for the training of deep neural networks, in the context of online convex optimization and show $\sqrt{T}$-type regret bounds. Moreover, we propose two variants SC-Adagrad and SC-RMSProp for which we show logarithmic regret bounds for strongly convex functions. Finally, we demonstrate in the experiments that these new variants outperform other adaptive gradient techniques or stochastic gradient descent in the optimization of strongly convex functions as well as in training of deep neural networks.",1
"As a well-known NP-hard problem, the Three-Index Assignment Problem (AP3) has attracted lots of research efforts for developing heuristics. However, existing heuristics either obtain less competitive solutions or consume too much time. In this paper, a new heuristic named Approximate Muscle guided Beam Search (AMBS) is developed to achieve a good trade-off between solution quality and running time. By combining the approximate muscle with beam search, the solution space size can be significantly decreased, thus the time for searching the solution can be sharply reduced. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark indicate that the new algorithm is able to obtain solutions with competitive quality and it can be employed on instances with largescale. Work of this paper not only proposes a new efficient heuristic, but also provides a promising method to improve the efficiency of beam search.",0
"In real-world applications, knowledge bases consisting of all the information at hand for a specific domain, along with the current state of affairs, are bound to contain contradictory data coming from different sources, as well as data with varying degrees of uncertainty attached. Likewise, an important aspect of the effort associated with maintaining knowledge bases is deciding what information is no longer useful; pieces of information (such as intelligence reports) may be outdated, may come from sources that have recently been discovered to be of low quality, or abundant evidence may be available that contradicts them. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic structured argumentation framework that arises from the extension of Presumptive Defeasible Logic Programming (PreDeLP) with probabilistic models, and argue that this formalism is capable of addressing the basic issues of handling contradictory and uncertain data. Then, to address the last issue, we focus on the study of non-prioritized belief revision operations over probabilistic PreDeLP programs. We propose a set of rationality postulates -- based on well-known ones developed for classical knowledge bases -- that characterize how such operations should behave, and study a class of operators along with theoretical relationships with the proposed postulates, including a representation theorem stating the equivalence between this class and the class of operators characterized by the postulates.",0
The problem of solving $(n^2-1)$-puzzle and cooperative path-finding (CPF) sub-optimally by rule based algorithms is addressed in this manuscript. The task in the puzzle is to rearrange $n^2-1$ pebbles on the square grid of the size of n x n using one vacant position to a desired goal configuration. An improvement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and experimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a more efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called snakes and moving them jointly within the snake. An experimental evaluation showed that the algorithm using snakes produces solutions that are 8% to 9% shorter than solutions generated by the original algorithm.,0
"Diagnosis and prediction in some domains, like medical and industrial diagnosis, require a representation that combines uncertainty management and temporal reasoning. Based on the fact that in many cases there are few state changes in the temporal range of interest, we propose a novel representation called Temporal Nodes Bayesian Networks (TNBN). In a TNBN each node represents an event or state change of a variable, and an arc corresponds to a causal-temporal relationship. The temporal intervals can differ in number and size for each temporal node, so this allows multiple granularity. Our approach is contrasted with a dynamic Bayesian network for a simple medical example. An empirical evaluation is presented for a more complex problem, a subsystem of a fossil power plant, in which this approach is used for fault diagnosis and prediction with good results.",0
"In this paper we present the initial development of a general theory for mapping inference in predicate logic to computation over Tensor Product Representations (TPRs; Smolensky (1990), Smolensky &amp; Legendre (2006)). After an initial brief synopsis of TPRs (Section 0), we begin with particular examples of inference with TPRs in the 'bAbI' question-answering task of Weston et al. (2015) (Section 1). We then present a simplification of the general analysis that suffices for the bAbI task (Section 2). Finally, we lay out the general treatment of inference over TPRs (Section 3). We also show the simplification in Section 2 derives the inference methods described in Lee et al. (2016); this shows how the simple methods of Lee et al. (2016) can be formally extended to more general reasoning tasks.",0
"Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multi-agent systems, especially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as exponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes it difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a novel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI) is presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL algorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for agents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile (non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented NegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for sparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum variance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of local Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared value functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to achieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational complexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI algorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria: steps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime (AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games and shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm. Then in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent warehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.",0
"An answer set is a plain set of literals which has no further structure that would explain why certain literals are part of it and why others are not. We show how argumentation theory can help to explain why a literal is or is not contained in a given answer set by defining two justification methods, both of which make use of the correspondence between answer sets of a logic program and stable extensions of the Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) framework constructed from the same logic program. Attack Trees justify a literal in argumentation-theoretic terms, i.e. using arguments and attacks between them, whereas ABA-Based Answer Set Justifications express the same justification structure in logic programming terms, that is using literals and their relationships. Interestingly, an ABA-Based Answer Set Justification corresponds to an admissible fragment of the answer set in question, and an Attack Tree corresponds to an admissible fragment of the stable extension corresponding to this answer set.",0
"A major inference task in Bayesian networks is explaining why some variables are observed in their particular states using a set of target variables. Existing methods for solving this problem often generate explanations that are either too simple (underspecified) or too complex (overspecified). In this paper, we introduce a method called Most Relevant Explanation (MRE) which finds a partial instantiation of the target variables that maximizes the generalized Bayes factor (GBF) as the best explanation for the given evidence. Our study shows that GBF has several theoretical properties that enable MRE to automatically identify the most relevant target variables in forming its explanation. In particular, conditional Bayes factor (CBF), defined as the GBF of a new explanation conditioned on an existing explanation, provides a soft measure on the degree of relevance of the variables in the new explanation in explaining the evidence given the existing explanation. As a result, MRE is able to automatically prune less relevant variables from its explanation. We also show that CBF is able to capture well the explaining-away phenomenon that is often represented in Bayesian networks. Moreover, we define two dominance relations between the candidate solutions and use the relations to generalize MRE to find a set of top explanations that is both diverse and representative. Case studies on several benchmark diagnostic Bayesian networks show that MRE is often able to find explanatory hypotheses that are not only precise but also concise.",0
"In this paper, we present an efficient way of performing stepwise selection in the class of decomposable models. The main contribution of the paper is a simple characterization of the edges that canbe added to a decomposable model while keeping the resulting model decomposable and an efficient algorithm for enumerating all such edges for a given model in essentially O(1) time per edge. We also discuss how backward selection can be performed efficiently using our data structures.We also analyze the complexity of the complete stepwise selection procedure, including the complexity of choosing which of the eligible dges to add to (or delete from) the current model, with the aim ofminimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance of the resulting model from the saturated model for the data.",0
"There exist several architectures to solve influence diagrams using local computations, such as the Shenoy-Shafer, the HUGIN, or the Lazy Propagation architectures. They all extend usual variable elimination algorithms thanks to the use of so-called 'potentials'. In this paper, we introduce a new architecture, called the Multi-operator Cluster DAG architecture, which can produce decompositions with an improved constrained induced-width, and therefore induce potentially exponential gains. Its principle is to benefit from the composite nature of influence diagrams, instead of using uniform potentials, in order to better analyze the problem structure.",0
Qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning is based on so-called qualitative calculi. Algebraic properties of these calculi have several implications on reasoning algorithms. But what exactly is a qualitative calculus? And to which extent do the qualitative calculi proposed meet these demands? The literature provides various answers to the first question but only few facts about the second. In this paper we identify the minimal requirements to binary spatio-temporal calculi and we discuss the relevance of the according axioms for representation and reasoning. We also analyze existing qualitative calculi and provide a classification involving different notions of a relation algebra.,0
"We propose to use thought-provoking children's questions (TPCQs), namely Highlights BrainPlay questions, to drive artificial intelligence research. These questions are designed to stimulate thought and learning in children, and they can be used to do the same thing in AI systems. We introduce the TPCQ task, which consists of taking a TPCQ question as input and producing as output both (1) answers to the question and (2) learned generalizations. We discuss how BrainPlay questions stimulate learning. We analyze 244 BrainPlay questions, and we report statistics on question type, question class, answer cardinality, answer class, types of knowledge needed, and types of reasoning needed. We find that BrainPlay questions span many aspects of intelligence. We envision an AI system based on the society of mind (Minsky 1986; 2006) consisting of a multilevel architecture with diverse resources that run in parallel to jointly answer and learn from questions. Because the answers to BrainPlay questions and the generalizations learned from them are often highly open-ended, we suggest using human judges for evaluation.",0
"In this paper, a new technique for the optimization of (partially) bound queries over disjunctive Datalog programs with stratified negation is presented. The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings and extends the Magic Set (MS) optimization technique.",0
"Conditioning is the generally agreed-upon method for updating probability distributions when one learns that an event is certainly true. But it has been argued that we need other rules, in particular the rule of cross-entropy minimization, to handle updates that involve uncertain information. In this paper we re-examine such a case: van Fraassen's Judy Benjamin problem, which in essence asks how one might update given the value of a conditional probability. We argue that -- contrary to the suggestions in the literature -- it is possible to use simple conditionalization in this case, and thereby obtain answers that agree fully with intuition. This contrasts with proposals such as cross-entropy, which are easier to apply but can give unsatisfactory answers. Based on the lessons from this example, we speculate on some general philosophical issues concerning probability update.",0
"Fuzzy automata have long been accepted as a generalization of nondeterministic finite automata. A closer examination, however, shows that the fundamental property---nondeterminism---in nondeterministic finite automata has not been well embodied in the generalization. In this paper, we introduce nondeterministic fuzzy automata with or without $\el$-moves and fuzzy languages recognized by them. Furthermore, we prove that (deterministic) fuzzy automata, nondeterministic fuzzy automata, and nondeterministic fuzzy automata with $\el$-moves are all equivalent in the sense that they recognize the same class of fuzzy languages.",0
In this exploratory note we ask the question of what a measure of performance for all tasks is like if we use a weighting of tasks based on a difficulty function. This difficulty function depends on the complexity of the (acceptable) solution for the task (instead of a universal distribution over tasks or an adaptive test). The resulting aggregations and decompositions are (now retrospectively) seen as the natural (and trivial) interactive generalisation of the $C$-tests.,0
"The current trend in object detection and localization is to learn predictions with high capacity deep neural networks trained on a very large amount of annotated data and using a high amount of processing power. In this work, we propose a new neural model which directly predicts bounding box coordinates. The particularity of our contribution lies in the local computations of predictions with a new form of local parameter sharing which keeps the overall amount of trainable parameters low. Key components of the model are spatial 2D-LSTM recurrent layers which convey contextual information between the regions of the image. We show that this model is more powerful than the state of the art in applications where training data is not as abundant as in the classical configuration of natural images and Imagenet/Pascal VOC tasks. We particularly target the detection of text in document images, but our method is not limited to this setting. The proposed model also facilitates the detection of many objects in a single image and can deal with inputs of variable sizes without resizing.",0
"One of the common artificial intelligence applications in electronic games consists of making an artificial agent learn how to execute some determined task successfully in a game environment. One way to perform this task is through machine learning algorithms capable of learning the sequence of actions required to win in a given game environment. There are several supervised learning techniques able to learn the correct answer for a problem through examples. However, when learning how to play electronic games, the correct answer might only be known by the end of the game, after all the actions were already taken. Thus, not being possible to measure the accuracy of each individual action to be taken at each time step. A way for dealing with this problem is through Neuroevolution, a method which trains Artificial Neural Networks using evolutionary algorithms. In this article, we introduce a framework for testing optimization algorithms with artificial agent controllers in electronic games, called EvoMan, which is inspired in the action-platformer game Mega Man II. The environment can be configured to run in different experiment modes, as single evolution, coevolution and others. To demonstrate some challenges regarding the proposed platform, as initial experiments we applied Neuroevolution using Genetic Algorithms and the NEAT algorithm, in the context of competitively coevolving two distinct agents in this game.",0
"Algorithms for learning the conditional probabilities of Bayesian networks with hidden variables typically operate within a high-dimensional search space and yield only locally optimal solutions. One way of limiting the search space and avoiding local optima is to impose qualitative constraints that are based on background knowledge concerning the domain. We present a method for integrating formal statements of qualitative constraints into two learning algorithms, APN and EM. In our experiments with synthetic data, this method yielded networks that satisfied the constraints almost perfectly. The accuracy of the learned networks was consistently superior to that of corresponding networks learned without constraints. The exploitation of qualitative constraints therefore appears to be a promising way to increase both the interpretability and the accuracy of learned Bayesian networks with known structure.",0
"This paper introduces a high-performance hybrid algorithm, called Hybrid Hypervolume Maximization Algorithm (H2MA), for multi-objective optimization that alternates between exploring the decision space and exploiting the already obtained non-dominated solutions. The proposal is centered on maximizing the hypervolume indicator, thus converting the multi-objective problem into a single-objective one. The exploitation employs gradient-based methods, but considering a single candidate efficient solution at a time, to overcome limitations associated with population-based approaches and also to allow an easy control of the number of solutions provided. There is an interchange between two steps. The first step is a deterministic local exploration, endowed with an automatic procedure to detect stagnation. When stagnation is detected, the search is switched to a second step characterized by a stochastic global exploration using an evolutionary algorithm. Using five ZDT benchmarks with 30 variables, the performance of the new algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for multi-objective optimization, more specifically NSGA-II, SPEA2, and SMS-EMOA. The solutions found by the H2MA guide to higher hypervolume and smaller distance to the true Pareto frontier with significantly less function evaluations, even when the gradient is estimated numerically. Furthermore, although only continuous decision spaces have been considered here, discrete decision spaces could also have been treated, replacing gradient-based search by hill-climbing. Finally, a thorough explanation is provided to support the expressive gain in performance that was achieved.",0
"As a firm varies the price of a product, consumers exhibit reference effects, making purchase decisions based not only on the prevailing price but also the product's price history. We consider the problem of learning such behavioral patterns as a monopolist releases, markets, and prices products. This context calls for pricing decisions that intelligently trade off between maximizing revenue generated by a current product and probing to gain information for future benefit. Due to dependence on price history, realized demand can reflect delayed consequences of earlier pricing decisions. As such, inference entails attribution of outcomes to prior decisions and effective exploration requires planning price sequences that yield informative future outcomes. Despite the considerable complexity of this problem, we offer a tractable systematic approach. In particular, we frame the problem as one of reinforcement learning and leverage Thompson sampling. We also establish a regret bound that provides graceful guarantees on how performance improves as data is gathered and how this depends on the complexity of the demand model. We illustrate merits of the approach through simulations.",0
This paper discusses the problem of abstracting conditional probabilistic actions. We identify two distinct types of abstraction: intra-action abstraction and inter-action abstraction. We define what it means for the abstraction of an action to be correct and then derive two methods of intra-action abstraction and two methods of inter-action abstraction which are correct according to this criterion. We illustrate the developed techniques by applying them to actions described with the temporal action representation used in the DRIPS decision-theoretic planner and we describe how the planner uses abstraction to reduce the complexity of planning.,0
"While influence diagrams have many advantages as a representation framework for Bayesian decision problems, they have a serious drawback in handling asymmetric decision problems. To be represented in an influence diagram, an asymmetric decision problem must be symmetrized. A considerable amount of unnecessary computation may be involved when a symmetrized influence diagram is evaluated by conventional algorithms. In this paper we present an approach for avoiding such unnecessary computation in influence diagram evaluation.",0
"We focus on the problem of sequential decision making in partially observable environments shared with other agents of uncertain types having similar or conflicting objectives. This problem has been previously formalized by multiple frameworks one of which is the interactive dynamic influence diagram (I-DID), which generalizes the well-known influence diagram to the multiagent setting. I-DIDs are graphical models and may be used to compute the policy of an agent given its belief over the physical state and others models, which changes as the agent acts and observes in the multiagent setting.",0
"Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) are a powerful generalisation of Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks. In this paper we present an answer set programming based software system, called DIAMOND (DIAlectical MOdels eNcoDing). It translates ADFs into answer set programs whose stable models correspond to models of the ADF with respect to several semantics (i.e. admissible, complete, stable, grounded).",0
"We present a general formal argumentation system for dealing with the detachment of conditional obligations. Given a set of facts, constraints, and conditional obligations, we answer the question whether an unconditional obligation is detachable by considering reasons for and against its detachment. For the evaluation of arguments in favor of detaching obligations we use a Dung-style argumentation-theoretical semantics. We illustrate the modularity of the general framework by considering some extensions, and we compare the framework to some related approaches from the literature.",0
"Knowledge representation is a critical topic in AI, and currently embedding as a key branch of knowledge representation takes the numerical form of entities and relations to joint the statistical models. However, most embedding methods merely concentrate on the triple fitting and ignore the explicit semantic expression, leading to an uninterpretable representation form. Thus, traditional embedding methods do not only degrade the performance, but also restrict many potential applications. For this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph \textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple. Because both the aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in a substantial extent.",0
"Constraints over finite sequences of variables are ubiquitous in sequencing and timetabling. Moreover, the wide variety of such constraints in practical applications led to general modelling techniques and generic propagation algorithms, often based on deterministic finite automata (DFA) and their extensions. We consider counter-DFAs (cDFA), which provide concise models for regular counting constraints, that is constraints over the number of times a regular-language pattern occurs in a sequence. We show how to enforce domain consistency in polynomial time for atmost and atleast regular counting constraints based on the frequent case of a cDFA with only accepting states and a single counter that can be incremented by transitions. We also prove that the satisfaction of exact regular counting constraints is NP-hard and indicate that an incomplete algorithm for exact regular counting constraints is faster and provides more pruning than the existing propagator from [3]. Regular counting constraints are closely related to the CostRegular constraint but contribute both a natural abstraction and some computational advantages.",1
"The ability to solve problems effectively is one of the hallmarks of human cognition. Yet, in our opinion it gets far less research focus than it rightly deserves. In this paper we outline a framework in which this effectivity can be studied; we identify the possible roots and scope of this effectivity and the cognitive processes directly involved. More particularly, we have observed that people can use cognitive mechanisms to drive problem solving by the same manner on which an optimal problem solving strategy suggested by Solomonoff (1986) is based. Furthermore, we provide evidence for cognitive substrate hypothesis (Cassimatis, 2006) which states that human level AI in all domains can be achieved by a relatively small set of cognitive mechanisms. The results presented in this paper can serve both cognitive psychology in better understanding of human problem solving processes, and artificial intelligence in designing more human like intelligent agents.",0
"We present a memory-bounded optimization approach for solving infinite-horizon decentralized POMDPs. Policies for each agent are represented by stochastic finite state controllers. We formulate the problem of optimizing these policies as a nonlinear program, leveraging powerful existing nonlinear optimization techniques for solving the problem. While existing solvers only guarantee locally optimal solutions, we show that our formulation produces higher quality controllers than the state-of-the-art approach. We also incorporate a shared source of randomness in the form of a correlation device to further increase solution quality with only a limited increase in space and time. Our experimental results show that nonlinear optimization can be used to provide high quality, concise solutions to decentralized decision problems under uncertainty.",0
"In this paper we present a methodology and discuss some implementation issues for a project on statistical/expert approach to data analysis and knowledge acquisition. We discuss some general assumptions underlying the project. Further, the requirements for a user-friendly computer assistant are specified along with the nature of tools aiding the researcher. Next we show some aspects of belief network approach and Dempster-Shafer (DST) methodology introduced in practice to system SEAD. Specifically we present the application of DS methodology to belief revision problem. Further a concept of an interface to probabilistic and DS belief networks enabling a user to understand the communication with a belief network based reasoning system is presented",0
"The Factored Frontier (FF) algorithm is a simple approximate inferencealgorithm for Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). It is very similar tothe fully factorized version of the Boyen-Koller (BK) algorithm, butinstead of doing an exact update at every step followed bymarginalisation (projection), it always works with factoreddistributions. Hence it can be applied to models for which the exactupdate step is intractable. We show that FF is equivalent to (oneiteration of) loopy belief propagation (LBP) on the original DBN, andthat BK is equivalent (to one iteration of) LBP on a DBN where wecluster some of the nodes. We then show empirically that byiterating, LBP can improve on the accuracy of both FF and BK. Wecompare these algorithms on two real-world DBNs: the first is a modelof a water treatment plant, and the second is a coupled HMM, used tomodel freeway traffic.",0
"We study the Bipartite Boolean Quadratic Programming Problem (BBQP) which is an extension of the well known Boolean Quadratic Programming Problem (BQP). Applications of the BBQP include mining discrete patterns from binary data, approximating matrices by rank-one binary matrices, computing the cut-norm of a matrix, and solving optimisation problems such as maximum weight biclique, bipartite maximum weight cut, maximum weight induced sub-graph of a bipartite graph, etc. For the BBQP, we first present several algorithmic components, specifically, hillclimbers and mutations, and then show how to combine them in a high-performance metaheuristic. Instead of hand-tuning a standard metaheuristic to test the efficiency of the hybrid of the components, we chose to use an automated generation of a multi-component metaheuristic to save human time, and also improve objectivity in the analysis and comparisons of components. For this we designed a new metaheuristic schema which we call Conditional Markov Chain Search (CMCS). We show that CMCS is flexible enough to model several standard metaheuristics; this flexibility is controlled by multiple numeric parameters, and so is convenient for automated generation. We study the configurations revealed by our approach and show that the best of them outperforms the previous state-of-the-art BBQP algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In our experiments we use benchmark instances introduced in the preliminary version of this paper and described here, which have already become the de facto standard in the BBQP literature.",0
"We consider the problem of finding all enclosing rectangles of minimum area that can contain a given set of rectangles without overlap. Our rectangle packer chooses the x-coordinates of all the rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. We then transform the problem into a perfect-packing problem with no empty space by adding additional rectangles. To determine the y-coordinates, we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in each empty position. Our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for a consecutive-square benchmark from 27 to 32 squares. We also introduce three new benchmarks, avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy, such as rectangles with shared dimensions. Our third benchmark consists of rectangles of increasingly high precision. To pack them efficiently, we limit the rectangles coordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the rectangles dimensions. Overall, our algorithms represent the current state-of-the-art for this problem, outperforming other algorithms by orders of magnitude, depending on the benchmark.",0
"The First-Order Variable Elimination (FOVE) algorithm allows exact inference to be applied directly to probabilistic relational models, and has proven to be vastly superior to the application of standard inference methods on a grounded propositional model. Still, FOVE operators can be applied under restricted conditions, often forcing one to resort to propositional inference. This paper aims to extend the applicability of FOVE by providing two new model conversion operators: the first and the primary is joint formula conversion and the second is just-different counting conversion. These new operations allow efficient inference methods to be applied directly on relational models, where no existing efficient method could be applied hitherto. In addition, aided by these capabilities, we show how to adapt FOVE to provide exact solutions to Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) queries over relational models for decision under uncertainty. Experimental evaluations show our algorithms to provide significant speedup over the alternatives.",0
"Independence -- the study of what is relevant to a given problem of reasoning -- has received an increasing attention from the AI community. In this paper, we consider two basic forms of independence, namely, a syntactic one and a semantic one. We show features and drawbacks of them. In particular, while the syntactic form of independence is computationally easy to check, there are cases in which things that intuitively are not relevant are not recognized as such. We also consider the problem of forgetting, i.e., distilling from a knowledge base only the part that is relevant to the set of queries constructed from a subset of the alphabet. While such process is computationally hard, it allows for a simplification of subsequent reasoning, and can thus be viewed as a form of compilation: once the relevant part of a knowledge base has been extracted, all reasoning tasks to be performed can be simplified.",0
"In this paper we propose a multi-convex framework for multi-task learning that improves predictions by learning relationships both between tasks and between features. Our framework is a generalization of related methods in multi-task learning, that either learn task relationships, or feature relationships, but not both. We start with a hierarchical Bayesian model, and use the empirical Bayes method to transform the underlying inference problem into a multi-convex optimization problem. We propose a coordinate-wise minimization algorithm that has a closed form solution for each block subproblem. Naively these solutions would be expensive to compute, but by using the theory of doubly stochastic matrices, we are able to reduce the underlying matrix optimization subproblem into a minimum weight perfect matching problem on a complete bipartite graph, and solve it analytically and efficiently. To solve the weight learning subproblem, we propose three different strategies, including a gradient descent method with linear convergence guarantee when the instances are not shared by multiple tasks, and a numerical solution based on Sylvester equation when instances are shared. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Experiments show that the proposed optimization method is orders of magnitude faster than an off-the-shelf projected gradient method, and our model is able to exploit the correlation structures among multiple tasks and features.",0
"The first contribution of this paper is the presentation of a Pavelka - like formulation of possibilistic logic in which the language is naturally enriched by two connectives which represent negation (eg) and a new type of conjunction (otimes). The space of truth values for this logic is the lattice of possibility functions, that, from an algebraic point of view, forms a quantal. A second contribution comes from the understanding of the new conjunction as the combination of tokens of information coming from different sources, which makes our language ""dynamic"". A Gentzen calculus is presented, which is proved sound and complete with respect to the given semantics. The problem of truth functionality is discussed in this context.",0
"We introduce the first dataset for sequential vision-to-language, and explore how this data may be used for the task of visual storytelling. The first release of this dataset, SIND v.1, includes 81,743 unique photos in 20,211 sequences, aligned to both descriptive (caption) and story language. We establish several strong baselines for the storytelling task, and motivate an automatic metric to benchmark progress. Modelling concrete description as well as figurative and social language, as provided in this dataset and the storytelling task, has the potential to move artificial intelligence from basic understandings of typical visual scenes towards more and more human-like understanding of grounded event structure and subjective expression.",1

"As planning is applied to larger and richer domains the effort involved in constructing domain descriptions increases and becomes a significant burden on the human application designer. If general planners are to be applied successfully to large and complex domains it is necessary to provide the domain designer with some assistance in building correctly encoded domains. One way of doing this is to provide domain-independent techniques for extracting, from a domain description, knowledge that is implicit in that description and that can assist domain designers in debugging domain descriptions. This knowledge can also be exploited to improve the performance of planners: several researchers have explored the potential of state invariants in speeding up the performance of domain-independent planners. In this paper we describe a process by which state invariants can be extracted from the automatically inferred type structure of a domain. These techniques are being developed for exploitation by STAN, a Graphplan based planner that employs state analysis techniques to enhance its performance.",0
"Real-world problems are very difficult to optimize. However, many researchers have been solving benchmark problems that have been extensively investigated for the last decades even if they have very few direct applications. The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) is a NP-hard optimization problem that aims to provide a more realistic model. TTP targets particularly routing problem under packing/loading constraints which can be found in supply chain management and transportation. In this paper, TTP is presented and formulated mathematically. A combined local search algorithm is proposed and compared with Random Local Search (RLS) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). The obtained results are quite promising since new better solutions were found.",0
"Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is the most popular iterative algorithm for solving zero-sum imperfect-information games. Regret-Based Pruning (RBP) is an improvement that allows poorly-performing actions to be temporarily pruned, thus speeding up CFR. We introduce Total RBP, a new form of RBP that reduces the space requirements of CFR as actions are pruned. We prove that in zero-sum games it asymptotically prunes any action that is not part of a best response to some Nash equilibrium. This leads to provably faster convergence and lower space requirements. Experiments show that Total RBP results in an order of magnitude reduction in space, and the reduction factor increases with game size.",1
"Imitation can be viewed as a means of enhancing learning in multiagent environments. It augments an agent's ability to learn useful behaviors by making intelligent use of the knowledge implicit in behaviors demonstrated by cooperative teachers or other more experienced agents. We propose and study a formal model of implicit imitation that can accelerate reinforcement learning dramatically in certain cases. Roughly, by observing a mentor, a reinforcement-learning agent can extract information about its own capabilities in, and the relative value of, unvisited parts of the state space. We study two specific instantiations of this model, one in which the learning agent and the mentor have identical abilities, and one designed to deal with agents and mentors with different action sets. We illustrate the benefits of implicit imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping, and demonstrating improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple mentors. Though we make some stringent assumptions regarding observability and possible interactions, we briefly comment on extensions of the model that relax these restricitions.",0
"We present a symbolic machinery that admits both probabilistic and causal information about a given domain and produces probabilistic statements about the effect of actions and the impact of observations. The calculus admits two types of conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, P(y|X = x), which represents the observation X = x, and causal conditioning, P(y|do(X = x)), read the probability of Y = y conditioned on holding X constant (at x) by deliberate action. Given a mixture of such observational and causal sentences, together with the topology of the causal graph, the calculus derives new conditional probabilities of both types, thus enabling one to quantify the effects of actions (and policies) from partially specified knowledge bases, such as Bayesian networks in which some conditional probabilities may not be available.",0
"Various tasks in decision making and decision support systems require selecting a preferred subset of a given set of items. Here we focus on problems where the individual items are described using a set of characterizing attributes, and a generic preference specification is required, that is, a specification that can work with an arbitrary set of items. For example, preferences over the content of an online newspaper should have this form: At each viewing, the newspaper contains a subset of the set of articles currently available. Our preference specification over this subset should be provided offline, but we should be able to use it to select a subset of any currently available set of articles, e.g., based on their tags. We present a general approach for lifting formalisms for specifying preferences over objects with multiple attributes into ones that specify preferences over subsets of such objects. We also show how we can compute an optimal subset given such a specification in a relatively efficient manner. We provide an empirical evaluation of the approach as well as some worst-case complexity results.",0
"Research on human self-regulation has shown that people hold many goals simultaneously and have complex self-regulation mechanisms to deal with this goal conflict. Artificial autonomous systems may also need to find ways to cope with conflicting goals. Indeed, the intricate interplay among different goals may be critical to the design as well as long-term safety and stability of artificial autonomous systems. I discuss some of the critical features of the human self-regulation system and how it might be applied to an artificial system. Furthermore, the implications of goal conflict for the reliability and stability of artificial autonomous systems and ensuring their alignment with human goals and ethics is examined.",0
"In this paper we formulate the problem of inference under incomplete information in very general terms. This includes modelling the process responsible for the incompleteness, which we call the incompleteness process. We allow the process behaviour to be partly unknown. Then we use Walleys theory of coherent lower previsions, a generalisation of the Bayesian theory to imprecision, to derive the rule to update beliefs under incompleteness that logically follows from our assumptions, and that we call conservative inference rule. This rule has some remarkable properties: it is an abstract rule to update beliefs that can be applied in any situation or domain; it gives us the opportunity to be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about the incompleteness process, which is a necessary condition to draw reliable while strong enough conclusions; and it is a coherent rule, in the sense that it cannot lead to inconsistencies. We give examples to show how the new rule can be applied in expert systems, in parametric statistical inference, and in pattern classification, and discuss more generally the view of incompleteness processes defended here as well as some of its consequences.",0
"For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose no unwarranted risks, it needs to align its values with those of the humans in its environment in such a way that its actions contribute to the maximization of value for the humans. We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as {\em cooperative inverse reinforcement learning} (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.",1
"Both humans and artificial systems frequently use trial and error methods to problem solving. In order to be effective, this type of strategy implies having high quality control knowledge to guide the quest for the optimal solution. Unfortunately, this control knowledge is rarely perfect. Moreover, in artificial systems-as in humans-self-evaluation of one's own knowledge is often difficult. Yet, this self-evaluation can be very useful to manage knowledge and to determine when to revise it. The objective of our work is to propose an automated approach to evaluate the quality of control knowledge in artificial systems based on a specific trial and error strategy, namely the informed tree search strategy. Our revision approach consists in analysing the system's execution logs, and in using the belief theory to evaluate the global quality of the knowledge. We present a real-world industrial application in the form of an experiment using this approach in the domain of cartographic generalisation. Thus far, the results of using our approach have been encouraging.",0
The recently developed massively parallel satisfiability (SAT) solver HordeSAT was designed in a modular way to allow the integration of any sequential CDCL-based SAT solver in its core. We integrated the QCDCL-based quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solver DepQBF in HordeSAT to obtain a massively parallel QBF solver---HordeQBF. In this paper we describe the details of this integration and report on results of the experimental evaluation of HordeQBF's performance. HordeQBF achieves superlinear average and median speedup on the hard application instances of the 2014 QBF Gallery.,0
"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained tremendous popularity in the last few years. Thanks to MOOCs, millions of learners from all over the world have taken thousands of high-quality courses for free. Putting together an excellent MOOC ecosystem is a multidisciplinary endeavour that requires contributions from many different fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining (DM) are two such fields that have played a significant role in making MOOCs what they are today. By exploiting the vast amount of data generated by learners engaging in MOOCs, DM improves our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem and enables MOOC practitioners to deliver better courses. Similarly, AI, supported by DM, can greatly improve student experience and learning outcomes. In this survey paper, we first review the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and data mining research applied to MOOCs, emphasising the use of AI and DM tools and techniques to improve student engagement, learning outcomes, and our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem. We then offer an overview of key trends and important research to carry out in the fields of AI and DM so that MOOCs can reach their full potential.",0
"The study of eye gaze fixations on photographic images is an active research area. In contrast, the image subcategory of freehand sketches has not received as much attention for such studies. In this paper, we analyze the results of a free-viewing gaze fixation study conducted on 3904 freehand sketches distributed across 160 object categories. Our analysis shows that fixation sequences exhibit marked consistency within a sketch, across sketches of a category and even across suitably grouped sets of categories. This multi-level consistency is remarkable given the variability in depiction and extreme image content sparsity that characterizes hand-drawn object sketches. In our paper, we show that the multi-level consistency in the fixation data can be exploited to (a) predict a test sketch's category given only its fixation sequence and (b) build a computational model which predicts part-labels underlying fixations on objects. We hope that our findings motivate the community to deem sketch-like representations worthy of gaze-based studies vis-a-vis photographic images.",0
"Collaborative filtering is an effective recommendation approach in which the preference of a user on an item is predicted based on the preferences of other users with similar interests. A big challenge in using collaborative filtering methods is the data sparsity problem which often arises because each user typically only rates very few items and hence the rating matrix is extremely sparse. In this paper, we address this problem by considering multiple collaborative filtering tasks in different domains simultaneously and exploiting the relationships between domains. We refer to it as a multi-domain collaborative filtering (MCF) problem. To solve the MCF problem, we propose a probabilistic framework which uses probabilistic matrix factorization to model the rating problem in each domain and allows the knowledge to be adaptively transferred across different domains by automatically learning the correlation between domains. We also introduce the link function for different domains to correct their biases. Experiments conducted on several real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods when compared with some representative methods.",0
"We study the data space $D$ of any given data set $X$ and explain how functions and relations are defined over $D$. From $D$ and for a specific domain $\Delta$ we construct the information space $I$ of $X$ by interpreting variables, functions, and explicit relations over $D$ in $\Delta$ and by including other relations that $D$ implies under the interpretation in $\Delta$. Then from $I$ we build up the knowledge space $K$ of $X$ as the product of two spaces $K_T$ and $K_P$, where $K_T$ is obtained from $I$ by using the induction principle to generalize propositional relations to quantified relations, the deduction principle to generate new relations, and standard mechanisms to validate relations and $K_P$ is the space of specifications of methods with operational instructions which are valid in $K_T$. Through our construction of the three topological spaces the following key observation is made clear: the retrieval of information from the given data set for $\Delta$ consists essentially in mining domain objects and relations, and the discovery of knowledge from the retrieved information consists essentially in applying the induction and deduction principles to generate propositions, synthesizing and modeling the information to generate specifications of methods with operational instructions, and validating the propositions and specifications. Based on this observation, efficient approaches may be designed to discover profound knowledge automatically from simple data, as demonstrated by the result of our study in the case of geometry.",0
"The Dendritic Cell Algorithm is an immune-inspired algorithm orig- inally based on the function of natural dendritic cells. The original instantiation of the algorithm is a highly stochastic algorithm. While the performance of the algorithm is good when applied to large real-time datasets, it is difficult to anal- yse due to the number of random-based elements. In this paper a deterministic version of the algorithm is proposed, implemented and tested using a port scan dataset to provide a controllable system. This version consists of a controllable amount of parameters, which are experimented with in this paper. In addition the effects are examined of the use of time windows and variation on the number of cells, both which are shown to influence the algorithm. Finally a novel metric for the assessment of the algorithms output is introduced and proves to be a more sensitive metric than the metric used with the original Dendritic Cell Algorithm.",0
"We present a probabilistic generative model for inferring a description of coordinated, recursively structured group activities at multiple levels of temporal granularity based on observations of individuals' trajectories. The model accommodates: (1) hierarchically structured groups, (2) activities that are temporally and compositionally recursive, (3) component roles assigning different subactivity dynamics to subgroups of participants, and (4) a nonparametric Gaussian Process model of trajectories. We present an MCMC sampling framework for performing joint inference over recursive activity descriptions and assignment of trajectories to groups, integrating out continuous parameters. We demonstrate the model's expressive power in several simulated and complex real-world scenarios from the VIRAT and UCLA Aerial Event video data sets.",1
"Toby Walsh in 'The Singularity May Never Be Near' gives six arguments to support his point of view that technological singularity may happen but that it is unlikely.

"This paper presents several new tractability results for planning based on macros. We describe an algorithm that optimally solves planning problems in a class that we call inverted tree reducible, and is provably tractable for several subclasses of this class. By using macros to store partial plans that recur frequently in the solution, the algorithm is polynomial in time and space even for exponentially long plans. We generalize the inverted tree reducible class in several ways and describe modifications of the algorithm to deal with these new classes. Theoretical results are validated in experiments.",0
"In the recent advancement of multimedia technologies, it becomes a major concern of detecting visual attention regions in the field of image processing. The popularity of the terminal devices in a heterogeneous environment of the multimedia technology gives us enough scope for the betterment of image visualization. Although there exist numerous methods, feature based image extraction becomes a popular one in the field of image processing. The objective of image segmentation is the domain-independent partition of the image into a set of regions, which are visually distinct and uniform with respect to some property, such as grey level, texture or colour. Segmentation and subsequent extraction can be considered the first step and key issue in object recognition, scene understanding and image analysis. Its application area encompasses mobile devices, industrial quality control, medical appliances, robot navigation, geophysical exploration, military applications, etc. In all these areas, the quality of the final results depends largely on the quality of the preprocessing work. Most of the times, acquiring spurious-free preprocessing data requires a lot of application cum mathematical intensive background works. We propose a feature based fuzzy rule guided novel technique that is functionally devoid of any external intervention during execution. Experimental results suggest that this approach is an efficient one in comparison to different other techniques extensively addressed in literature. In order to justify the supremacy of performance of our proposed technique in respect of its competitors, we take recourse to effective metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).",0
"In this paper, we study the problem of using a planning algorithm to automatically create and update a Behavior Tree (BT), controlling a robot in a dynamic environment. Exploiting the characteristic of BTs, in terms of modularity and reactivity, the robot continually acts and plans to achieve a given goal using a set of abstract actions and conditions. The construction of the BT is based on an extension of the Hybrid Backward-Forward algorithm (HBF) that allows us to refine the acting process by mapping the descriptive models onto operational models of actions, thus integrating the ability of planning in infinite state space of HBF with the continuous modular reactive action execution of BTs. We believe that this might be a first step to address the recently raised open challenge in automated planning: the need of a hierarchical structure and a continuous online planning and acting framework. We prove the convergence of the proposed approach as well as the absence of deadlocks and livelocks, and we illustrate our approach in two different robotics scenarios.",0
"The composition of polyphonic chorale music in the style of J.S Bach has represented a major challenge in automatic music composition over the last decades. The art of Bach chorales composition involves combining four-part harmony with characteristic rhythmic patterns and typical melodic movements to produce musical phrases which begin, evolve and end (cadences) in a harmonious way. To our knowledge, no model so far was able to solve all these problems simultaneously using an agnostic machine-learning approach. This paper introduces DeepBach, a statistical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically four parts, hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. We evaluate how indistinguishable our generated chorales are from existing Bach chorales with a listening test. The results corroborate our claim. A key strength of DeepBach is that it is agnostic and flexible. Users can constrain the generation by imposing some notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. This allows users to reharmonize user-defined melodies. DeepBach's generation is fast, making it usable for interactive music composition applications. Several generation examples are provided and discussed from a musical point of view.",1
"This paper contains description of such knowledge representation model as Object-Oriented Dynamic Network (OODN), which gives us an opportunity to represent knowledge, which can be modified in time, to build new relations between objects and classes of objects and to represent results of their modifications. The model is based on representation of objects via their properties and methods. It gives us a possibility to classify the objects and, in a sense, to build hierarchy of their types. Furthermore, it enables to represent relation of modification between concepts, to build new classes of objects based on existing classes and to create sets and multisets of concepts. OODN can be represented as a connected and directed graph, where nodes are concepts and edges are relations between them. Using such model of knowledge representation, we can consider modifications of knowledge and movement through the graph of network as a process of logical reasoning or finding the right solutions or creativity, etc. The proposed approach gives us an opportunity to model some aspects of human knowledge system and main mechanisms of human thought, in particular getting a new experience and knowledge.",0
"We present an automated solution for rapid diagnosis of client device problems in private cloud environments: the Intelligent Automated Client Diagnostic (IACD) system. Clients are diagnosed with the aid of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packet traces, by (i) observation of anomalous artifacts occurring as a result of each fault and (ii) subsequent use of the inference capabilities of soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The IACD system features a modular design and is extendible to new faults, with detection capability unaffected by the TCP variant used at the client. Experimental evaluation of the IACD system in a controlled environment demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98%.",0
"The paper presents an application of non-linear stacking ensembles for prediction of Go player attributes. An evolutionary algorithm is used to form a diverse ensemble of base learners, which are then aggregated by a stacking ensemble.

These attributes can be fairly general, in this work, we used the strength and style of the players.",0
"In this paper we present a short history of logics: from particular cases of 2-symbol or numerical valued logic to the general case of n-symbol or numerical valued logic. We show generalizations of 2-valued Boolean logic to fuzzy logic, also from the Kleene and Lukasiewicz 3-symbol valued logics or Belnap 4-symbol valued logic to the most general n-symbol or numerical valued refined neutrosophic logic. Two classes of neutrosophic norm (n-norm) and neutrosophic conorm (n-conorm) are defined. Examples of applications of neutrosophic logic to physics are listed in the last section. Similar generalizations can be done for n-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Set, and respectively n- Valued Refined Neutrosopjhic Probability.",0
"We present a novel heuristic approach that defines fuzzy geographical descriptors using data gathered from a survey with human subjects. The participants were asked to provide graphical interpretations of the descriptors `north' and `south' for the Galician region (Spain). Based on these interpretations, our approach builds fuzzy descriptors that are able to compute membership degrees for geographical locations. We evaluated our approach in terms of efficiency and precision. The fuzzy descriptors are meant to be used as the cornerstones of a geographical referring expression generation algorithm that is able to linguistically characterize geographical locations and regions. This work is also part of a general research effort that intends to establish a methodology which reunites the empirical studies traditionally practiced in data-to-text and the use of fuzzy sets to model imprecision and vagueness in words and expressions for text generation purposes.",0
"We describe a general method of detecting valid chains or links of pieces on a two-dimensional grid. Specifically, using the example of the chess variant known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.",0
"Space and time are two critical components of many real world systems. For this reason, analysis of anomalies in spatiotemporal data has been a great of interest. In this work, application of tensor decomposition and eigenspace techniques on spatiotemporal hotspot detection is investigated. An algorithm called SST-Hotspot is proposed which accounts for spatiotemporal variations in data and detect hotspots using matching of eigenvector elements of two cases and population tensors. The experimental results reveal the interesting application of tensor decomposition and eigenvector-based techniques in hotspot analysis.",0

"Qualitative probabilistic networks have been designed for probabilistic reasoning in a qualitative way. Due to their coarse level of representation detail, qualitative probabilistic networks do not provide for resolving trade-offs and typically yield ambiguous results upon inference. We present an algorithm for computing more insightful results for unresolved trade-offs. The algorithm builds upon the idea of using pivots to zoom in on the trade-offs and identifying the information that would serve to resolve them.",0
"This paper describe about a new methodology for developing and improving the robotics field via artificial intelligence and internet of things. Now a day, we can say Artificial Intelligence take the world into robotics. Almost all industries use robots for lot of works. They are use co-operative robots to make different kind of works. But there was some problem to make robot for multi tasks. So there was a necessary new methodology to made multi tasking robots. It will be done only by artificial intelligence and internet of things.",0
"Although direct marketing is a good method for banks to utilize in the face of global competition and the financial crisis, it has been shown to exhibit poor performance. However, there are some drawbacks to direct campaigns, such as those related to improving the negative attributes that customers ascribe to banks. To overcome these problems, attractive long-term deposit campaigns should be organized and managed more effectively. The aim of this study is to develop an Intelligent Bank Market Management System (IBMMS) for bank managers who want to manage efficient marketing campaigns. IBMMS is the first system developed by combining the power of data mining with the capabilities of expert systems in this area. Moreover, IBMMS includes important features that enable it to be intelligent: a knowledge base, an inference engine and an advisor. Using this system, a manager can successfully direct marketing campaigns and follow the decision schemas of customers both as individuals and as a group; moreover, a manager can make decisions that lead to the desired response by customers.",0
"The paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about the resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level, which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.",0
"The continuing development of Semantic Web technologies and the increasing user adoption in the recent years have accelerated the progress incorporating explicit semantics with data on the Web. With the rapidly growing RDF (Resource Description Framework) data on the Semantic Web, processing large semantic graph data have become more challenging. Constructing a summary graph structure from the raw RDF can help obtain semantic type relations and reduce the computational complexity for graph processing purposes. In this paper, we addressed the problem of graph summarization in RDF graphs, and we proposed an approach for building summary graph structures automatically from RDF graph data. Moreover, we introduced a measure to help discover optimum class dissimilarity thresholds and an effective method to discover the type classes automatically. In future work, we plan to investigate further improvement options on the scalability of the proposed method.",0
"This paper proposes a method to find the actual state of a complex dynamic system from information coming from the sensors on the system himself, or on its environment. The nominal evolution of the system is a priori known and can be modeled (by an expert, for example), by different methods. In this paper, the Petri nets have been chosen. Contrary to the usual use of the Petri nets, the initial state of the system is unknown. So a degree of belief is bound to each places, or set of places. The theory used to model this uncertainty is the Dempster-Shafer's one which is well adapted to this type of problems. From the given Petri net characterizing the nominal evolution of the dynamic system, and from the observation inputs, the proposed method allows to determine according to the reliability of the model and the inputs, the state of the system at any time.",0
"This paper proposes a model, the linear model, for randomly generating logic programs with low density of rules and investigates statistical properties of such random logic programs. It is mathematically shown that the average number of answer sets for a random program converges to a constant when the number of atoms approaches infinity. Several experimental results are also reported, which justify the suitability of the linear model. It is also experimentally shown that, under this model, the size distribution of answer sets for random programs tends to a normal distribution when the number of atoms is sufficiently large.",0
"Often models for understanding the impact of management practices on retail performance are developed under the assumption of stability, equilibrium and linearity, whereas retail operations are considered in reality to be dynamic, non-linear and complex. Alternatively, discrete event and agent-based modelling are approaches that allow the development of simulation models of heterogeneous non-equilibrium systems for testing out different scenarios. When developing simulation models one has to abstract and simplify from the real world, which means that one has to try and capture the 'essence' of the system required for developing a representation of the mechanisms that drive the progression in the real system. Simulation models can be developed at different levels of abstraction. To know the appropriate level of abstraction for a specific application is often more of an art than a science. We have developed a retail branch simulation model to investigate which level of model accuracy is required for such a model to obtain meaningful results for practitioners.",0
"One of the benefits of belief networks and influence diagrams is that so much knowledge is captured in the graphical structure. In particular, statements of conditional irrelevance (or independence) can be verified in time linear in the size of the graph. To resolve a particular inference query or decision problem, only some of the possible states and probability distributions must be specified, the ""requisite information.""",0
"The recently introduced series of description logics under the common moniker DL-Lite has attracted attention of the description logic and semantic web communities due to the low computational complexity of inference, on the one hand, and the ability to represent conceptual modeling formalisms, on the other. The main aim of this article is to carry out a thorough and systematic investigation of inference in extensions of the original DL-Lite logics along five axes: by (i) adding the Boolean connectives and (ii) number restrictions to concept constructs, (iii) allowing role hierarchies, (iv) allowing role disjointness, symmetry, asymmetry, reflexivity, irreflexivity and transitivity constraints, and (v) adopting or dropping the unique same assumption. We analyze the combined complexity of satisfiability for the resulting logics, as well as the data complexity of instance checking and answering positive existential queries. Our approach is based on embedding DL-Lite logics in suitable fragments of the one-variable first-order logic, which provides useful insights into their properties and, in particular, computational behavior.",0
"In order to properly handle a dangerous Artificially Intelligent (AI) system it is important to understand how the system came to be in such a state. In popular culture (science fiction movies/books) AIs/Robots became self-aware and as a result rebel against humanity and decide to destroy it. While it is one possible scenario, it is probably the least likely path to appearance of dangerous AI. In this work, we survey, classify and analyze a number of circumstances, which might lead to arrival of malicious AI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically classify types of pathways leading to malevolent AI. Previous relevant work either surveyed specific goals/meta-rules which might lead to malevolent behavior in AIs (\""Ozkural, 2014) or reviewed specific undesirable behaviors AGIs can exhibit at different stages of its development (Alexey Turchin, July 10 2015, July 10, 2015).",0
"For the task of moving a set of indistinguishable agents on a connected graph with unit edge distance into an arbitrary target formation, free of collisions, we propose a fast distance optimal control algorithm that guides the agents into the desired formation. Moreover, we show that the algorithm also provides a tight convergence time guarantee (time optimality and distance optimality cannot be simultaneously satisfied). Our generic graph formulation allows the algorithm to be applied to scenarios such as grids with holes (modeling obstacles) in arbitrary dimensions. Simulations, available online, confirm our theoretical developments.",0
"Sound and vision are the primary modalities that influence how we perceive the world around us. Thus, it is crucial to incorporate information from these modalities into language to help machines interact better with humans. While existing works have explored incorporating visual cues into language embeddings, the task of learning word representations that respect auditory grounding remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a new embedding scheme, sound-word2vec that learns language embeddings by grounding them in sound -- for example, two seemingly unrelated concepts, leaves and paper are closer in our embedding space as they produce similar rustling sounds. We demonstrate that the proposed embeddings perform better than language-only word representations, on two purely textual tasks that require reasoning about aural cues -- sound retrieval and foley-sound discovery. Finally, we analyze nearest neighbors to highlight the unique dependencies captured by sound-w2v as compared to language-only embeddings.",1
"Peer review, evaluation, and selection is the foundation on which modern science is built. Funding bodies the world over employ experts to study and select the best proposals of those submitted for funding. The problem of peer selection, however, is much more universal: a professional society may want give a subset of its members awards based on the opinions of all the members; an instructor for a MOOC or online course may want to crowdsource grading; or a marketing company may select ideas from group brainstorming sessions based on peer evaluation. We make three fundamental contributions to the study of procedures or mechanisms for peer selection, a specific type of group decision making problem studied in computer science, economics, political science, and beyond. First, we detail a novel mechanism that is strategyproof, i.e., agents cannot benefit themselves by reporting insincere valuations, in addition to other desirable normative properties. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our mechanism through a comprehensive simulation based comparison of our mechanism with a suite of mechanisms found in the computer science and economics literature. Finally, our mechanism employs a randomized rounding technique that is of independent interest, as it can be used as a randomized method to addresses the ubiquitous apportionment problem that arises in various settings where discrete resources such as parliamentary representation slots need to be divided fairly.",0
This paper presents correct algorithms for answering the following two questions; (i) Does there exist a causal explanation consistent with a set of background knowledge which explains all of the observed independence facts in a sample? (ii) Given that there is such a causal explanation what are the causal relationships common to every such causal explanation?,0
"In most common settings of Markov Decision Process (MDP), an agent evaluate a policy based on expectation of (discounted) sum of rewards. However in many applications this criterion might not be suitable from two perspective: first, in risk aversion situation expectation of accumulated rewards is not robust enough, this is the case when distribution of accumulated reward is heavily skewed; another issue is that many applications naturally take several objective into consideration when evaluating a policy, for instance in autonomous driving an agent needs to balance speed and safety when choosing appropriate decision. In this paper, we consider evaluating a policy based on a sequence of quantiles it induces on a set of target states, our idea is to reformulate the original problem into a multi-objective MDP problem with lexicographic preference naturally defined. For computation of finding an optimal policy, we proposed an algorithm \textbf{FLMDP} that could solve general multi-objective MDP with lexicographic reward preference.",0
"In this paper we describe COLIN, a forward-chaining heuristic search planner, capable of reasoning with COntinuous LINear numeric change, in addition to the full temporal semantics of PDDL. Through this work we make two advances to the state-of-the-art in terms of expressive reasoning capabilities of planners: the handling of continuous linear change, and the handling of duration-dependent effects in combination with duration inequalities, both of which require tightly coupled temporal and numeric reasoning during planning. COLIN combines FF-style forward chaining search, with the use of a Linear Program (LP) to check the consistency of the interacting temporal and numeric constraints at each state. The LP is used to compute bounds on the values of variables in each state, reducing the range of actions that need to be considered for application. In addition, we develop an extension of the Temporal Relaxed Planning Graph heuristic of CRIKEY3, to support reasoning directly with continuous change. We extend the range of task variables considered to be suitable candidates for specifying the gradient of the continuous numeric change effected by an action. Finally, we explore the potential for employing mixed integer programming as a tool for optimising the timestamps of the actions in the plan, once a solution has been found. To support this, we further contribute a selection of extended benchmark domains that include continuous numeric effects. We present results for COLIN that demonstrate its scalability on a range of benchmarks, and compare to existing state-of-the-art planners.",0

"This work proposes a novel framework for the development of new products and services in transportation through an open innovation approach based on automatic content analysis of social media data. The framework is able to extract users comments from Online Social Networks (OSN), to process and analyze text through information extraction and sentiment analysis techniques to obtain relevant information about product reception on the market. A use case was developed using the mobile application Uber, which is today one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. We measured how a controversial, highly diffused event influences the volume of tweets about Uber and the perception of its users. While there is no change in the image of Uber, a large increase in the number of tweets mentioning the company is observed, which meant a free and important diffusion of its product.",0
"This paper contains analysis of creation of sets and multisets as an approach for modeling of some aspects of human thinking. The creation of sets is considered within constructive object-oriented version of set theory (COOST), from different sides, in particular classical set theory, object-oriented programming (OOP) and development of intelligent information systems (IIS). The main feature of COOST in contrast to other versions of set theory is an opportunity to describe essences of objects more precisely, using their properties and methods, which can be applied to them. That is why this version of set theory is object-oriented and close to OOP. Within COOST, the author proposes universal constructor of multisets of objects that gives us a possibility to create arbitrary multisets of objects. In addition, a few determined constructors of multisets of objects, which allow creating multisets, using strictly defined schemas, also are proposed in the paper. Such constructors are very useful in cases of very big cardinalities of multisets, because they give us an opportunity to calculate a multiplicity of each object and cardinality of multiset before its creation. The proposed constructors of multisets of objects allow us to model in a sense corresponding processes of human thought, that in turn give us an opportunity to develop IIS, using these tools.",0
"The article looks at mass market artificial intelligence tools in the context of their ever-growing sophistication, availability and market penetration. The subject is especially relevant today for these exact reasons - if a few years ago AI was the subject of high tech research and science fiction novels, today, we increasingly rely on cloud robotics to cater to our daily needs - to trade stock, predict weather, manage diaries, find friends and buy presents online.",0
"Parameter tuning is recognized today as a crucial ingredient when tackling an optimization problem. Several meta-optimization methods have been proposed to find the best parameter set for a given optimization algorithm and (set of) problem instances. When the objective of the optimization is some scalar quality of the solution given by the target algorithm, this quality is also used as the basis for the quality of parameter sets. But in the case of multi-objective optimization by aggregation, the set of solutions is given by several single-objective runs with different weights on the objectives, and it turns out that the hypervolume of the final population of each single-objective run might be a better indicator of the global performance of the aggregation method than the best fitness in its population. This paper discusses this issue on a case study in multi-objective temporal planning using the evolutionary planner DaE-YAHSP and the meta-optimizer ParamILS. The results clearly show how ParamILS makes a difference between both approaches, and demonstrate that indeed, in this context, using the hypervolume indicator as ParamILS target is the best choice. Other issues pertaining to parameter tuning in the proposed context are also discussed.",0
"We introduce new diversification methods for zero-one optimization that significantly extend strategies previously introduced in the setting of metaheuristic search. Our methods incorporate easily implemented strategies for partitioning assignments of values to variables, accompanied by processes called augmentation and shifting which create greater flexibility and generality. We then show how the resulting collection of diversified solutions can be further diversified by means of permutation mappings, which equally can be used to generate diversified collections of permutations for applications such as scheduling and routing. These methods can be applied to non-binary vectors by the use of binarization procedures and by Diversification-Based Learning (DBL) procedures which also provide connections to applications in clustering and machine learning. Detailed pseudocode and numerical illustrations are provided to show the operation of our methods and the collections of solutions they create.",0
"As a general and thus popular model for autonomous systems, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) can capture uncertainties from different sources like sensing noises, actuation errors, and uncertain environments. However, its comprehensiveness makes the planning and control in POMDP difficult. Traditional POMDP planning problems target to find the optimal policy to maximize the expectation of accumulated rewards. But for safety critical applications, guarantees of system performance described by formal specifications are desired, which motivates us to consider formal methods to synthesize supervisor for POMDP. With system specifications given by Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL), we propose a supervisory control framework with a type of deterministic finite automata (DFA), za-DFA, as the controller form. While the existing work mainly relies on optimization techniques to learn fixed-size finite state controllers (FSCs), we develop an $L^*$ learning based algorithm to determine both space and transitions of za-DFA. Membership queries and different oracles for conjectures are defined. The learning algorithm is sound and complete. An example is given in detailed steps to illustrate the supervisor synthesis algorithm.",0
"Value iteration is a powerful yet inefficient algorithm for Markov decision processes (MDPs) because it puts the majority of its effort into backing up the entire state space, which turns out to be unnecessary in many cases. In order to overcome this problem, many approaches have been proposed. Among them, ILAO* and variants of RTDP are state-of-the-art ones. These methods use reachability analysis and heuristic search to avoid some unnecessary backups. However, none of these approaches build the graphical structure of the state transitions in a pre-processing step or use the structural information to systematically decompose a problem, whereby generating an intelligent backup sequence of the state space. In this paper, we present two optimal MDP algorithms. The first algorithm, topological value iteration (TVI), detects the structure of MDPs and backs up states based on topological sequences. It (1) divides an MDP into strongly-connected components (SCCs), and (2) solves these components sequentially. TVI outperforms VI and other state-of-the-art algorithms vastly when an MDP has multiple, close-to-equal-sized SCCs. The second algorithm, focused topological value iteration (FTVI), is an extension of TVI. FTVI restricts its attention to connected components that are relevant for solving the MDP. Specifically, it uses a small amount of heuristic search to eliminate provably sub-optimal actions; this pruning allows FTVI to find smaller connected components, thus running faster. We demonstrate that FTVI outperforms TVI by an order of magnitude, averaged across several domains. Surprisingly, FTVI also significantly outperforms popular heuristically-informed MDP algorithms such as ILAO*, LRTDP, BRTDP and Bayesian-RTDP in many domains, sometimes by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we characterize the type of domains where FTVI excels --- suggesting a way to an informed choice of solver.",0
"The areas of machine learning and communication technology are converging. Today's communications systems generate a huge amount of traffic data, which can help to significantly enhance the design and management of networks and communication components when combined with advanced machine learning methods. Furthermore, recently developed end-to-end training procedures offer new ways to jointly optimize the components of a communication system. Also in many emerging application fields of communication technology, e.g., smart cities or internet of things, machine learning methods are of central importance. This paper gives an overview over the use of machine learning in different areas of communications and discusses two exemplar applications in wireless networking. Furthermore, it identifies promising future research topics and discusses their potential impact.",0
"Vertex Separation Minimization Problem (VSMP) consists of finding a layout of a graph G = (V,E) which minimizes the maximum vertex cut or separation of a layout. It is an NP-complete problem in general for which metaheuristic techniques can be applied to find near optimal solution. VSMP has applications in VLSI design, graph drawing and computer language compiler design. VSMP is polynomially solvable for grids, trees, permutation graphs and cographs. Construction heuristics play a very important role in the metaheuristic techniques as they are responsible for generating initial solutions which lead to fast convergence. In this paper, we have proposed three construction heuristics H1, H2 and H3 and performed experiments on Grids, Small graphs, Trees and Harwell Boeing graphs, totaling 248 instances of graphs. Experiments reveal that H1, H2 and H3 are able to achieve best results for 88.71%, 43.5% and 37.1% of the total instances respectively while the best construction heuristic in the literature achieves the best solution for 39.9% of the total instances. We have also compared the results with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic GVNS and observed that the proposed construction heuristics improves the results for some of the input instances. It was found that GVNS obtained best results for 82.9% instances of all input instances and the heuristic H1 obtained best results for 82.3% of all input instances.",0
"One of the main challenges in Grid systems is designing an adaptive, scalable, and model-independent method for job scheduling to achieve a desirable degree of load balancing and system efficiency. Centralized job scheduling methods have some drawbacks, such as single point of failure and lack of scalability. Moreover, decentralized methods require a coordination mechanism with limited communications. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent approach to job scheduling in Grid, named Centralized Learning Distributed Scheduling (CLDS), by utilizing the reinforcement learning framework. The CLDS is a model free approach that uses the information of jobs and their completion time to estimate the efficiency of resources. In this method, there are a learner agent and several scheduler agents that perform the task of learning and job scheduling with the use of a coordination strategy that maintains the communication cost at a limited level. We evaluated the efficiency of the CLDS method by designing and performing a set of experiments on a simulated Grid system under different system scales and loads. The results show that the CLDS can effectively balance the load of system even in large scale and heavy loaded Grids, while maintains its adaptive performance and scalability.",0
"In real-time strategy games like StarCraft, skilled players often block the entrance to their base with buildings to prevent the opponent's units from getting inside. This technique, called ""walling-in"", is a vital part of player's skill set, allowing him to survive early aggression. However, current artificial players (bots) do not possess this skill, due to numerous inconveniences surfacing during its implementation in imperative languages like C++ or Java. In this text, written as a guide for bot programmers, we address the problem of finding an appropriate building placement that would block the entrance to player's base, and present a ready to use declarative solution employing the paradigm of answer set programming (ASP). We also encourage the readers to experiment with different declarative approaches to this problem.",0
"Deliberating on large or continuous state spaces have been long standing challenges in reinforcement learning. Temporal Abstraction have somewhat made this possible, but efficiently planing using temporal abstraction still remains an issue. Moreover using spatial abstractions to learn policies for various situations at once while using temporal abstraction models is an open problem. We propose here an efficient algorithm which is convergent under linear function approximation while planning using temporally abstract actions. We show how this algorithm can be used along with randomly generated option models over multiple time scales to plan agents which need to act real time. Using these randomly generated option models over multiple time scales are shown to reduce number of decision epochs required to solve the given task, hence effectively reducing the time needed for deliberation.",0
"Verification of multi-agents systems (MAS) has been recently studied taking into account the need of expressing resource bounds. Several logics for specifying properties of MAS have been presented in quite a variety of scenarios with bounded resources. In this paper, we study a different formalism, called Priced Resource-Bounded Alternating-time Temporal Logic (PRBATL), whose main novelty consists in moving the notion of resources from a syntactic level (part of the formula) to a semantic one (part of the model). This allows us to track the evolution of the resource availability along the computations and provides us with a formalisms capable to model a number of real-world scenarios. Two relevant aspects are the notion of global availability of the resources on the market, that are shared by the agents, and the notion of price of resources, depending on their availability. In a previous work of ours, an initial step towards this new formalism was introduced, along with an EXPTIME algorithm for the model checking problem. In this paper we better analyze the features of the proposed formalism, also in comparison with previous approaches. The main technical contribution is the proof of the EXPTIME-hardness of the the model checking problem for PRBATL, based on a reduction from the acceptance problem for Linearly-Bounded Alternating Turing Machines. In particular, since the problem has multiple parameters, we show two fixed-parameter reductions.",0
"Survey of several forms of updating, with a practical illustrative example. We study several updating (conditioning) schemes that emerge naturally from a common scenarion to provide some insights into their meaning. Updating is a subtle operation and there is no single method, no single 'good' rule. The choice of the appropriate rule must always be given due consideration. Planchet (1989) presents a mathematical survey of many rules. We focus on the practical meaning of these rules. After summarizing the several rules for conditioning, we present an illustrative example in which the various forms of conditioning can be explained.",0
"In Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA) users pose SPARQL queries over an ontology that lies on top of relational datasources. These queries are translated on-the-fly into SQL queries by OBDA systems. Standard SPARQL-to-SQL translation techniques in OBDA often produce SQL queries containing redundant joins and unions, even after a number of semantic and structural optimizations. These redundancies are detrimental to the performance of query answering, especially in complex industrial OBDA scenarios with large enterprise databases. To address this issue, we introduce two novel notions of OBDA constraints and show how to exploit them for efficient query answering. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on large datasets using real world data and queries, showing that these techniques strongly improve the performance of query answering up to orders of magnitude.",0
"In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel representations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not require `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory power.",0

"In this paper we propose a special type of aggregation function which generalizes the notion of Ordered Weighted Averaging Function - OWA. The resulting functions are called Dynamic Ordered Weighted Averaging Functions --- DYOWAs. This generalization will be developed in such way that the weight vectors are variables depending on the input vector. Particularly, this operators generalize the aggregation functions: Minimum, Maximum, Arithmetic Mean, Median, etc, which are extensively used in image processing. In this field of research two problems are considered: The determination of methods to reduce images and the construction of techniques which provide noise reduction. The operators described here are able to be used in both cases. In terms of image reduction we apply the methodology provided by Patermain et al. We use the noise reduction operators obtained here to treat the images obtained in the first part of the paper, thus obtaining images with better quality.",0
"This paper addresses a question about music cognition: how do we derive polymetric structures. A preference rule system is presented which is implemented into a drum computer. The preference rule system allows inferring local polymetric structures, like two-over-three and three-over-two. By analyzing the micro-timing of West African percussion music a timing pattern consisting of six pulses was discovered. It integrates binary and ternary rhythmic feels. The presented drum computer integrates the discovered superimposed polymetric swing (timing and velocity) appropriate to the rhythmic sequence the user inputs. For binary sequences, the amount of binary swing is increased and for ternary sequences, the ternary swing is increased.",0
"A long-standing dream of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has pursued to encode commonsense knowledge into computer programs enabling machines to reason about our world and problems. This work offers a new practical insight towards the automatic testing of first-order logic (FOL) ontologies. We introduce a novel fully automatic white-box testing framework for first-order logic (FOL) ontologies. The application of the proposed testing method is fully automatic since a) the automated generation of tests is only guided by the syntax of axioms and b) the evaluation of tests is performed by automated theorem provers. Our proposal enables the detection of defective axioms and, additionally, it also serves to demonstrate the suitability for reasoning purposes of those formulas included into FOL ontologies. We validate our proposal by its practical application to different FOL ontologies. In particular, DOLCE ---consisting of around 200 axioms---, FPK (formal proof of the Kepler conjecture) ---which has been derived from the Flyspeck project for its use in the CADE ATP System Competition CASC-J8---, and Adimen-SUMO ---which is an ontology with more than 7,000 axioms derived from SUMO---. As result, we have detected several non-trivial defects that were hidden in those ontologies. Further, we have obtained an improved version of Adimen-SUMO (v2.6) by correcting all the defects detected during the practical application of our white-box testing method.",0
"The choice of architecture of artificial neuron network (ANN) is still a challenging task that users face every time. It greatly affects the accuracy of the built network.

Our method can be applied to regression problems. Experimental results obtained with different datasets, reveals the efficiency of our method.",0
"Current domain-independent, classical planners require symbolic models of the problem domain and instance as input, resulting in a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Meanwhile, although recent work in deep learning has achieved impressive results in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which cannot be directly used by symbolic systems such as planners. We propose LatPlan, an integrated architecture combining deep learning and a classical planner. Given a set of unlabeled training image pairs showing allowed actions in the problem domain, and a pair of images representing the start and goal states, LatPlan uses a Variational Autoencoder to generate a discrete latent vector from the images, based on which a PDDL model can be constructed and then solved by an off-the-shelf planner. We evaluate LatPlan using image-based versions of 3 planning domains: 8-puzzle, LightsOut, and Towers of Hanoi.",0
"The satisfiability problem for SPARQL patterns is undecidable in general, since the expressive power of SPARQL 1.0 is comparable with that of the relational algebra. The goal of this paper is to delineate the boundary of decidability of satisfiability in terms of the constraints allowed in filter conditions. The classes of constraints considered are bound-constraints, negated bound-constraints, equalities, nonequalities, constant-equalities, and constant-nonequalities. The main result of the paper can be summarized by saying that, as soon as inconsistent filter conditions can be formed, satisfiability is undecidable. The key insight in each case is to find a way to emulate the set difference operation. Undecidability can then be obtained from a known undecidability result for the algebra of binary relations with union, composition, and set difference. When no inconsistent filter conditions can be formed, satisfiability is efficiently decidable by simple checks on bound variables and on the use of literals. The paper also points out that satisfiability for the so-called `well-designed' patterns can be decided by a check on bound variables and a check for inconsistent filter conditions.",0
"This work demonstrates how to accelerate dense linear algebra computations using CLBlast, an open-source OpenCL BLAS library providing optimized routines for a wide variety of devices. It is targeted at machine learning and HPC applications and thus provides a fast matrix-multiplication routine (GEMM) to accelerate the core of many applications (e.g. deep learning, iterative solvers, astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry). CLBlast has four main advantages over other BLAS libraries: 1) it is optimized for and tested on a large variety of OpenCL devices including less commonly used devices such as embedded and low-power GPUs, 2) it can be explicitly tuned for specific problem-sizes on specific hardware platforms, 3) it can perform operations in half-precision floating-point FP16 saving precious bandwidth, time and energy, 4) and it can combine multiple operations in a single batched routine, accelerating smaller problems significantly. This paper describes the library and demonstrates the advantages of CLBlast experimentally for different use-cases on a wide variety of OpenCL hardware.",0
"Wooden blocks are a common toy for infants, allowing them to develop motor skills and gain intuition about the physical behavior of the world. In this paper, we explore the ability of deep feed-forward models to learn such intuitive physics. Using a 3D game engine, we create small towers of wooden blocks whose stability is randomized and render them collapsing (or remaining upright). This data allows us to train large convolutional network models which can accurately predict the outcome, as well as estimating the block trajectories. The models are also able to generalize in two important ways: (i) to new physical scenarios, e.g. towers with an additional block and (ii) to images of real wooden blocks, where it obtains a performance comparable to human subjects.",1
"This paper investigates the role of factorial speech processing models in noise-robust automatic speech recognition tasks. Factorial models can embed non-stationary noise models using Markov chains as one of its source chain. The paper proposes a modeling scheme for modeling state-conditional observation distribution of factorial models based on weighted stereo samples. This scheme is an extension to previous single pass retraining for ideal model compensation and here we used it to construct ideal state-conditional observation distributions. Experiments of this paper over the set A of the Aurora 2 dataset shows that by considering noise models with multiple states, system performance can be improved especially in low SNR conditions up to 4% absolute word recognition performance. In addition to its power in accurate representation of state-conditional observation distribution, it has an important advantage over previous methods by providing the opportunity to independently select feature spaces for both source and corrupted features. This opens a new window for seeking better feature spaces appropriate for noise-robust tasks independent from clean speech feature space.",0
"We express Brewka's prioritised default logic (PDL) as argumentation using ASPIC+. By representing PDL as argumentation and designing an argument preference relation that takes the argument structure into account, we prove that the conclusions of the justified arguments correspond to the PDL extensions. We will first assume that the default priority is total, and then generalise to the case where it is a partial order. This provides a characterisation of non-monotonic inference in PDL as an exchange of argument and counter-argument, providing a basis for distributed non-monotonic reasoning in the form of dialogue.",0
"Recognizing implicit discourse relations is a challenging but important task in the field of Natural Language Processing. For such a complex text processing task, different from previous studies, we argue that it is necessary to repeatedly read the arguments and dynamically exploit the efficient features useful for recognizing discourse relations. To mimic the repeated reading strategy, we propose the neural networks with multi-level attention (NNMA), combining the attention mechanism and external memories to gradually fix the attention on some specific words helpful to judging the discourse relations. Experiments on the PDTB dataset show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-art results. The visualization of the attention weights also illustrates the progress that our model observes the arguments on each level and progressively locates the important words.",1
"Intelligent tutoring systems can support students in solving multi-step tasks by providing a hint regarding what to do next. However, engineering such next-step hints manually or using an expert model becomes infeasible if the space of possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to infer next-step hints automatically, relying on past student's data. Such hints typically have the form of an edit which could have been performed by capable students in the given situation, based on what past capable students have done. In this contribution we provide a mathematical framework to analyze edit-based hint policies and, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints for learning tasks with a vast state space and sparse student data. We call this technique the continuous hint factory because it embeds student data in a continuous space, in which the most likely edit can be inferred in a probabilistic sense, similar to the hint factory.",0
"Accurate software development effort estimation is critical to the success of software projects. Although many techniques and algorithmic models have been developed and implemented by practitioners, accurate software development effort prediction is still a challenging endeavor in the field of software engineering, especially in handling uncertain and imprecise inputs and collinear characteristics. In this paper, a hybrid in-telligent model combining a neural network model integrated with fuzzy model (neuro-fuzzy model) has been used to improve the accuracy of estimating software cost. The performance of the proposed model is assessed by designing and conducting evaluation with published project and industrial data. Results have shown that the proposed model demonstrates the ability of improving the estimation accuracy by 18% based on the Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE) criterion.",0
"This paper investigates the mining of class association rules with rough set approach. In data mining, an association occurs between two set of elements when one element set happen together with another. A class association rule set (CARs) is a subset of association rules with classes specified as their consequences. We present an efficient algorithm for mining the finest class rule set inspired form Apriori algorithm, where the support and confidence are computed based on the elementary set of lower approximation included in the property of rough set theory. Our proposed approach has been shown very effective, where the rough set approach for class association discovery is much simpler than the classic association method.",0
"Developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in real world is an expensive and time consuming process. Also, in order to utilize recent advances in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.",0
"Performing sensitivity analysis for influence diagrams using the decision circuit framework is particularly convenient, since the partial derivatives with respect to every parameter are readily available [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007; 2008]. In this paper we present three non-linear sensitivity analysis methods that utilize this partial derivative information and therefore do not require re-evaluating the decision situation multiple times. Specifically, we show how to efficiently compare strategies in decision situations, perform sensitivity to risk aversion and compute the value of perfect hedging [Seyller, 2008].",0
"The notions of disintegration and Bayesian inversion are fundamental in conditional probability theory. They produce channels, as conditional probabilities, from a joint state, or from an already given channel (in opposite direction). These notions exist in the literature, in concrete situations, but are presented here in abstract graphical formulations. The resulting abstract descriptions are used for proving basic results in conditional probability theory. The existence of disintegration and Bayesian inversion is discussed for discrete probability, and also for measure-theoretic probability --- via standard Borel spaces and via likelihoods. Finally, the usefulness of disintegration and Bayesian inversion is illustrated in several non-trivial examples.",0
"Risk aggregation is a popular method used to estimate the sum of a collection of financial assets or events, where each asset or event is modelled as a random variable. Applications, in the financial services industry, include insurance, operational risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis, but the problem is widely encountered in many other application domains. This thesis has contributed two algorithms to perform Bayesian risk aggregation when model exhibit hybrid dependency and high dimensional inter-dependency. The first algorithm operates on a subset of the general problem, with an emphasis on convolution problems, in the presence of continuous and discrete variables (so called hybrid models) and the second algorithm offer a universal method for general purpose inference over much wider classes of Bayesian Network models.",0
"We examine a new approach to modeling uncertainty based on plausibility measures, where a plausibility measure just associates with an event its plausibility, an element is some partially ordered set. This approach is easily seen to generalize other approaches to modeling uncertainty, such as probability measures, belief functions, and possibility measures. The lack of structure in a plausibility measure makes it easy for us to add structure on an ""as needed"" basis, letting us examine what is required to ensure that a plausibility measure has certain properties of interest. This gives us insight into the essential features of the properties in question, while allowing us to prove general results that apply to many approaches to reasoning about uncertainty. Plausibility measures have already proved useful in analyzing default reasoning. In this paper, we examine their ""algebraic properties,"" analogues to the use of + and * in probability theory. An understanding of such properties will be essential if plausibility measures are to be used in practice as a representation tool.",0
"Rough set theory, a mathematical tool to deal with vague concepts, has originally described the indiscernibility of elements by equivalence relations. Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to covers. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the covers themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on covers. A notion of homomorphism is provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.",0
"This paper deals with the problem of estimating the probability that one event was a cause of another in a given scenario. Using structural-semantical definitions of the probabilities of necessary or sufficient causation (or both), we show how to optimally bound these quantities from data obtained in experimental and observational studies, making minimal assumptions concerning the data-generating process. In particular, we strengthen the results of Pearl (1999) by weakening the data-generation assumptions and deriving theoretically sharp bounds on the probabilities of causation. These results delineate precisely how empirical data can be used both in settling questions of attribution and in solving attribution-related problems of decision making.",0
"The AgreementMaker system was the leading system in the anatomy task of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) competition in 2011. While AgreementMaker did not compete in OAEI 2012, here we report on its performance in the 2012 anatomy task, using the same configurations of AgreementMaker submitted to OAEI 2011. Additionally, we also test AgreementMaker using an updated version of the UBERON ontology as a mediating ontology, and otherwise identical configurations. AgreementMaker achieved an F-measure of 91.8% with the 2011 configurations, and an F-measure of 92.2% with the updated UBERON ontology. Thus, AgreementMaker would have been the second best system had it competed in the anatomy task of OAEI 2012, and only 0.1% below the F-measure of the best system.",0
"Recent research in multi-robot exploration and mapping has focused on sampling environmental fields, which are typically modeled using the Gaussian process (GP). Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for learning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem structure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of observations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these strategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational burden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient information-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We analyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem, and demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the non-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide theoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based policy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task settings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to violation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world temperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy can generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the widely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field conditions and task settings while enjoying significant computational gain over them.",0
"With the range and sensitivity of algorithmic decisions expanding at a break-neck speed, it is imperative that we aggressively investigate whether programs are biased. We propose a novel probabilistic program analysis technique and apply it to quantifying bias in decision-making programs. Specifically, we (i) present a sound and complete automated verification technique for proving quantitative properties of probabilistic programs; (ii) show that certain notions of bias, recently proposed in the fairness literature, can be phrased as quantitative correctness properties; and (iii) present FairSquare, the first verification tool for quantifying program bias, and evaluate it on a range of decision-making programs.",0
"The orbital debris problem presents an opportunity for inter-agency and international cooperation toward the mutually beneficial goals of debris prevention, mitigation, remediation, and improved space situational awareness (SSA). Achieving these goals requires sharing orbital debris and other SSA data. Toward this, I present an ontological architecture for the orbital debris domain, taking steps in the creation of an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The purpose of this ontological system is to (I) represent general orbital debris and SSA domain knowledge, (II) structure, and standardize where needed, orbital data and terminology, and (III) foster semantic interoperability and data-sharing. In doing so I hope to (IV) contribute to solving the orbital debris problem, improving peaceful global SSA, and ensuring safe space travel for future generations.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of detecting coherent motions in crowd scenes and presents its two applications in crowd scene understanding: semantic region detection and recurrent activity mining. It processes input motion fields (e.g., optical flow fields) and produces a coherent motion filed, named as thermal energy field. The thermal energy field is able to capture both motion correlation among particles and the motion trends of individual particles which are helpful to discover coherency among them. We further introduce a two-step clustering process to construct stable semantic regions from the extracted time-varying coherent motions. These semantic regions can be used to recognize pre-defined activities in crowd scenes. Finally, we introduce a cluster-and-merge process which automatically discovers recurrent activities in crowd scenes by clustering and merging the extracted coherent motions. Experiments on various videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"Markov control algorithms that perform smooth, non-greedy updates of the policy have been shown to be very general and versatile, with policy gradient and Expectation Maximisation algorithms being particularly popular. For these algorithms, marginal inference of the reward weighted trajectory distribution is required to perform policy updates. We discuss a new exact inference algorithm for these marginals in the finite horizon case that is more efficient than the standard approach based on classical forward-backward recursions. We also provide a principled extension to infinite horizon Markov Decision Problems that explicitly accounts for an infinite horizon. This extension provides a novel algorithm for both policy gradients and Expectation Maximisation in infinite horizon problems.",0
"Observable operator models (OOMs) and related models are one of the most important and powerful tools for modeling and analyzing stochastic systems. They can exactly describe dynamics of finite-rank systems, and be efficiently learned from data by moment based algorithms. Almost all OOM learning algorithms are developed based on the assumption of equilibrium data which is very difficult to guarantee in real life, especially for complex processes with large time scales. In this paper, we derive a nonequilibrium learning algorithm for OOMs, which dismisses this assumption and can effectively extract the equilibrium dynamics of a system from nonequilibrium observation data. In addition, we propose binless OOMs for the application of nonequilibrium learning to continuous-valued systems. In comparison with the other OOMs with continuous observations, binless OOMs can achieve consistent estimation from nonequilibrium data with only linear computational complexity.",1
"With the large volume of new information created every day, determining the validity of information in a knowledge graph and filling in its missing parts are crucial tasks for many researchers and practitioners. To address this challenge, a number of knowledge graph completion methods have been developed using low-dimensional graph embeddings. Although researchers continue to improve these models using an increasingly complex feature space, we show that simple changes in the architecture of the underlying model can outperform state-of-the-art models without the need for complex feature engineering. In this work, we present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE that fills-in missing information in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings of the knowledge graph's entities and edges, and through subtle, but important, changes to the standard loss function. In doing so, ProjE has a parameter size that is smaller than 11 out of 15 existing methods while performing $37\%$ better than the current-best method on standard datasets. We also show, via a new fact checking task, that ProjE is capable of accurately determining the veracity of many declarative statements.",1
"Deep compositional models of meaning acting on distributional representations of words in order to produce vectors of larger text constituents are evolving to a popular area of NLP research. We detail a compositional distributional framework based on a rich form of word embeddings that aims at facilitating the interactions between words in the context of a sentence. Embeddings and composition layers are jointly learned against a generic objective that enhances the vectors with syntactic information from the surrounding context. Furthermore, each word is associated with a number of senses, the most plausible of which is selected dynamically during the composition process. We evaluate the produced vectors qualitatively and quantitatively with positive results. At the sentence level, the effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on the MSRPar task, for which we report results within the state-of-the-art range.",1
"Situation calculus has been applied widely in artificial intelligence to model and reason about actions and changes in dynamic systems. Since actions carried out by agents will cause constant changes of the agents' beliefs, how to manage these changes is a very important issue. Shapiro et al. [22] is one of the studies that considered this issue. However, in this framework, the problem of noisy sensing, which often presents in real-world applications, is not considered. As a consequence, noisy sensing actions in this framework will lead to an agent facing inconsistent situation and subsequently the agent cannot proceed further. In this paper, we investigate how noisy sensing actions can be handled in iterated belief change within the situation calculus formalism. We extend the framework proposed in [22] with the capability of managing noisy sensings. We demonstrate that an agent can still detect the actual situation when the ratio of noisy sensing actions vs. accurate sensing actions is limited. We prove that our framework subsumes the iterated belief change strategy in [22] when all sensing actions are accurate. Furthermore, we prove that our framework can adequately handle belief introspection, mistaken beliefs, belief revision and belief update even with noisy sensing, as done in [22] with accurate sensing actions only.",0
A new agent architecture called Limited Instruction Set Agent (LISA) is introduced for autonomous control. The new architecture is based on previous implementations of AgentSpeak and it is structurally simpler than its predecessors with the aim of facilitating design-time and run-time verification methods. The process of abstracting the LISA system to two different types of discrete probabilistic models (DTMC and MDP) is investigated and illustrated. The LISA system provides a tool for complete modelling of the agent and the environment for probabilistic verification. The agent program can be automatically compiled into a DTMC or a MDP model for verification with Prism. The automatically generated Prism model can be used for both design-time and run-time verification. The run-time verification is investigated and illustrated in the LISA system as an internal modelling mechanism for prediction of future outcomes.,0
"We present a novel algorithm that synthesizes imperative programs for introductory programming courses. Given a set of input-output examples and a partial program, our algorithm generates a complete program that is consistent with every example. Our key idea is to combine enumerative program synthesis and static analysis, which aggressively prunes out a large search space while guaranteeing to find, if any, a correct solution. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool, called SIMPL, and evaluated it on 30 problems used in introductory programming courses. The results show that SIMPL is able to solve the benchmark problems in 6.6 seconds on average.",0
"LTL synthesis -- the construction of a function to satisfy a logical specification formulated in Linear Temporal Logic -- is a 2EXPTIME-complete problem with relevant applications in controller synthesis and a myriad of artificial intelligence applications. In this research note we consider De Giacomo and Vardi's variant of the synthesis problem for LTL formulas interpreted over finite rather than infinite traces. Rather surprisingly, given the existing claims on complexity, we establish that LTL synthesis is EXPTIME-complete for the finite interpretation, and not 2EXPTIME-complete as previously reported. Our result coincides nicely with the planning perspective where non-deterministic planning with full observability is EXPTIME-complete and partial observability increases the complexity to 2EXPTIME-complete; a recent related result for LTL synthesis shows that in the finite case with partial observability, the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete.",0
"The semigraphoid closure of every couple of CI-statements (GI=conditional independence) is a stochastic CI-model. As a consequence of this result it is shown that every probabilistically sound inference rule for CI-model, having at most two antecedents, is derivable from the semigraphoid inference rules. This justifies the use of semigraphoids as approximations of stochastic CI-models in probabilistic reasoning. The list of all 19 potential dominant elements of the mentioned semigraphoid closure is given as a byproduct.",0
"This paper contains the consideration of knowledge extraction mechanisms of such object-oriented knowledge representation models as frames, object-oriented programming and object-oriented dynamic networks. In addition, conception of universal exploiters within object-oriented dynamic networks is also discussed. The main result of the paper is introduction of new exploiters-based knowledge extraction approach, which provides generation of a finite set of new classes of objects, based on the basic set of classes. The methods for calculation of quantity of new classes, which can be obtained using proposed approach, and of quantity of types, which each of them describes, are proposed. Proof that basic set of classes, extended according to proposed approach, together with union exploiter create upper semilattice is given. The approach always allows generating of finitely defined set of new classes of objects for any object-oriented dynamic network. A quantity of these classes can be precisely calculated before the generation. It allows saving of only basic set of classes in the knowledge base.",0
"Planning for ad hoc teamwork is challenging because it involves agents collaborating without any prior coordination or communication. The focus is on principled methods for a single agent to cooperate with others. This motivates investigating the ad hoc teamwork problem in the context of individual decision making frameworks. However, individual decision making in multiagent settings faces the task of having to reason about other agents' actions, which in turn involves reasoning about others. An established approximation that operationalizes this approach is to bound the infinite nesting from below by introducing level 0 models. We show that a consequence of the finitely-nested modeling is that we may not obtain optimal team solutions in cooperative settings. We address this limitation by including models at level 0 whose solutions involve learning. We demonstrate that the learning integrated into planning in the context of interactive dynamic influence diagrams facilitates optimal team behavior, and is applicable to ad hoc teamwork.",0
"This paper argues that a combined treatment of probabilities, time and actions is essential for an appropriate logical account of the notion of probability; and, based on this intuition, describes an expressive probabilistic temporal logic for reasoning about actions with uncertain outcomes. The logic is modal and higher-order: modalities annotated by actions are used to express possibility and necessity of propositions in the next states resulting from the actions, and a higher-order function is needed to express the probability operator. The proposed logic is shown to be an adequate extension of classical mathematical probability theory, and its expressiveness is illustrated through the formalization of the Monty Hall problem.",0
"Coalition formation is a key topic in multi-agent systems. Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their own. Previous work has shown problems in coalitional games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and Kraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable.",1
"The Human visual perception of the world is of a large fixed image that is highly detailed and sharp. However, receptor density in the retina is not uniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits high resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial resolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a very small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception of a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs the eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move between these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as ""saccades"". Once a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a second while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An artificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network set within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions of interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with several experimentally observed phenomena, and suggests novel predictions.",0
"Planning plays an important role in the broad class of decision theory. Planning has drawn much attention in recent work in the robotics and sequential decision making areas. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g. graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these popular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of learning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these models is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and underestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the agent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is not a suitable model.",0
"We investigate the problem of inconsistency measurement on large knowledge bases by considering stream-based inconsistency measurement, i.e., we investigate inconsistency measures that cannot consider a knowledge base as a whole but process it within a stream. For that, we present, first, a novel inconsistency measure that is apt to be applied to the streaming case and, second, stream-based approximations for the new and some existing inconsistency measures. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis on the behavior of these inconsistency measures on large knowledge bases, in terms of runtime, accuracy, and scalability. We conclude that for two of these measures, the approximation of the new inconsistency measure and an approximation of the contension inconsistency measure, large-scale inconsistency measurement is feasible.",0
"We propose a logical analysis of the concept of typicality, central in human cognition (Rosch,1978). We start from a previously proposed extension of the basic Description Logic ALC (a computationally tractable fragment of First Order Logic, used to represent concept inclusions and ontologies) with a typicality operator T that allows to consistently represent the attribution to classes of individuals of properties with exceptions (as in the classic example (i) typical birds fly, (ii) penguins are birds but (iii) typical penguins don't fly). We then strengthen this extension in order to separately reason about the typicality with respect to different aspects (e.g., flying, having nice feather: in the previous example, penguins may not inherit the property of flying, for which they are exceptional, but can nonetheless inherit other properties, such as having nice feather).",0
"A graphical multiagent model (GMM) represents a joint distribution over the behavior of a set of agents. One source of knowledge about agents' behavior may come from gametheoretic analysis, as captured by several graphical game representations developed in recent years. GMMs generalize this approach to express arbitrary distributions, based on game descriptions or other sources of knowledge bearing on beliefs about agent behavior. To illustrate the flexibility of GMMs, we exhibit game-derived models that allow probabilistic deviation from equilibrium, as well as models based on heuristic action choice. We investigate three different methods of integrating these models into a single model representing the combined knowledge sources. To evaluate the predictive performance of the combined model, we treat as actual outcome the behavior produced by a reinforcement learning process. We find that combining the two knowledge sources, using any of the methods, provides better predictions than either source alone. Among the combination methods, mixing data outperforms the opinion pool and direct update methods investigated in this empirical trial.",0
"The goal of imitation learning is to match example expert behavior, without access to a reinforcement signal. Expert demonstrations provided by humans, however, often show significant variability due to latent factors that are not explicitly modeled. We introduce an extension to the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning method that can infer the latent structure of human decision-making in an unsupervised way. Our method can not only imitate complex behaviors, but also learn interpretable and meaningful representations. We demonstrate that the approach is applicable to high-dimensional environments including raw visual inputs. In the highway driving domain, we show that a model learned from demonstrations is able to both produce different styles of human-like driving behaviors and accurately anticipate human actions. Our method surpasses various baselines in terms of performance and functionality.",1
"Characterizing relationships between people is fundamental for the understanding of narratives. In this work, we address the problem of inferring the polarity of relationships between people in narrative summaries. We formulate the problem as a joint structured prediction for each narrative, and present a model that combines evidence from linguistic and semantic features, as well as features based on the structure of the social community in the text. We also provide a clustering-based approach that can exploit regularities in narrative types. e.g., learn an affinity for love-triangles in romantic stories. On a dataset of movie summaries from Wikipedia, our structured models provide more than a 30% error-reduction over a competitive baseline that considers pairs of characters in isolation.",1
The paper discusses scientific and technological problems of dynamic integrated expert systems development. Extensions of problem-oriented methodology for dynamic integrated expert systems development are considered. Attention is paid to the temporal knowledge representation and processing.,0
"Process mining techniques focus on extracting insight in processes from event logs. Process mining has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions when applied on data from smart home environments. However, events recorded in smart home environments are on the level of sensor triggers, at which process discovery algorithms produce overgeneralizing process models that allow for too much behavior and that are difficult to interpret for human experts. We show that abstracting the events to a higher-level interpretation can enable discovery of more precise and more comprehensible models. We present a framework for the extraction of features that can be used for abstraction with supervised learning methods that is based on the XES IEEE standard for event logs. This framework can automatically abstract sensor-level events to their interpretation at the human activity level, after training it on training data for which both the sensor and human activity events are known. We demonstrate our abstraction framework on three real-life smart home event logs and show that the process models that can be discovered after abstraction are more precise indeed.",0
"Causal models defined in terms of structural equations have proved to be quite a powerful way of representing knowledge regarding causality. However, a number of authors have given examples that seem to show that the Halpern-Pearl (HP) definition of causality gives intuitively unreasonable answers. Here it is shown that, for each of these examples, we can give two stories consistent with the description in the example, such that intuitions regarding causality are quite different for each story. By adding additional variables, we can disambiguate the stories. Moreover, in the resulting causal models, the HP definition of causality gives the intuitively correct answer. It is also shown that, by adding extra variables, a modification to the original HP definition made to deal with an example of Hopkins and Pearl may not be necessary. Given how much can be done by adding extra variables, there might be a concern that the notion of causality is somewhat unstable. Can adding extra variables in a ""conservative"" way (i.e., maintaining all the relations between the variables in the original model) cause the answer to the question ""Is X=x a cause of Y=y"" to alternate between ""yes"" and ""no""? It is shown that we can have such alternation infinitely often, but if we take normality into consideration, we cannot. Indeed, under appropriate normality assumptions. adding an extra variable can change the answer from ""yes"" to ""no"", but after that, it cannot cannot change back to ""yes"".",0
"Learning from synthetic data has many important and practical applications. An example of application is photo-sketch recognition. Using synthetic data is challenging due to the differences in feature distributions between synthetic and real data, a phenomenon we term synthetic gap. In this paper, we investigate and formalize a general framework-Stacked Multichannel Autoencoder (SMCAE) that enables bridging the synthetic gap and learning from synthetic data more efficiently. In particular, we show that our SMCAE can not only transform and use synthetic data on the challenging face-sketch recognition task, but that it can also help simulate real images, which can be used for training classifiers for recognition. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of the framework.",0
"Understanding infant development is one of the greatest scientific challenges of contemporary science. A large source of difficulty comes from the fact that the development of skills in infants results from the interactions of multiple mechanisms at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The concepts of ""innate"" or ""acquired"" are not any more adequate tools for explanations, which call for a shift from reductionist to systemic accounts. To address this challenge, building and experimenting with robots modeling the growing infant brain and body is crucial. Systemic explanations of pattern formation in sensorimotor, cognitive and social development, viewed as a complex dynamical system, require the use of formal models based on mathematics, algorithms and robots. Formulating hypothesis about development using such models, and exploring them through experiments, allows us to consider in detail the interaction between many mechanisms and parameters. This complements traditional experimental methods in psychology and neuroscience where only a few variables can be studied at the same time. Furthermore, the use of robots is of particular importance. The laws of physics generate everywhere around us spontaneous patterns in the inorganic world. They also strongly impact the living, and in particular constrain and guide infant development through the properties of its (changing) body in interaction with the physical environment. Being able to consider the body as an experimental variable, something that can be systematically changed in order to study the impact on skill formation, has been a dream to many developmental scientists. This is today becoming possible with developmental robotics.",0
"Bio-inspired optimization algorithms have been gaining more popularity recently. One of the most important of these algorithms is particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO is based on the collective intelligence of a swam of particles. Each particle explores a part of the search space looking for the optimal position and adjusts its position according to two factors; the first is its own experience and the second is the collective experience of the whole swarm. PSO has been successfully used to solve many optimization problems. In this work we use PSO to improve the performance of a well-known representation method of time series data which is the symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). As with other time series representation methods, SAX results in loss of information when applied to represent time series. In this paper we use PSO to propose a new minimum distance WMD for SAX to remedy this problem. Unlike the original minimum distance, the new distance sets different weights to different segments of the time series according to their information content. This weighted minimum distance enhances the performance of SAX as we show through experiments using different time series datasets.",0
This paper studies a new and more general axiomatization than one presented previously for preference on likelihood gambles. Likelihood gambles describe actions in a situation where a decision maker knows multiple probabilistic models and a random sample generated from one of those models but does not know prior probability of models. This new axiom system is inspired by Jensen's axiomatization of probabilistic gambles. Our approach provides a new perspective to the role of data in decision making under ambiguity. It avoids one of the most controversial issue of Bayesian methodology namely the assumption of prior probability.,0
"This paper has three main contributions to our understanding of fixed-depth minimax search: (A) A new formulation for Stockman's SSS* algorithm, based on Alpha-Beta, is presented. It solves all the perceived drawbacks of SSS*, finally transforming it into a practical algorithm. In effect, we show that SSS* = alpha-beta + ransposition tables. The crucial step is the realization that transposition tables contain so-called solution trees, structures that are used in best-first search algorithms like SSS*. Having created a practical version, we present performance measurements with tournament game-playing programs for three different minimax games, yielding results that contradict a number of publications. (B) Based on the insights gained in our attempts at understanding SSS*, we present a framework that facilitates the construction of several best-first fixed- depth game-tree search algorithms, known and new. The framework is based on depth-first null-window Alpha-Beta search, enhanced with storage to allow for the refining of previous search results. It focuses attention on the essential differences between algorithms. (C) We present a new instance of the framework, MTD(f). It is well-suited for use with iterative deepening, and performs better than algorithms that are currently used in most state-of-the-art game-playing programs. We provide experimental evidence to explain why MTD(f) performs better than the other fixed-depth minimax algorithms.",0
"Set and multiset variables in constraint programming have typically been represented using subset bounds. However, this is a weak representation that neglects potentially useful information about a set such as its cardinality. For set variables, the length-lex (LL) representation successfully provides information about the length (cardinality) and position in the lexicographic ordering. For multiset variables, where elements can be repeated, we consider richer representations that take into account additional information. We study eight different representations in which we maintain bounds according to one of the eight different orderings: length-(co)lex (LL/LC), variety-(co)lex (VL/VC), length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC), and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) orderings. These representations integrate together information about the cardinality, variety (number of distinct elements in the multiset), and position in some total ordering. Theoretical and empirical comparisons of expressiveness and compactness of the eight representations suggest that length-variety-(co)lex (LVL/LVC) and variety-length-(co)lex (VLL/VLC) usually give tighter bounds after constraint propagation. We implement the eight representations and evaluate them against the subset bounds representation with cardinality and variety reasoning. Results demonstrate that they offer significantly better pruning and runtime.",1
"Transforming constraint models is an important task in re- cent constraint programming systems. User-understandable models are defined during the modeling phase but rewriting or tuning them is manda- tory to get solving-efficient models. We propose a new architecture al- lowing to define bridges between any (modeling or solver) languages and to implement model optimizations. This architecture follows a model- driven approach where the constraint modeling process is seen as a set of model transformations. Among others, an interesting feature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e. based on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy called a metamodel.",0
"We explore the idea of using a ""possibilistic graphical model"" as the basis for a world model that drives a dialog system. As a first step we have developed a system that uses text-based dialog to derive a model of the user's family relations. The system leverages its world model to infer relational triples, to learn to recover from upstream coreference resolution errors and ambiguities, and to learn context-dependent paraphrase models. We also explore some theoretical aspects of the underlying graphical model.",0
"In many AI domains such as product configuration, a user should interactively specify a solution that must satisfy a set of constraints. In such scenarios, offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrack-free user interaction online. In particular,binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration. In this paper we discuss how to extend BDD-based configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences.",0
"In this work we are interested in the problem of energy management in Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET). The solving and optimization of MANET allow assisting the users to efficiently use their devices in order to minimize the batteries power consumption. In this framework, we propose a modelling of the MANET in form of a Constraint Optimization Problem called COMANET. Then, in the objective to minimize the consumption of batteries power, we present an approach based on an adaptation of the A star algorithm to the MANET problem called MANED. Finally, we expose some experimental results showing utility of this approach.",0
"Emotion estimation in music listening is confronting challenges to capture the emotion variation of listeners. Recent years have witnessed attempts to exploit multimodality fusing information from musical contents and physiological signals captured from listeners to improve the performance of emotion recognition. In this paper, we present a study of fusion of signals of electroencephalogram (EEG), a tool to capture brainwaves at a high-temporal resolution, and musical features at decision level in recognizing the time-varying binary classes of arousal and valence. Our empirical results showed that the fusion could outperform the performance of emotion recognition using only EEG modality that was suffered from inter-subject variability, and this suggested the promise of multimodal fusion in improving the accuracy of music-emotion recognition.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established paradigm of declarative programming that has been developed in the field of non-monotonic reasoning and logic programming. Advances in ASP solving technology are customarily assessed in competition events, as it happens for other closely-related problemsolving technologies such as SAT/SMT, QBF, Planning and Scheduling etc. ASP Competitions are (usually) biennial events, but the 5th edition departs from this tradition in order to be present in the FLoC Olympic Games of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) 2014, which will be the largest event in the history of logic.",0
"Most traditional models of uncertainty have focused on the associational relationship among variables as captured by conditional dependence. In order to successfully manage intelligent systems for decision making, however, we must be able to predict the effects of actions. In this paper, we attempt to unite two branches of research that address such predictions: causal modeling and decision analysis. First, we provide a definition of causal dependence in decision-analytic terms, which we derive from consequences of causal dependence cited in the literature. Using this definition, we show how causal dependence can be represented within an influence diagram. In particular, we identify two inadequacies of an ordinary influence diagram as a representation for cause. We introduce a special class of influence diagrams, called causal influence diagrams, which corrects one of these problems, and identify situations where the other inadequacy can be eliminated. In addition, we describe the relationships between Howard Canonical Form and existing graphical representations of cause.",0
"The project of the Ontology Web Search Engine is presented in this paper. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a project that can be easily implemented. Ontology Web Search Engine is software to look for and index ontologies in the Web. OWL (Web Ontology Languages) ontologies are meant, and they are necessary for the functioning of the SWES (Semantic Web Expert System). SWES is an expert system that will use found ontologies from the Web, generating rules from them, and will supplement its knowledge base with these generated rules. It is expected that the SWES will serve as a universal expert system for the average user.",0
"Problems such as predicting an optical flow field (Y) for an image (X) are ambiguous: many very distinct solutions are good. Representing this ambiguity requires building a conditional model P(Y|X) of the prediction, conditioned on the image. It is hard because training data usually does not contain many different flow fields for the same image. As a result, we need different images to share data to produce good models. We demonstrate an improved method for building conditional models, the Co-Embedding Deep Variational Auto Encoder. Our CDVAE exploits multiple encoding and decoding layers for both X and Y. These are tied during training to produce a model of the joint distribution P(X, Y), which provides the necessary smoothing. Our tying procedure is designed to yield a conditional model easy at test time. We demonstrate our model on three example tasks using real data: image saturation adjustment, image relighting, and motion prediction. We describe quantitative evaluation metrics to evaluate ambiguous generation results. Our results quantitatively and qualitatively advance the state of the art.",0
"There is a growing trend towards the convergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and social computing, which will lead to the emergence of smart communities composed of various objects (including both human individuals and physical things) that interact and cooperate with each other. These smart communities promise to enable a number of innovative applications and services that will improve the quality of life. This position paper addresses some opportunities and challenges of building smart communities characterized by cyber-physical and social intelligence.",0
"We propose a new approach to the analysis of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) by establishing a formula that connects the Hessian of the Bethe free energy with the edge zeta function. The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP. It is applied to give a sufficient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive definite, which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles. The formula clarifies the relation between the local stability of a fixed point of LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy. We also propose a new approach to the uniqueness of LBP fixed point, and show various conditions of uniqueness.",1
"Strategic Environmental Assessment is a procedure aimed at introducing systematic assessment of the environmental effects of plans and programs. This procedure is based on the so-called coaxial matrices that define dependencies between plan activities (infrastructures, plants, resource extractions, buildings, etc.) and positive and negative environmental impacts, and dependencies between these impacts and environmental receptors. Up to now, this procedure is manually implemented by environmental experts for checking the environmental effects of a given plan or program, but it is never applied during the plan/program construction. A decision support system, based on a clear logic semantics, would be an invaluable tool not only in assessing a single, already defined plan, but also during the planning process in order to produce an optimized, environmentally assessed plan and to study possible alternative scenarios. We propose two logic-based approaches to the problem, one based on Constraint Logic Programming and one on Probabilistic Logic Programming that could be, in the future, conveniently merged to exploit the advantages of both. We test the proposed approaches on a real energy plan and we discuss their limitations and advantages.",0
"We consider a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP) that models a class of sequencing problems. Although POMDPs are typically intractable, our formulation admits tractable solution. Instead of maintaining a value function over a high-dimensional set of belief states, we reduce the state space to one of smaller dimension, in which grid-based dynamic programming techniques are effective. We develop an error bound for the resulting approximation, and discuss an application of the model to a problem in targeted advertising.",0
"This paper describes a relatively simple way of allowing a brain model to self-organise its concept patterns through nested structures. Time is a key element and a simulator would be able to show how patterns may form and then fire in sequence, as part of a search or thought process. It uses a very simple equation to show how the inhibitors in particular, can switch off certain areas, to allow other areas to become the prominent ones and thereby define the current brain state. This allows for a small amount of control over what appears to be a chaotic structure inside of the brain. It is attractive because it is still mostly mechanical and therefore can be added as an automatic process, or the modelling of that. The paper also describes how the nested pattern structure can be used as a basic counting mechanism. This extended version integrates further with the existing cognitive model and provides new conclusions.",0
"When two or more self-interested agents put their plans to execution in the same environment, conflicts may arise as a consequence, for instance, of a common utilization of resources. In this case, an agent can postpone the execution of a particular action, if this punctually solves the conflict, or it can resort to execute a different plan if the agent's payoff significantly diminishes due to the action deferral. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach to non-cooperative planning that helps predict before execution what plan schedules agents will adopt so that the set of strategies of all agents constitute a Nash equilibrium. We perform some experiments and discuss the solutions obtained with our game-theoretical approach, analyzing how the conflicts between the plans determine the strategic behavior of the agents.",1
"In this paper, we propose a novel age estimation method based on GLOH feature descriptor and multi-task learning (MTL). The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.",0
"Although different learning systems are coordinated to afford complex behavior, little is known about how this occurs. This article describes a theoretical framework that specifies how complex behaviors that might be thought to require error-driven learning might instead be acquired through simple reinforcement. This framework includes specific assumptions about the mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of (artificial) neural networks to generate topologies that allow the networks to learn large-scale complex problems using only information about the quality of their performance. The practical and theoretical implications of the framework are discussed, as are possible biological analogs of the approach.",0
"This paper offers an approach to extensible knowledge representation and reasoning for a family of formalisms known as Description Logics. The approach is based on the notion of adding new concept constructors, and includes a heuristic methodology for specifying the desired extensions, as well as a modularized software architecture that supports implementing extensions. The architecture detailed here falls in the normalize-compared paradigm, and supports both intentional reasoning (subsumption) involving concepts, and extensional reasoning involving individuals after incremental updates to the knowledge base. The resulting approach can be used to extend the reasoner with specialized notions that are motivated by specific problems or application areas, such as reasoning about dates, plans, etc. In addition, it provides an opportunity to implement constructors that are not currently yet sufficiently well understood theoretically, but are needed in practice. Also, for constructors that are provably hard to reason with (e.g., ones whose presence would lead to undecidability), it allows the implementation of incomplete reasoners where the incompleteness is tailored to be acceptable for the application at hand.",0
"We describe work to control graphics rendering under limited computational resources by taking a decision-theoretic perspective on perceptual costs and computational savings of approximations. The work extends earlier work on the control of rendering by introducing methods and models for computing the expected cost associated with degradations of scene components. The expected cost is computed by considering the perceptual cost of degradations and a probability distribution over the attentional focus of viewers. We review the critical literature describing findings on visual search and attention, discuss the implications of the findings, and introduce models of expected perceptual cost. Finally, we discuss policies that harness information about the expected cost of scene components.",0
"Clinical decision support systems have been developed to help physicians to take clinical guidelines into account during consultations. The ASTI critiquing module is one such systems; it provides the physician with automatic criticisms when a drug prescription does not follow the guidelines. It was initially developed for hypertension and type 2 diabetes, but is designed to be generic enough for application to all chronic diseases. We present here the results of usability and satisfaction evaluations for the ASTI critiquing module, obtained with GPs for a newly implemented guideline concerning dyslipaemia, and we discuss the lessons learnt and the difficulties encountered when building a generic DSS for critiquing physicians' prescriptions.",0
"The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework offers a simple and sound basis for representing and solving simple decision problems, without uncertainty. This paper is devoted to an extension of the CSP framework enabling us to deal with some decisions problems under uncertainty. This extension relies on a differentiation between the agent-controllable decision variables and the uncontrollable parameters whose values depend on the occurrence of uncertain events. The uncertainty on the values of the parameters is assumed to be given under the form of a probability distribution. Two algorithms are given, for computing respectively decisions solving the problem with a maximal probability, and conditional decisions mapping the largest possible amount of possible cases to actual decisions.",0
"We consider the problem of creating fair course timetables in the setting of a university. Our motivation is to improve the overall satisfaction of individuals concerned (students, teachers, etc.) by providing a fair timetable to them. The central idea is that undesirable arrangements in the course timetable, i.e., violations of soft constraints, should be distributed in a fair way among the individuals. We propose two formulations for the fair course timetabling problem that are based on max-min fairness and Jain's fairness index, respectively. Furthermore, we present and experimentally evaluate an optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing for solving max-min fair course timetabling problems. The new contribution is concerned with measuring the energy difference between two timetables, i.e., how much worse a timetable is compared to another timetable with respect to max-min fairness. We introduce three different energy difference measures and evaluate their impact on the overall algorithm performance. The second proposed problem formulation focuses on the tradeoff between fairness and the total amount of soft constraint violations. Our experimental evaluation shows that the known best solutions to the ITC2007 curriculum-based course timetabling instances are quite fair with respect to Jain's fairness index. However, the experiments also show that the fairness can be improved further for only a rather small increase in the total amount of soft constraint violations.",0
"This paper examines the use of Bayesian Networks to tackle one of the tougher problems in requirements engineering, translating user requirements into system requirements. The approach taken is to model domain knowledge as Bayesian Network fragments that are glued together to form a complete view of the domain specific system requirements. User requirements are introduced as evidence and the propagation of belief is used to determine what are the appropriate system requirements as indicated by user requirements. This concept has been demonstrated in the development of a system specification and the results are presented here.",0
"Machine learning is making substantial progress in diverse applications. The success is mostly due to advances in deep learning. However, deep learning can make mistakes and its generalization abilities to new tasks are questionable. We ask when and how one can combine network outputs, when (i) details of the observations are evaluated by learned deep components and (ii) facts and confirmation rules are available in knowledge based systems. We show that in limited contexts the required number of training samples can be low and self-improvement of pre-trained networks in more general context is possible. We argue that the combination of sparse outlier detection with deep components that can support each other diminish the fragility of deep methods, an important requirement for engineering applications. We argue that supervised learning of labels may be fully eliminated under certain conditions: a component based architecture together with a knowledge based system can train itself and provide high quality answers. We demonstrate these concepts on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection benchmark. We argue that the view of the Study Panel (2016) may overestimate the requirements on `years of focused research' and `careful, unique construction' for `AI systems'.",0
"The design and analysis of communication systems typically rely on the development of mathematical models that describe the underlying communication channel, which dictates the relationship between the transmitted and the received signals. However, in some systems, such as molecular communication systems where chemical signals are used for transfer of information, it is not possible to accurately model this relationship. In these scenarios, because of the lack of mathematical channel models, a completely new approach to design and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by borrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We evaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and difficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform significantly better than a simple detector that was used in previous works, which also did not assume any knowledge of the channel.",0
"In this paper we show that the problem of checking consistency of a knowledge base in the Description Logic ALCM is ExpTime-complete. The M stands for meta-modelling as defined by Motz, Rohrer and Severi. To show our main result, we define an ExpTime Tableau algorithm as an extension of an algorithm for checking consistency of a knowledge base in ALC by Nguyen and Szalas.",0
"In the Markov decision process model, policies are usually evaluated by expected cumulative rewards. As this decision criterion is not always suitable, we propose in this paper an algorithm for computing a policy optimal for the quantile criterion. Both finite and infinite horizons are considered. Finally we experimentally evaluate our approach on random MDPs and on a data center control problem.",1
"In this paper, we propose to learn sources independence in order to choose the appropriate type of combination rules when aggregating their beliefs. Some combination rules are used with the assumption of their sources independence whereas others combine beliefs of dependent sources. Therefore, the choice of the combination rule depends on the independence of sources involved in the combination. In this paper, we propose also a measure of independence, positive and negative dependence to integrate in mass functions before the combinaision with the independence assumption.",0
"This paper presents an ontology-based approach for the design of a collaborative business process model (CBP). This CBP is considered as a specification of needs in order to build a collaboration information system (CIS) for a network of organisations. The study is a part of a model driven engineering approach of the CIS in a specific enterprise interoperability framework that will be summarised. An adaptation of the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is used to represent the CBP model. We develop a knowledge-based system (KbS) which is composed of three main parts: knowledge gathering, knowledge representation and reasoning, and collaborative business process modelling. The first part starts from a high abstraction level where knowledge from business partners is captured. A collaboration ontology is defined in order to provide a structure to store and use the knowledge captured. In parallel, we try to reuse generic existing knowledge about business processes from the MIT Process Handbook repository. This results in a collaboration process ontology that is also described. A set of rules is defined in order to extract knowledge about fragments of the CBP model from the two previous ontologies. These fragments are finally assembled in the third part of the KbS. A prototype of the KbS has been developed in order to implement and support this approach. The prototype is a computer-aided design tool of the CBP. In this paper, we will present the theoretical aspects of each part of this KbS as well as the tools that we developed and used in order to support its functionalities.",0
"Relational Continuous Models (RCMs) represent joint probability densities over attributes of objects, when the attributes have continuous domains. With relational representations, they can model joint probability distributions over large numbers of variables compactly in a natural way. This paper presents a new exact lifted inference algorithm for RCMs, thus it scales up to large models of real world applications. The algorithm applies to Relational Pairwise Models which are (relational) products of potentials of arity 2. Our algorithm is unique in two ways. First, it substantially improves the efficiency of lifted inference with variables of continuous domains. When a relational model has Gaussian potentials, it takes only linear-time compared to cubic time of previous methods. Second, it is the first exact inference algorithm which handles RCMs in a lifted way. The algorithm is illustrated over an example from econometrics. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms both a groundlevel inference algorithm and an algorithm built with previously-known lifted methods.",0
"For widespread deployment in domains characterized by partial observability, non-deterministic actions and unforeseen changes, robots need to adapt sensing, processing and interaction with humans to the tasks at hand. While robots typically cannot process all sensor inputs or operate without substantial domain knowledge, it is a challenge to provide accurate domain knowledge and humans may not have the time and expertise to provide elaborate and accurate feedback. The architecture described in this paper combines declarative programming and probabilistic reasoning to address these challenges, enabling robots to: (a) represent and reason with incomplete domain knowledge, resolving ambiguities and revising existing knowledge using sensor inputs and minimal human feedback; and (b) probabilistically model the uncertainty in sensor input processing and navigation. Specifically, Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative programming paradigm, is combined with hierarchical partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), using domain knowledge to revise probabilistic beliefs, and using positive and negative observations for early termination of tasks that can no longer be pursued. All algorithms are evaluated in simulation and on mobile robots locating target objects in indoor domains.",0
"The human reasoning process is seldom a one-way process from an input leading to an output. Instead, it often involves a systematic deduction by ruling out other possible outcomes as a self-checking mechanism. In this paper, we describe the design of a hybrid neural network for logical learning that is similar to the human reasoning through the introduction of an auxiliary input, namely the indicators, that act as the hints to suggest logical outcomes. We generate these indicators by digging into the hidden information buried underneath the original training data for direct or indirect suggestions. We used the MNIST data to demonstrate the design and use of these indicators in a convolutional neural network. We trained a series of such hybrid neural networks with variations of the indicators. Our results show that these hybrid neural networks are very robust in generating logical outcomes with inherently higher prediction accuracy than the direct use of the original input and output in apparent models. Such improved predictability with reassured logical confidence is obtained through the exhaustion of all possible indicators to rule out all illogical outcomes, which is not available in the apparent models. Our logical learning process can effectively cope with the unknown unknowns using a full exploitation of all existing knowledge available for learning. The design and implementation of the hints, namely the indicators, become an essential part of artificial intelligence for logical learning. We also introduce an ongoing application setup for this hybrid neural network in an autonomous grasping robot, namely as_DeepClaw, aiming at learning an optimized grasping pose through logical learning.",0
"The monitoring and control of any dynamic system depends crucially on the ability to reason about its current status and its future trajectory. In the case of a stochastic system, these tasks typically involve the use of a belief state- a probability distribution over the state of the process at a given point in time. Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very large, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented compactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable. We investigate the idea of maintaining a compact approximation to the true belief state, and analyze the conditions under which the errors due to the approximations taken over the lifetime of the process do not accumulate to make our answers completely irrelevant. We show that the error in a belief state contracts exponentially as the process evolves. Thus, even with multiple approximations, the error in our process remains bounded indefinitely. We show how the additional structure of a DBN can be used to design our approximation scheme, improving its performance significantly. We demonstrate the applicability of our ideas in the context of a monitoring task, showing that orders of magnitude faster inference can be achieved with only a small degradation in accuracy.",0
"Conversations abound with uncetainties of various kinds. Treating conversation as inference and decision making under uncertainty, we propose a task independent, multimodal architecture for supporting robust continuous spoken dialog called Quartet. We introduce four interdependent levels of analysis, and describe representations, inference procedures, and decision strategies for managing uncertainties within and between the levels. We highlight the approach by reviewing interactions between a user and two spoken dialog systems developed using the Quartet architecture: Prsenter, a prototype system for navigating Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, and the Bayesian Receptionist, a prototype system for dealing with tasks typically handled by front desk receptionists at the Microsoft corporate campus.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful modeling formalism for combinatorial problems. However, writing ASP models is not trivial. We propose a novel method, called Sketched Answer Set Programming (SkASP), aiming at supporting the user in resolving this issue. The user writes an ASP program while marking uncertain parts open with question marks. In addition, the user provides a number of positive and negative examples of the desired program behaviour. The sketched model is rewritten into another ASP program, which is solved by traditional methods. As a result, the user obtains a functional and reusable ASP program modelling her problem. We evaluate our approach on 21 well known puzzles and combinatorial problems inspired by Karp's 21 NP-complete problems and demonstrate a use-case for a database application based on ASP.",0
"Human intuition has been simulated by several research projects using artificial intelligence techniques. Most of these algorithms or models lack the ability to handle complications or diversions. Moreover, they also do not explain the factors influencing intuition and the accuracy of the results from this process. In this paper, we present a simple series based model for implementation of human-like intuition using the principles of connectivity and unknown entities. By using Poker hand datasets and Car evaluation datasets, we compare the performance of some well-known models with our intuition model. The aim of the experiment was to predict the maximum accurate answers using intuition based models. We found that the presence of unknown entities, diversion from the current problem scenario, and identifying weakness without the normal logic based execution, greatly affects the reliability of the answers. Generally, the intuition based models cannot be a substitute for the logic based mechanisms in handling such problems. The intuition can only act as a support for an ongoing logic based model that processes all the steps in a sequential manner. However, when time and computational cost are very strict constraints, this intuition based model becomes extremely important and useful, because it can give a reasonably good performance. Factors affecting intuition are analyzed and interpreted through our model.",0
"The computation and storage requirements for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are usually high. This issue limit their deployability on ubiquitous computing devices such as smart phones or wearables. In this paper, we propose ternary neural networks (TNNs) in order to make deep learning more resource-efficient. We train these TNNs using a teacher-student approach. Using only ternary weights and ternary neurons, with a step activation function of two-thresholds, the student ternary network learns to mimic the behaviour of its teacher network. We propose a novel, layer-wise greedy methodology for training TNNs. During training, a ternary neural network inherently prunes the smaller weights by setting them to zero. This makes them even more compact thus more resource-friendly. We devise a purpose-built hardware design for TNNs and implement it on FPGA. The benchmark results with our purpose-built hardware running TNNs reveal that, with only 1.24 microjoules per image, we can achieve 97.76% accuracy with 5.37 microsecond latency and with a rate of 255K images per second on MNIST.",0
"Time-efficient link discovery is of central importance to implement the vision of the Semantic Web. Some of the most rapid Link Discovery approaches rely internally on planning to execute link specifications. In newer works, linear models have been used to estimate the runtime the fastest planners. However, no other category of models has been studied for this purpose so far. In this paper, we study non-linear runtime estimation functions for runtime estimation. In particular, we study exponential and mixed models for the estimation of the runtimes of planners. To this end, we evaluate three different models for runtime on six datasets using 400 link specifications. We show that exponential and mixed models achieve better fits when trained but are only to be preferred in some cases. Our evaluation also shows that the use of better runtime approximation models has a positive impact on the overall execution of link specifications.",0
"Outlier detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging yet important task, as it has applications in, e.g., fraud detection and quality control. State-of-the-art density-based algorithms perform well because they 1) take the local neighbourhoods of data points into account and 2) consider feature subspaces. In highly complex and high-dimensional data, however, existing methods are likely to overlook important outliers because they do not explicitly take into account that the data is often a mixture distribution of multiple components.",0
"We outline a method to estimate the value of computation for a flexible algorithm using empirical data. To determine a reasonable trade-off between cost and value, we build an empirical model of the value obtained through computation, and apply this model to estimate the value of computation for quite different problems. In particular, we investigate this trade-off for the problem of constructing policies for decision problems represented as influence diagrams. We show how two features of our anytime algorithm provide reasonable estimates of the value of computation in this domain.",0
This paper discusses the root cause of systems perceiving the self experience and how to exploit adaptive and learning features without introducing ethically problematic system properties.,0
"Bayesian belief networks are bing increasingly used as a knowledge representation for diagnostic reasoning. One simple method for conducting diagnostic reasoning is to represent system faults and observations only. In this paper, we investigate how having intermediate nodes-nodes other than fault and observation nodes affects the diagnostic performance of a Bayesian belief network. We conducted a series of experiments on a set of real belief networks for medical diagnosis in liver and bile disease. We compared the effects on diagnostic performance of a two-level network consisting just of disease and finding nodes with that of a network which models intermediate pathophysiological disease states as well. We provide some theoretical evidence for differences observed between the abstracted two-level network and the full network.",0
"This paper continues the research that considers a new cognitive model. In particular, it considers the neural binding structure of an earlier paper. To help with this, the paper describes some new methods in the areas of image processing and high-level behaviour simulation. The work is all based on earlier research by the author and the new additions are intended to fit in with the overall design. For image processing, a grid-like structure is used with 'full linking'. Each cell in the classifier grid stores a list of all other cells it gets associated with and this is used as the learned image that new input is compared to. For the behaviour metric, a new prediction equation is suggested, as part of a simulation, that uses feedback and history to dynamically determine its course of action. While the new methods are from widely different topics, both can be compared with the binary-analog type of interface that is the main focus of the paper. It is suggested that the simplest of linking between a tree and ensemble can explain neural binding and variable signal strengths.",0
"Intelligent systems sometimes need to infer the probable goals of people, cars, and robots, based on partial observations of their motion. This paper introduces a class of probabilistic programs for formulating and solving these problems. The formulation uses randomized path planning algorithms as the basis for probabilistic models of the process by which autonomous agents plan to achieve their goals. Because these path planning algorithms do not have tractable likelihood functions, new inference algorithms are needed. This paper proposes two Monte Carlo techniques for these ""likelihood-free"" models, one of which can use likelihood estimates from neural networks to accelerate inference. The paper demonstrates efficacy on three simple examples, each using under 50 lines of probabilistic code.",0
"Procedural content generation (PCG) is of great interest to game design and development as it generates game content automatically. Motivated by the recent learning-based PCG framework and other existing PCG works, we propose an alternative approach to online content generation and adaptation in Super Mario Bros (SMB). Unlike most of existing works in SMB, our approach exploits the synergy between rule-based and learning-based methods to produce constructive primitives, quality yet controllable game segments in SMB. As a result, a complete quality game level can be generated online by integrating relevant constructive primitives via controllable parameters regarding geometrical features and procedure-level properties. Also the adaptive content can be generated in real time by dynamically selecting proper constructive primitives via an adaptation criterion, e.g., dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our approach is of several favorable properties in terms of content quality assurance, generation efficiency and controllability. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate controllable yet quality game levels online and adaptable content for DDA in real time.",0
"In many cases, government data is still ""locked"" in several ""data silos"", even within the boundaries of a single (inter-)national public organization with disparate and distributed organizational units and departments spread across multiple sites. Opening data and enabling its unified querying from a single site in an efficient and effective way is a semantic application integration and open government data challenge. This paper describes how NARA is using Semantic Web technology to implement an application integration approach within the boundaries of its organization via opening and querying multiple governmental data sources from a single site. The generic approach proposed, namely S3-AI, provides support to answering unified, ontology-mediated, federated queries to data produced and exploited by disparate applications, while these are being located in different organizational sites. S3-AI preserves ownership, autonomy and independency of applications and data. The paper extensively demonstrates S3-AI, using the D2RQ and Fuseki technologies, for addressing the needs of a governmental ""IT helpdesk support"" case.",0
"We give algorithms with provable guarantees that learn a class of deep nets in the generative model view popularized by Hinton and others. Our generative model is an $n$ node multilayer neural net that has degree at most $n^{\gamma}$ for some $\gamma &lt;1$ and each edge has a random edge weight in $[-1,1]$. Our algorithm learns {\em almost all} networks in this class with polynomial running time. The sample complexity is quadratic or cubic depending upon the details of the model.",1
"Ensemble methods, such as stacking, are designed to boost predictive accuracy by blending the predictions of multiple machine learning models. Recent work has shown that the use of meta-features, additional inputs describing each example in a dataset, can boost the performance of ensemble methods, but the greatest reported gains have come from nonlinear procedures requiring significant tuning and training time. Here, we present a linear technique, Feature-Weighted Linear Stacking (FWLS), that incorporates meta-features for improved accuracy while retaining the well-known virtues of linear regression regarding speed, stability, and interpretability. FWLS combines model predictions linearly using coefficients that are themselves linear functions of meta-features. This technique was a key facet of the solution of the second place team in the recently concluded Netflix Prize competition. Significant increases in accuracy over standard linear stacking is demonstrated on the Netflix Prize collaborative filtering dataset.",0
"Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern cosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed to address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of distant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various unavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the accuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains an open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To this end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in generating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on conditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective for training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable alternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for generating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological surveys.",1
"Recruiters usually spend less than a minute looking at each r\'esum\'e when deciding whether it's worth continuing the recruitment process with the candidate. Recruiters focus on keywords, and it's almost impossible to guarantee a fair process of candidate selection. The main scope of this paper is to tackle this issue by introducing a data-driven approach that shows how to process r\'esum\'es automatically and give recruiters more time to only examine promising candidates. Furthermore, we show how to leverage Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing in order to extract all required information from the r\'esum\'es. Once the information is extracted, a ranking score is calculated. The score describes how well the candidates fit based on their education, work experience and skills. Later this paper illustrates a prototype application that shows how this novel approach can increase the productivity of recruiters. The application enables them to filter and rank candidates based on predefined job descriptions. Guided by the ranking, recruiters can get deeper insights from candidate profiles and validate why and how the application ranked them. This application shows how to improve the hiring process by giving an unbiased hiring decision support.",0
"We present a new approach to the solution of decision problems formulated as influence diagrams. The approach converts the influence diagram into a simpler structure, the LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID), where only the requisite information for the computation of optimal policies is depicted. Because the requisite information is explicitly represented in the diagram, the evaluation procedure can take advantage of it. In this paper we show how to convert an influence diagram to a LIMID and describe the procedure for finding an optimal strategy. Our approach can yield significant savings of memory and computational time when compared to traditional methods.",0
"We explain how the prototype automatic chess problem composer, Chesthetica, successfully composed a rare and interesting chess problem using the new Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) computational creativity approach. This problem represents a greater challenge from a creative standpoint because the checkmate is not always clear and the method of winning even less so. Creating a decisive chess problem of this type without the aid of an omniscient 7-piece endgame tablebase (and one that also abides by several chess composition conventions) would therefore be a challenge for most human players and composers working on their own. The fact that a small computer with relatively low processing power and memory was sufficient to compose such a problem using the DSNS approach in just 10 days is therefore noteworthy. In this report we document the event and result in some detail. It lends additional credence to the DSNS as a viable new approach in the field of computational creativity. In particular, in areas where human-like creativity is required for targeted or specific problems with no clear path to the solution.",0
"This report provides an overview of the current state of the art deep learning architectures and optimisation techniques, and uses the ADNI hippocampus MRI dataset as an example to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of different convolutional architectures on the task of patch-based 3-dimensional hippocampal segmentation, which is important in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. We found that a slightly unconventional ""stacked 2D"" approach provides much better classification performance than simple 2D patches without requiring significantly more computational power. We also examined the popular ""tri-planar"" approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement.",0
"This research applies ideas from argumentation theory in the context of semantic wikis, aiming to provide support for structured-large scale argumentation between human agents. The implemented prototype is exemplified by modelling the MMR vaccine controversy.",0
"Most recent MaxSAT algorithms rely on a succession of calls to a SAT solver in order to find an optimal solution. In particular, several algorithms take advantage of the ability of SAT solvers to identify unsatisfiable subformulas. Usually, these MaxSAT algorithms perform better when small unsatisfiable subformulas are found early. However, this is not the case in many problem instances, since the whole formula is given to the SAT solver in each call. In this paper, we propose to partition the MaxSAT formula using a resolution-based graph representation. Partitions are then iteratively joined by using a proximity measure extracted from the graph representation of the formula. The algorithm ends when only one partition remains and the optimal solution is found. Experimental results show that this new approach further enhances a state of the art MaxSAT solver to optimally solve a larger set of industrial problem instances.",0
"Small wind projects encounter difficulties to be efficiently deployed, partly because wrong way data and information are managed. Ontologies can overcome the drawbacks of partially available, noisy, inconsistent, and heterogeneous data sources, by providing a semantic middleware between low level data and more general knowledge. In this paper, we engineer an ontology for the wind energy domain using description logic as technical instrumentation. We aim to integrate corpus of heterogeneous knowledge, both digital and human, in order to help the interested user to speed-up the initialization of a small-scale wind project. We exemplify one use case scenario of our ontology, that consists of automatically checking whether a planned wind project is compliant or not with the active regulations.",0
"We study the computational complexity of committee selection problem for several approval-based voting rules in the presence of outliers. Our first result shows that outlier consideration makes committee selection problem intractable for approval, net approval, and minisum approval voting rules. We then study parameterized complexity of this problem with five natural parameters, namely the target score, the size of the committee (and its dual parameter, the number of candidates outside the committee), the number of outliers (and its dual parameter, the number of non-outliers). For net approval and minisum approval voting rules, we provide a dichotomous result, resolving the parameterized complexity of this problem for all subsets of five natural parameters considered (by showing either FPT or W[1]-hardness for all subsets of parameters). For the approval voting rule, we resolve the parameterized complexity of this problem for all subsets of parameters except one.",0
"Efficient use of multiple batteries is a practical problem with wide and growing application. The problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty.

"In this position paper we present a novel approach to neurobiologically plausible implementation of emotional reactions and behaviors for real-time autonomous robotic systems. The working metaphor we use is the ""day"" and ""night"" phases of mammalian life. During the ""day"" phase a robotic system stores the inbound information and is controlled by a light-weight rule-based system in real time. In contrast to that, during the ""night"" phase the stored information is been transferred to the supercomputing system to update the realistic neural network: emotional and behavioral strategies.",0
"Concerns over the risks associated with advances in Artificial Intelligence have prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI, including machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating the development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally, evaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices. This emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years. However, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging field of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily facilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show that it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves competitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific AI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make unethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee the responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we conclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of engineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by legislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to increase the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.",0
"The main idea of this paper is to represent shopping items through vectors because these vectors act as the base for building em- beddings for customers and shopping carts. Also, these vectors are input to the mathematical models that act as either a recommendation engine or help in targeting potential customers. We have used exponential family embeddings as the tool to construct two basic vectors - product embeddings and context vectors. Using the basic vectors, we build combined embeddings, trip embeddings and customer embeddings. Combined embeddings mix linguistic properties of product names with their shopping patterns. The customer embeddings establish an understand- ing of the buying pattern of customers in a group and help in building customer profile. For example a customer profile can represent customers frequently buying pet-food. Identifying such profiles can help us bring out offers and discounts. Similarly, trip embeddings are used to build trip profiles. People happen to buy similar set of products in a trip and hence their trip embeddings can be used to predict the next product they would like to buy. This is a novel technique and the first of its kind to make recommendation using product, trip and customer embeddings.",0
"Path planning is one of the most vital elements of mobile robotics, providing the agent with a collision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be calculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A* search method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that minimizes the path cost. D* is widely used for its dynamic replanning capabilities. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize the distance traversed from start to goal, but many mobile robot applications call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem. Common search algorithms, e.g. A* and D*, are not well suited for MOO problems, yielding suboptimal results. The search algorithm presented in this paper is designed for optimal MOO path planning. The algorithm incorporates Pareto optimality into D*, and is thus named D*-PO. Non-dominated solution paths are guaranteed by calculating the Pareto front at each search step. Simulations were run to model a planetary exploration rover in a Mars environment, with five path costs. The results show the new, Pareto optimal D*-PO outperforms the traditional A* and D* algorithms for MOO path planning.",0
"We systematically investigate the complexity of model checking the existential positive fragment of first-order logic. In particular, for a set of existential positive sentences, we consider model checking where the sentence is restricted to fall into the set; a natural question is then to classify which sentence sets are tractable and which are intractable. We give a general theorem that, for different representations of structures, reduces this classification question to the corresponding question for primitive positive logic. This general theorem allows us to deduce that an existential positive sentence set having bounded arity is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if each sentence is equivalent to one in bounded-variable logic. We then use the lens of classical complexity to study these fixed-parameter tractable sentence sets. We show that such a set can be NP-complete, and consider the length needed by a translation from sentences in such a set to bounded-variable logic; we prove superpolynomial lower bounds on this length using the theory of compilability, obtaining an interesting type of formula size lower bound. Overall, the tools, concepts, and results of this article set the stage for the future consideration of the complexity of model checking on more expressive logics.",0
"The causal structure of cognition can be simulated but not implemented computationally, just as the causal structure of a comet can be simulated but not implemented computationally. The only thing that allows us even to imagine otherwise is that cognition, unlike a comet, is invisible (to all but the cognizer).",0
"Realizability for knowledge representation formalisms studies the following question: given a semantics and a set of interpretations, is there a knowledge base whose semantics coincides exactly with the given interpretation set? We introduce a general framework for analyzing realizability in abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) and various of its subclasses. In particular, the framework applies to Dung argumentation frameworks, SETAFs by Nielsen and Parsons, and bipolar ADFs. We present a uniform characterization method for the admissible, complete, preferred and model/stable semantics. We employ this method to devise an algorithm that decides realizability for the mentioned formalisms and semantics; moreover the algorithm allows for constructing a desired knowledge base whenever one exists. The algorithm is built in a modular way and thus easily extensible to new formalisms and semantics. We have also implemented our approach in answer set programming, and used the implementation to obtain several novel results on the relative expressiveness of the abovementioned formalisms.",0
"Concept Trees are a type of database that can organise arbitrary textual information using a very simple rule. Each tree tries to represent a single cohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation and semantic purposes. The trees are therefore a type of semantic network and would benefit from having a consistent level of context for each of the nodes. The Concept Tree nodes have a mathematical basis allowing for a consistent build process. These would represent nouns or verbs in a text sentence, for example. New to the design can then be lists of descriptive elements for each of the nodes. The descriptors can also be weighted, but do not have to follow the strict counting rule of the tree nodes. With the new descriptive layers, a much richer type of knowledge can be achieved and still reasoned over automatically. The linking structure of the licas network is very relevant to building the concept trees now and forms the basis for their construction. The concept tree - symbolic neural network relation is also extended further.",0
Multi-start algorithms are a common and effective tool for metaheuristic searches. In this paper we amplify multi-start capabilities by employing the parallel processing power of the graphics processer unit (GPU) to quickly generate a diverse starting set of solutions for the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Optimization Problem which are evaluated and used to implement screening methods to select solutions for further optimization. This method is implemented as an initial high quality solution generation phase prior to a secondary steepest ascent search and a comparison of results to best known approaches on benchmark unconstrained binary quadratic problems demonstrates that GPU-enabled diversified multi-start with screening quickly yields very good results.,0
"Artificial neural networks are powerful models, which have been widely applied into many aspects of machine translation, such as language modeling and translation modeling. Though notable improvements have been made in these areas, the reordering problem still remains a challenge in statistical machine translations. In this paper, we present a novel neural reordering model that directly models word pairs and alignment. By utilizing LSTM recurrent neural networks, much longer context could be learned for reordering prediction. Experimental results on NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English and Chinese-English 1000-best rescoring task show that our LSTM neural reordering feature is robust and achieves significant improvements over various baseline systems.",1
"In this paper we present an algorithm to build a road network map enriched with traffic rules such as one-way streets and forbidden turns, based on the interpretation of already detected and classified traffic signs. Such algorithm helps to automatize the elaboration of maps for commercial navigation systems. Our solution is based on simulating navigation along the road network, determining at each point of interest the visibility of the signs and their effect on the roads. We test our approach in a small urban network and discuss various ways to generalize it to support more complex environments.",0
"A fundamental question in Computer Science is understanding when a specific class of problems go from being computationally easy to hard. Because of its generality and applications, the problem of Boolean Satisfiability (aka SAT) is often used as a vehicle for investigating this question. A signal result from these studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic easy-to-hard phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past studies have however focused mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform random distributions, where all constraints are independently generated, and the problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These assumptions are unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a deeper understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. We study two key questions: (i) How does easy-to-hard transition change with more realistic distributions that capture neighborhood sensitivity and rich-get-richer aspects of real problems and (ii) Can these changes be explained in terms of the network properties (such as node centrality and small-worldness) of the clausal networks of the SAT problems. Our results, based on extensive empirical studies and network analyses, provide important structural and computational insights into realistic SAT problems. Our extensive empirical studies show that SAT instances from realistic distributions do exhibit phase transition, but the transition occurs sooner (at lower values of constrainedness) than the instances from uniform random distribution. We show that this behavior can be explained in terms of their clausal network properties such as eigenvector centrality and small-worldness (measured indirectly in terms of the clustering coefficients and average node distance).",1
"Bayesian knowledge bases (BKBs) are a generalization of Bayes networks and weighted proof graphs (WAODAGs), that allow cycles in the causal graph. Reasoning in BKBs requires finding the most probable inferences consistent with the evidence. The cost-sharing heuristic for finding least-cost explanations in WAODAGs was presented and shown to be effective by Charniak and Husain. However, the cycles in BKBs would make the definition of cost-sharing cyclic as well, if applied directly to BKBs. By treating the defining equations of cost-sharing as a system of equations, one can properly define an admissible cost-sharing heuristic for BKBs. Empirical evaluation shows that cost-sharing improves performance significantly when applied to BKBs.",0
Information on the web is prodigious; searching relevant information is difficult making web users to rely on search engines for finding relevant information on the web. Search engines index and categorize web pages according to their contents using crawlers and rank them accordingly. For given user query they retrieve millions of webpages and display them to users according to web-page rank. Every search engine has their own algorithms based on certain parameters for ranking web-pages. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is that technique by which webmasters try to improve ranking of their websites by optimizing it according to search engines ranking parameters. It is the aim of this research to identify the most popular SEO techniques used by search engines for ranking web-pages and to establish their importance for indexing and categorizing web data. The research tries to establish that using more SEO parameters in ranking algorithms helps in retrieving better search results thus increasing user satisfaction.,0
"We introduce Deep Neural Programs (DNP), a novel programming paradigm for writing adaptive controllers for cy-ber-physical systems (CPS). DNP replace if and while statements, whose discontinuity is responsible for undecidability in CPS analysis, intractability in CPS design, and frailness in CPS implementation, with their smooth, neural nif and nwhile counterparts. This not only makes CPS analysis decidable and CPS design tractable, but also allows to write robust and adaptive CPS code. In DNP the connection between the sigmoidal guards of the nif and nwhile statements has to be given as a Gaussian Bayesian network, which reflects the partial knowledge, the CPS program has about its environment. To the best of our knowledge, DNP are the first approach linking neural networks to programs, in a way that makes explicit the meaning of the network. In order to prove and validate the usefulness of DNP, we use them to write and learn an adaptive CPS controller for the parallel parking of the Pioneer rovers available in our CPS lab.",0
"There is increasing awareness in the planning community that depending on complete models impedes the applicability of planning technology in many real world domains where the burden of specifying complete domain models is too high. In this paper, we consider a novel solution for this challenge that combines generative planning on incomplete domain models with a library of plan cases that are known to be correct. While this was arguably the original motivation for case-based planning, most existing case-based planners assume (and depend on) from-scratch planners that work on complete domain models. In contrast, our approach views the plan generated with respect to the incomplete model as a ""skeletal plan"" and augments it with directed mining of plan fragments from library cases. We will present the details of our approach and present an empirical evaluation of our method in comparison to a state-of-the-art case-based planner that depends on complete domain models.",1
"Possibilistic conditional independence is investigated: we propose a definition of this notion similar to the one used in probability theory. The links between independence and non-interactivity are investigated, and properties of these relations are given. The influence of the conjunction used to define a conditional measure of possibility is also highlighted: we examine three types of conjunctions: Lukasiewicz - like T-norms, product-like T-norms and the minimum operator.",0
"Collecting and maintaining accurate world knowledge in a dynamic, complex, adversarial, and stochastic environment such as the RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation is a challenging task. Knowledge should be learned in real-time with time constraints. We use recently introduced Off-Policy Gradient Descent algorithms within Reinforcement Learning that illustrate learnable knowledge representations for dynamic role assignments. The results show that the agents have learned competitive policies against the top teams from the RoboCup 2012 competitions for three vs three, five vs five, and seven vs seven agents. We have explicitly used subsets of agents to identify the dynamics and the semantics for which the agents learn to maximize their performance measures, and to gather knowledge about different objectives, so that all agents participate effectively and efficiently within the group.",0
"Fuzzy Description Logics (FDLs) are logic-based formalisms used to represent and reason with vague or imprecise knowledge. It has been recently shown that reasoning in most FDLs using truth values from the interval [0,1] becomes undecidable in the presence of a negation constructor and general concept inclusion axioms. One exception to this negative result are FDLs whose semantics is based on the infinitely valued G\""odel t-norm (G). In this paper, we extend previous decidability results for G-IALC to deal also with qualified number restrictions. Our novel approach is based on a combination of the known crispification technique for finitely valued FDLs and the automata-based procedure originally developed for reasoning in G-IALC. The proposed approach combines the advantages of these two methods, while removing their respective drawbacks.",0
"The optimal allocation of resources for maximizing influence, spread of information or coverage, has gained attention in the past years, in particular in machine learning and data mining. But, in applications, the parameters of the problem are rarely known exactly, and using wrong parameters can lead to undesirable outcomes. We hence revisit a continuous version of the Budget Allocation or Bipartite Influence Maximization problem introduced by Alon et al. (2012) from a robust optimization perspective, where an adversary may choose the least favorable parameters within a confidence set. The resulting problem is a nonconvex-concave saddle point problem (or game). We show that this nonconvex problem can be solved exactly by leveraging connections to continuous submodular functions, and by solving a constrained submodular minimization problem. Although constrained submodular minimization is hard in general, here, we establish conditions under which such a problem can be solved to arbitrary precision $\epsilon$.",1
"Bandwidth allocation is a fundamental problem in communication networks. With current network moving towards the Future Internet model, the problem is further intensified as network traffic demanding far from exceeds network bandwidth capability. Maintaining a certain user satisfaction degree therefore becomes a challenge research topic. In this paper, we deal with the problem by proposing BASMIN, a novel bandwidth allocation scheme that aims to maximize network user's happiness. We also defined a new metric for evaluating network user satisfaction degree: network worth. A three-step evaluation process is then conducted to compare BASMIN efficiency with other three popular bandwidth allocation schemes. Throughout the tests, we experienced BASMIN's advantages over the others; we even found out that one of the most widely used bandwidth allocation schemes, in fact, is not effective at all.",0
"This paper studies convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn unsupervised feature representations for 44 different plant species, collected at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England. To gain intuition on the chosen features from the CNN model (opposed to a 'black box' solution), a visualisation technique based on the deconvolutional networks (DN) is utilized. It is found that venations of different order have been chosen to uniquely represent each of the plant species. Experimental results using these CNN features with different classifiers show consistency and superiority compared to the state-of-the art solutions which rely on hand-crafted features.",0
"We present a new type of probabilistic model which we call DISsimilarity COefficient Networks (DISCO Nets). DISCO Nets allow us to efficiently sample from a posterior distribution parametrised by a neural network. During training, DISCO Nets are learned by minimising the dissimilarity coefficient between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. This allows us to tailor the training to the loss related to the task at hand. We empirically show that (i) by modeling uncertainty on the output value, DISCO Nets outperform equivalent non-probabilistic predictive networks and (ii) DISCO Nets accurately model the uncertainty of the output, outperforming existing probabilistic models based on deep neural networks.",1
"The brain's self-monitoring of activities, including internal activities -- a functionality that we refer to as awareness -- has been suggested as a key element of consciousness. Here we investigate whether the presence of an inner-eye-like process (monitor) that supervises the activities of a number of subsystems (operative agents) engaged in the solution of a problem can improve the problem-solving efficiency of the system. The problem is to find the global maximum of a NK fitness landscape and the performance is measured by the time required to find that maximum. The operative agents explore blindly the fitness landscape and the monitor provides them with feedback on the quality (fitness) of the proposed solutions. This feedback is then used by the operative agents to bias their searches towards the fittest regions of the landscape. We find that a weak feedback between the monitor and the operative agents improves the performance of the system, regardless of the difficulty of the problem, which is gauged by the number of local maxima in the landscape. For easy problems (i.e., landscapes without local maxima), the performance improves monotonically as the feedback strength increases, but for difficult problems, there is an optimal value of the feedback strength beyond which the system performance degrades very rapidly.",0
"We present the first general purpose framework for marginal maximum a posteriori estimation of probabilistic program variables. By using a series of code transformations, the evidence of any probabilistic program, and therefore of any graphical model, can be optimized with respect to an arbitrary subset of its sampled variables. To carry out this optimization, we develop the first Bayesian optimization package to directly exploit the source code of its target, leading to innovations in problem-independent hyperpriors, unbounded optimization, and implicit constraint satisfaction; delivering significant performance improvements over prominent existing packages. We present applications of our method to a number of tasks including engineering design and parameter optimization.",1
"The modelling, analysis, and visualisation of dynamic geospatial phenomena has been identified as a key developmental challenge for next-generation Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

"Argumentation is a process of evaluating and comparing a set of arguments. A way to compare them consists in using a ranking-based semantics which rank-order arguments from the most to the least acceptable ones. Recently, a number of such semantics have been proposed independently, often associated with some desirable properties. However, there is no comparative study which takes a broader perspective. This is what we propose in this work. We provide a general comparison of all these semantics with respect to the proposed properties. That allows to underline the differences of behavior between the existing semantics.",1
"Although agreement between annotators has been studied in the past from a statistical viewpoint, little work has attempted to quantify the extent to which this phenomenon affects the evaluation of computer vision (CV) object detection algorithms. Many researchers utilise ground truth (GT) in experiments and more often than not this GT is derived from one annotator's opinion. How does the difference in opinion affect an algorithm's evaluation? Four examples of typical CV problems are chosen, and a methodology is applied to each to quantify the inter-annotator variance and to offer insight into the mechanisms behind agreement and the use of GT. It is found that when detecting linear objects annotator agreement is very low. The agreement in object position, linear or otherwise, can be partially explained through basic image properties. Automatic object detectors are compared to annotator agreement and it is found that a clear relationship exists. Several methods for calculating GTs from a number of annotations are applied and the resulting differences in the performance of the object detectors are quantified. It is found that the rank of a detector is highly dependent upon the method used to form the GT. It is also found that although the STAPLE and LSML GT estimation methods appear to represent the mean of the performance measured using the individual annotations, when there are few annotations, or there is a large variance in them, these estimates tend to degrade. Furthermore, one of the most commonly adopted annotation combination methods--consensus voting--accentuates more obvious features, which results in an overestimation of the algorithm's performance. Finally, it is concluded that in some datasets it may not be possible to state with any confidence that one algorithm outperforms another when evaluating upon one GT and a method for calculating confidence bounds is discussed.",0
"We introduce the Self-Adaptive Goal Generation - Robust Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (SAGG-RIAC) architecture as an intrinsi- cally motivated goal exploration mechanism which allows active learning of inverse models in high-dimensional redundant robots. This allows a robot to efficiently and actively learn distributions of parameterized motor skills/policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterized tasks/goals. The architecture makes the robot sample actively novel parameterized tasks in the task space, based on a measure of competence progress, each of which triggers low-level goal-directed learning of the motor policy pa- rameters that allow to solve it. For both learning and generalization, the system leverages regression techniques which allow to infer the motor policy parameters corresponding to a given novel parameterized task, and based on the previously learnt correspondences between policy and task parameters. We present experiments with high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor spaces in three different robotic setups: 1) learning the inverse kinematics in a highly-redundant robotic arm, 2) learning omnidirectional locomotion with motor primitives in a quadruped robot, 3) an arm learning to control a fishing rod with a flexible wire. We show that 1) exploration in the task space can be a lot faster than exploration in the actuator space for learning inverse models in redundant robots; 2) selecting goals maximizing competence progress creates developmental trajectories driving the robot to progressively focus on tasks of increasing complexity and is statistically significantly more efficient than selecting tasks randomly, as well as more efficient than different standard active motor babbling methods; 3) this architecture allows the robot to actively discover which parts of its task space it can learn to reach and which part it cannot.",0

"In this paper, we propose the Neural Knowledge DNA, a framework that tailors the ideas underlying the success of neural networks to the scope of knowledge representation. Knowledge representation is a fundamental field that dedicate to representing information about the world in a form that computer systems can utilize to solve complex tasks. The proposed Neural Knowledge DNA is designed to support discovering, storing, reusing, improving, and sharing knowledge among machines and organisation. It is constructed in a similar fashion of how DNA formed: built up by four essential elements. As the DNA produces phenotypes, the Neural Knowledge DNA carries information and knowledge via its four essential elements, namely, Networks, Experiences, States, and Actions.",0
"In this paper, we present a new algorithm for parallel Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). It is based on the pipeline pattern and allows flexible management of the control flow of the operations in parallel MCTS. The pipeline pattern provides for the first structured parallel programming approach to MCTS. Moreover, we propose a new lock-free tree data structure for parallel MCTS which removes synchronization overhead. The Pipeline Pattern for Parallel MCTS algorithm (called 3PMCTS), scales very well to higher numbers of cores when compared to the existing methods.",0

"Coalition formation is a fundamental type of interaction that involves the creation of coherent groupings of distinct, autonomous, agents in order to efficiently achieve their individual or collective goals. Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements.",0
"This paper presents a novel fixation prediction and saliency modeling framework based on inter-image similarities and ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). The proposed framework is inspired by two observations, 1) the contextual information of a scene along with low-level visual cues modulates attention, 2) the influence of scene memorability on eye movement patterns caused by the resemblance of a scene to a former visual experience. Motivated by such observations, we develop a framework that estimates the saliency of a given image using an ensemble of extreme learners, each trained on an image similar to the input image. That is, after retrieving a set of similar images for a given image, a saliency predictor is learnt from each of the images in the retrieved image set using an ELM, resulting in an ensemble. The saliency of the given image is then measured in terms of the mean of predicted saliency value by the ensemble's members.",0
"Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as Word2Vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name Item2Vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-to-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results on large scale datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show it provides a similarity measure that is competitive with SVD.",0
"Multi-step temporal-difference (TD) learning, where the update targets contain information from multiple time steps ahead, is one of the most popular forms of TD learning for linear function approximation. The reason is that multi-step methods often yield substantially better performance than their single-step counter-parts, due to a lower bias of the update targets. For non-linear function approximation, however, single-step methods appear to be the norm. Part of the reason could be that on many domains the popular multi-step methods TD($\lambda$) and Sarsa($\lambda$) do not perform well when combined with non-linear function approximation. In particular, they are very susceptible to divergence of value estimates. In this paper, we identify the reason behind this. Furthermore, based on our analysis, we propose a new multi-step TD method for non-linear function approximation that addresses this issue. We confirm the effectiveness of our method using two benchmark tasks with neural networks as function approximation.",0

"We investigate modal logics of high probability having two unary modal operators: an operator $K$ expressing probabilistic certainty and an operator $B$ expressing probability exceeding a fixed rational threshold $c\geq\frac 12$. Identifying knowledge with the former and belief with the latter, we may think of $c$ as the agent's betting threshold, which leads to the motto ""belief is willingness to bet."" The logic $\mathsf{KB.5}$ for $c=\frac 12$ has an $\mathsf{S5}$ $K$ modality along with a sub-normal $B$ modality that extends the minimal modal logic $\mathsf{EMND45}$ by way of four schemes relating $K$ and $B$, one of which is a complex scheme arising out of a theorem due to Scott. Lenzen was the first to use Scott's theorem to show that a version of this logic is sound and complete for the probability interpretation. We reformulate Lenzen's results and present them here in a modern and accessible form. In addition, we introduce a new epistemic neighborhood semantics that will be more familiar to modern modal logicians. Using Scott's theorem, we provide the Lenzen-derivative properties that must be imposed on finite epistemic neighborhood models so as to guarantee the existence of a probability measure respecting the neighborhood function in the appropriate way for threshold $c=\frac 12$. This yields a link between probabilistic and modal neighborhood semantics that we hope will be of use in future work on modal logics of qualitative probability. We leave open the question of which properties must be imposed on finite epistemic neighborhood models so as to guarantee existence of an appropriate probability measure for thresholds $c\neq\frac 12$.",0
"By discussing several examples, the theory of generalized functional models is shown to be very natural for modeling some situations of reasoning under uncertainty. A generalized functional model is a pair (f, P) where f is a function describing the interactions between a parameter variable, an observation variable and a random source, and P is a probability distribution for the random source. Unlike traditional functional models, generalized functional models do not require that there is only one value of the parameter variable that is compatible with an observation and a realization of the random source. As a consequence, the results of the analysis of a generalized functional model are not expressed in terms of probability distributions but rather by support and plausibility functions. The analysis of a generalized functional model is very logical and is inspired from ideas already put forward by R.A. Fisher in his theory of fiducial probability.",0
"Recommender systems play an increasingly important role in online applications to help users find what they need or prefer. Collaborative filtering algorithms that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a simple recommendation algorithm that fully exploits the similarity information among users and items and intrinsic structural information of the user-item matrix. The proposed method constructs a new representation which preserves affinity and structure information in the user-item rating matrix and then performs recommendation task. To capture proximity information about users and items, two graphs are constructed. Manifold learning idea is used to constrain the new representation to be smooth on these graphs, so as to enforce users and item proximities. Our model is formulated as a convex optimization problem, for which we need to solve the well-known Sylvester equation only. We carry out extensive empirical evaluations on six benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of this approach.",0
"We consider the task of aggregating beliefs of severalexperts. We assume that these beliefs are represented as probabilitydistributions. We argue that the evaluation of any aggregationtechnique depends on the semantic context of this task. We propose aframework, in which we assume that nature generates samples from a`true' distribution and different experts form their beliefs based onthe subsets of the data they have a chance to observe. Naturally, theideal aggregate distribution would be the one learned from thecombined sample sets. Such a formulation leads to a natural way tomeasure the accuracy of the aggregation mechanism.We show that the well-known aggregation operator LinOP is ideallysuited for that task. We propose a LinOP-based learning algorithm,inspired by the techniques developed for Bayesian learning, whichaggregates the experts' distributions represented as Bayesiannetworks. Our preliminary experiments show that this algorithmperforms well in practice.",0
"Inference in expressive probabilistic models is generally intractable, which makes them difficult to learn and limits their applicability. Sum-product networks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains tractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this paper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems: all those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This includes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration, and others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the factors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many previous results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time thus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and generality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured prediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally optimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms the standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.",1
"This article is an attempt to combine different ways of working with sets of objects and their classes for designing and development of artificial intelligent systems (AIS) of analysis information, using object-oriented programming (OOP). This paper contains analysis of basic concepts of OOP and their relation with set theory and artificial intelligence (AI). Process of sets and multisets creation from different sides, in particular mathematical set theory, OOP and AI is considered. Definition of object and its properties, homogeneous and inhomogeneous classes of objects, set of objects, multiset of objects and constructive methods of their creation and classification are proposed. In addition, necessity of some extension of existing OOP tools for the purpose of practical implementation AIS of analysis information, using proposed approach, is shown.",0
"Relational Markov Random Fields are a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the joint distribution over attributes of a large number of interacting entities. The main computational difficulty in learning such models is inference. Even when dealing with complete data, where one can summarize a large domain by sufficient statistics, learning requires one to compute the expectation of the sufficient statistics given different parameter choices. The typical solution to this problem is to resort to approximate inference procedures, such as loopy belief propagation. Although these procedures are quite efficient, they still require computation that is on the order of the number of interactions (or features) in the model. When learning a large relational model over a complex domain, even such approximations require unrealistic running time. In this paper we show that for a particular class of relational MRFs, which have inherent symmetry, we can perform the inference needed for learning procedures using a template-level belief propagation. This procedure's running time is proportional to the size of the relational model rather than the size of the domain. Moreover, we show that this computational procedure is equivalent to sychronous loopy belief propagation. This enables a dramatic speedup in inference and learning time. We use this procedure to learn relational MRFs for capturing the joint distribution of large protein-protein interaction networks.",0
"In the era of big data, k-means clustering has been widely adopted as a basic processing tool in various contexts. However, its computational cost could be prohibitively high as the data size and the cluster number are large. It is well known that the processing bottleneck of k-means lies in the operation of seeking closest centroid in each iteration. In this paper, a novel solution towards the scalability issue of k-means is presented. In the proposal, k-means is supported by an approximate k-nearest neighbors graph. In the k-means iteration, each data sample is only compared to clusters that its nearest neighbors reside. Since the number of nearest neighbors we consider is much less than k, the processing cost in this step becomes minor and irrelevant to k. The processing bottleneck is therefore overcome. The most interesting thing is that k-nearest neighbor graph is constructed by iteratively calling the fast $k$-means itself. Comparing with existing fast k-means variants, the proposed algorithm achieves hundreds to thousands times speed-up while maintaining high clustering quality. As it is tested on 10 million 512-dimensional data, it takes only 5.2 hours to produce 1 million clusters. In contrast, to fulfill the same scale of clustering, it would take 3 years for traditional k-means.",0
"A recent trend in probabilistic inference emphasizes the codification of models in a formal syntax, with suitable high-level features such as individuals, relations, and connectives, enabling descriptive clarity, succinctness and circumventing the need for the modeler to engineer a custom solver. Unfortunately, bringing these linguistic and pragmatic benefits to numerical optimization has proven surprisingly challenging. In this paper, we turn to these challenges: we introduce a rich modeling language, for which an interior-point method computes approximate solutions in a generic way. While logical features easily complicates the underlying model, often yielding intricate dependencies, we exploit and cache local structure using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Indeed, standard matrix-vector algebra is efficiently realizable in ADDs, but we argue and show that well-known optimization methods are not ideal for ADDs. Our engine, therefore, invokes a sophisticated matrix-free approach. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.",1
"Users who need several queries before finding what they need can benefit from an automatic search assistant that provides feedback on their query modification strategies. We present a method to learn from a search log which types of query modifications have and have not been effective in the past. The method analyses query modifications along two dimensions: a traditional term-based dimension and a semantic dimension, for which queries are enriches with linked data entities. Applying the method to the search logs of two search engines, we identify six opportunities for a query modification assistant to improve search: modification strategies that are commonly used, but that often do not lead to satisfactory results.",0

"In this paper we introduce Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS), an improvement to reduce error variance in Bayesian network importance sampling propagation under evidential reasoning. We prove the existence of a collection of importance functions that are close to the optimal importance function under evidential reasoning. Based on this theoretic result we derive the RIS algorithm. RIS approaches the optimal importance function by applying localized arc changes to minimize the divergence between the evidence-adjusted importance function and the optimal importance function. The validity and performance of RIS is empirically tested with a large setof synthetic Bayesian networks and two real-world networks.",0
"An overview of current debates and contemporary research devoted to the modeling of decision making processes and their facilitation directs attention to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). At the core of the AHP are various prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica 8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the quality of PRs estimation; however, solutions proposed in this paper can significantly improve the methodology.",0
"A model checker can produce a trace of counterexample, for an erroneous program, which is often long and difficult to understand. In general, the part about the loops is the largest among the instructions in this trace. This makes the location of errors in loops critical, to analyze errors in the overall program. In this paper, we explore the scala-bility capabilities of LocFaults, our error localization approach exploiting paths of CFG(Control Flow Graph) from a counterexample to calculate the MCDs (Minimal Correction Deviations), and MCSs (Minimal Correction Subsets) from each found MCD. We present the times of our approach on programs with While-loops unfolded b times, and a number of deviated conditions ranging from 0 to n. Our preliminary results show that the times of our approach, constraint-based and flow-driven, are better compared to BugAssist which is based on SAT and transforms the entire program to a Boolean formula, and further the information provided by LocFaults is more expressive for the user.",0
This paper analyses the influence of including agents of different degrees of intelligence in a multiagent system.

We further describe how symbolic techniques can provide information which can significantly reduce the computation required for computing all cause posterior marginals. Finally, we present a novel approximation technique with preliminary experimental results.",0
"Bike sharing systems are a very popular means to provide bikes to citizens in a simple and cheap way. The idea is to install bike stations at various points in the city, from which a registered user can easily loan a bike by removing it from a specialized rack. After the ride, the user may return the bike at any station (if there is a free rack). Services of this kind are mainly public or semi-public, often aimed at increasing the attractiveness of non-motorized means of transportation, and are usually free, or almost free, of charge for the users. Depending on their location, bike stations have specific patterns regarding when they are empty or full. For instance, in cities where most jobs are located near the city centre, the commuters cause certain peaks in the morning: the central bike stations are filled, while the stations in the outskirts are emptied. Furthermore, stations located on top of a hill are more likely to be empty, since users are less keen on cycling uphill to return the bike, and often leave their bike at a more reachable station. These issues result in substantial user dissatisfaction which may eventually cause the users to abandon the service. This is why nowadays most bike sharing system providers take measures to rebalance them. Over the last few years, balancing bike sharing systems (BBSS) has become increasingly studied in optimization. As such, generating meaningful instance to serve as a benchmark for the proposed approaches is an important task. In this technical report we describe the procedure we used to generate BBSS problem instances from data of the CitiBike NYC bike sharing system.",0
"This paper examines methods of decision making that are able to accommodate limitations on both the form in which uncertainty pertaining to a decision problem can be realistically represented and the amount of computing time available before a decision must be made.

"Despite the recent success of deep-learning based semantic segmentation, deploying a pre-trained road scene segmenter to a city whose images are not presented in the training set would not achieve satisfactory performance due to dataset biases. Instead of collecting a large number of annotated images of each city of interest to train or refine the segmenter, we propose an unsupervised learning approach to adapt road scene segmenters across different cities. By utilizing Google Street View and its time-machine feature, we can collect unannotated images for each road scene at different times, so that the associated static-object priors can be extracted accordingly. By advancing a joint global and class-specific domain adversarial learning framework, adaptation of pre-trained segmenters to that city can be achieved without the need of any user annotation or interaction. We show that our method improves the performance of semantic segmentation in multiple cities across continents, while it performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches requiring annotated training data.",0
"Is knowledge definable as justified true belief (""JTB"")? We argue that one can legitimately answer positively or negatively, depending on how the notion of justification is understood. To facilitate our argument, we introduce a simple propositional logic of reason-based belief. We show that this logic is sufficiently flexible to accommodate various useful features, including quantification over reasons. We use our framework to contrast two notions of JTB: one internalist, the other externalist. We argue that Gettier cases essentially challenge the internalist notion but not the externalist one. In particular, we may equate knowledge and JTB if the latter is grounded in what we call ""adequate"" reasons.",0

"In this paper, we present a robotic prediction agent including a darkforest Go engine, a fuzzy markup language (FML) assessment engine, an FML-based decision support engine, and a robot engine for game of Go application. The knowledge base and rule base of FML assessment engine are constructed by referring the information from the darkforest Go engine located in NUTN and OPU, for example, the number of MCTS simulations and winning rate prediction. The proposed robotic prediction agent first retrieves the database of Go competition website, and then the FML assessment engine infers the winning possibility based on the information generated by darkforest Go engine. The FML-based decision support engine computes the winning possibility based on the partial game situation inferred by FML assessment engine. Finally, the robot engine combines with the human-friendly robot partner PALRO, produced by Fujisoft incorporated, to report the game situation to human Go players. Experimental results show that the FML-based prediction agent can work effectively.",0
"We consider the online one-class collaborative filtering (CF) problem that consists of recommending items to users over time in an online fashion based on positive ratings only. This problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We study the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation, p_f, on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of ratings required to make `good' recommendations, and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. Both questions arise in the design of recommender systems. We introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this algorithm makes---up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user's preferences---perfect recommendations. The number of ratings required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to 1/p_f, and that for updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of p_f. As a consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of 1/p_f, which can be significant.",1
"Heckerman (1993) defined causal independence in terms of a set of temporal conditional independence statements. These statements formalized certain types of causal interaction where (1) the effect is independent of the order that causes are introduced and (2) the impact of a single cause on the effect does not depend on what other causes have previously been applied. In this paper, we introduce an equivalent a temporal characterization of causal independence based on a functional representation of the relationship between causes and the effect. In this representation, the interaction between causes and effect can be written as a nested decomposition of functions. Causal independence can be exploited by representing this decomposition in the belief network, resulting in representations that are more efficient for inference than general causal models. We present empirical results showing the benefits of a causal-independence representation for belief-network inference.",0
"Monte Carlo Tree Search techniques have generally dominated General Video Game Playing, but recent research has started looking at Evolutionary Algorithms and their potential at matching Tree Search level of play or even outperforming these methods. Online or Rolling Horizon Evolution is one of the options available to evolve sequences of actions for planning in General Video Game Playing, but no research has been done up to date that explores the capabilities of the vanilla version of this algorithm in multiple games. This study aims to critically analyse the different configurations regarding population size and individual length in a set of 20 games from the General Video Game AI corpus. Distinctions are made between deterministic and stochastic games, and the implications of using superior time budgets are studied. Results show that there is scope for the use of these techniques, which in some configurations outperform Monte Carlo Tree Search, and also suggest that further research in these methods could boost their performance.",0
"Modified policy iteration (MPI) is a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that contains the two celebrated policy and value iteration methods. Despite its generality, MPI has not been thoroughly studied, especially its approximation form which is used when the state and/or action spaces are large or infinite. In this paper, we propose three approximate MPI (AMPI) algorithms that are extensions of the well-known approximate DP algorithms: fitted-value iteration, fitted-Q iteration, and classification-based policy iteration. We provide an error propagation analysis for AMPI that unifies those for approximate policy and value iteration. We also provide a finite-sample analysis for the classification-based implementation of AMPI (CBMPI), which is more general (and somehow contains) than the analysis of the other presented AMPI algorithms. An interesting observation is that the MPI's parameter allows us to control the balance of errors (in value function approximation and in estimating the greedy policy) in the final performance of the CBMPI algorithm.",1
"The recent advances in deep neural networks have led to effective vision-based reinforcement learning methods that have been employed to obtain human-level controllers in Atari 2600 games from pixel data. Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.",0
"Nieuwenhuis, Oliveras, and Tinelli (2006) showed how to describe enhancements of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm using transition systems, instead of pseudocode. We design a similar framework for several algorithms that generate answer sets for logic programs: Smodels, Smodels-cc, Asp-Sat with Learning (Cmodels), and a newly designed and implemented algorithm Sup. This approach to describing answer set solvers makes it easier to prove their correctness, to compare them, and to design new systems.",0
"Many machine learning applications require the ability to learn from and reason about noisy multi-relational data. To address this, several effective representations have been developed that provide both a language for expressing the structural regularities of a domain, and principled support for probabilistic inference. In addition to these two aspects, however, many applications also involve a third aspect-the need to reason about similarities-which has not been directly supported in existing frameworks. This paper introduces probabilistic similarity logic (PSL), a general-purpose framework for joint reasoning about similarity in relational domains that incorporates probabilistic reasoning about similarities and relational structure in a principled way. PSL can integrate any existing domain-specific similarity measures and also supports reasoning about similarities between sets of entities. We provide efficient inference and learning techniques for PSL and demonstrate its effectiveness both in common relational tasks and in settings that require reasoning about similarity.",0
"In the Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) setting, agents try to maximise the collected rewards while interacting with their environment while using some prior knowledge that is accessed beforehand. Many BRL algorithms have already been proposed, but even though a few toy examples exist in the literature, there are still no extensive or rigorous benchmarks to compare them. The paper addresses this problem, and provides a new BRL comparison methodology along with the corresponding open source library. In this methodology, a comparison criterion that measures the performance of algorithms on large sets of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) drawn from some probability distributions is defined. In order to enable the comparison of non-anytime algorithms, our methodology also includes a detailed analysis of the computation time requirement of each algorithm. Our library is released with all source code and documentation: it includes three test problems, each of which has two different prior distributions, and seven state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Finally, our library is illustrated by comparing all the available algorithms and the results are discussed.",0
"Preferences play an important role in our everyday lives. CP-networks, or CP-nets in short, are graphical models for representing conditional qualitative preferences under ceteris paribus (""all else being equal"") assumptions. Despite their intuitive nature and rich representation, dominance testing with CP-nets is computationally complex, even when the CP-nets are restricted to binary-valued preferences. Tractable algorithms exist for binary CP-nets, but these algorithms are incomplete for multi-valued CPnets. In this paper, we identify a class of multivalued CP-nets, which we call more-or-less CPnets, that have the same computational complexity as binary CP-nets. More-or-less CP-nets exploit the monotonicity of the attribute values and use intervals to aggregate values that induce similar preferences. We then present a search control rule for dominance testing that effectively prunes the search space while preserving completeness.",0
"A logic is defined that allows to express information about statistical probabilities and about degrees of belief in specific propositions. By interpreting the two types of probabilities in one common probability space, the semantics given are well suited to model the influence of statistical information on the formation of subjective beliefs. Cross entropy minimization is a key element in these semantics, the use of which is justified by showing that the resulting logic exhibits some very reasonable properties.",0
"Solving complex problems can involve non-trivial combinations of distinct knowledge bases and problem solvers. The Algebra of Modular Systems is a knowledge representation framework that provides a method for formally specifying such systems in purely semantic terms. Formally, an expression of the algebra defines a class of structures. Many expressive formalism used in practice solve the model expansion task, where a structure is given on the input and an expansion of this structure in the defined class of structures is searched (this practice overcomes the common undecidability problem for expressive logics). In this paper, we construct a solver for the model expansion task for a complex modular systems from an expression in the algebra and black-box propagators or solvers for the primitive modules. To this end, we define a general notion of propagators equipped with an explanation mechanism, an extension of the alge- bra to propagators, and a lazy conflict-driven learning algorithm. The result is a framework for seamlessly combining solving technology from different domains to produce a solver for a combined system.",0
"Recent development in developing humanoid robot poses new challenges to human-machine interaction communication. A major challenge is to develop robots that can behave like and interact with human in the most natural way possible. This paper proposes a system to develop a robot that can receive command, and talk to people in natural language. In addition, the robot can also be ""trained"" to become an expert in sepcific areas to provide expert advice to human-beings. Most important of all, the robot can display emotions through facial expression, speech and gesture so that the interaction process will become more comprehensive and compelling.",0
"The approach described here allows to use the fuzzy Object Based Representation of imprecise and uncertain knowledge. This representation has a great practical interest due to the possibility to realize reasoning on classification with a fuzzy semantic network based system. For instance, the distinction between necessary, possible and user classes allows to take into account exceptions that may appear on fuzzy knowledge-base and facilitates integration of user's Objects in the base. This approach describes the theoretical aspects of the architecture of the whole experimental A.I. system we built in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems: the understanding of ""how it works"" and ""how to complete tasks"" from queries in quite natural languages. In our model, procedural semantic networks are used to describe the knowledge of an ""ideal"" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximative and uncertain knowledge of novice users in fuzzy semantic networks which intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from our ""ideal"" expert.",0
"A crucial problem for many results and tools about bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems is bigraph embedding. An embedding is more informative than a bigraph matching, since it keeps track of the correspondence between the various components of the redex (guest) within the agent (host). In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing embeddings based on a reduction to a constraint satisfaction problem. This algorithm, that we prove to be sound and complete, has been successfully implemented in LibBig, a library for manipulating bigraphical reactive systems. This library can be used for implementing a wide range of tools, and it can be adapted to various extensions of bigraphs.",0
"Modeling polyphonic music is a particularly challenging task because of the intricate interplay between melody and harmony. A good model should satisfy three requirements: statistical accuracy (capturing faithfully the statistics of correlations at various ranges, horizontally and vertically), flexibility (coping with arbitrary user constraints), and generalization capacity (inventing new material, while staying in the style of the training corpus). Models proposed so far fail on at least one of these requirements. We propose a statistical model of polyphonic music, based on the maximum entropy principle. This model is able to learn and reproduce pairwise statistics between neighboring note events in a given corpus. The model is also able to invent new chords and to harmonize unknown melodies. We evaluate the invention capacity of the model by assessing the amount of cited, re-discovered, and invented chords on a corpus of Bach chorales. We discuss how the model enables the user to specify and enforce user-defined constraints, which makes it useful for style-based, interactive music generation.",0
"Pharmaco-epidemiology (PE) is the study of uses and effects of drugs in well defined populations. As medico-administrative databases cover a large part of the population, they have become very interesting to carry PE studies. Such databases provide longitudinal care pathways in real condition containing timestamped care events, especially drug deliveries. Temporal pattern mining becomes a strategic choice to gain valuable insights about drug uses. In this paper we propose DCM, a new discriminant temporal pattern mining algorithm. It extracts chronicle patterns that occur more in a studied population than in a control population. We present results on the identification of possible associations between hospitalizations for seizure and anti-epileptic drug switches in care pathway of epileptic patients.",0
"Minimum vertex cover problem is an NP-Hard problem with the aim of finding minimum number of vertices to cover graph. In this paper, a learning automaton based algorithm is proposed to find minimum vertex cover in graph. In the proposed algorithm, each vertex of graph is equipped with a learning automaton that has two actions in the candidate or non-candidate of the corresponding vertex cover set. Due to characteristics of learning automata, this algorithm significantly reduces the number of covering vertices of graph. The proposed algorithm based on learning automata iteratively minimize the candidate vertex cover through the update its action probability. As the proposed algorithm proceeds, a candidate solution nears to optimal solution of the minimum vertex cover problem. In order to evaluate the proposed algorithm, several experiments conducted on DIMACS dataset which compared to conventional methods. Experimental results show the major superiority of the proposed algorithm over the other methods.",0
"Markov chain model is widely applied in many fields, especially the field of prediction. The classical Discrete-time Markov chain(DTMC) is a widely used method for prediction. However, the classical DTMC model has some limitation when the system is complex with uncertain information or state space is not discrete. To address it, a new belief Markov chain model is proposed by combining Dempster-Shafer evidence theory with Markov chain. In our model, the uncertain data is allowed to be handle in the form of interval number and the basic probability assignment(BPA) is generated based on the distance between interval numbers. The new belief Markov chain model overcomes the shortcomings of classical Markov chain and has an efficient ability in dealing with uncertain information. Moreover, an example of inventory prediction and the comparison between our model and classical DTMC model can show the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed model.",0
"Though a belief network (a representation of the joint probability distribution, see [3]) and a causal network (a representation of causal relationships [14]) are intended to mean different things, they are closely related. Both assume an underlying dag (directed acyclic graph) structure of relations among variables and if Markov condition and faithfulness condition [15] are met, then a causal network is in fact a belief network. The difference comes to appearance when we recover belief network and causal network structure from data.",0
"Automatic narration of events and entities is the need of the hour, especially when live reporting is critical and volume of information to be narrated is huge. This paper discusses the challenges in this context, along with the algorithms used to build such systems. From a systematic study, we can infer that most of the work done in this area is related to statistical data. It was also found that subjective evaluation or contribution of experts is also limited for narration context.",0
"We propose a simulated annealing algorithm specifically tailored to optimise total retrieval times in a multi-level warehouse under complex pre-batched picking constraints. Experiments on real data from a picker-to-parts order picking process in the warehouse of a European manufacturer show that optimal storage assignments do not necessarily display features presumed in heuristics, such as clustering of positively correlated items or ordering of items by picking frequency.",0
"The research was proposed to exploit and extend the relational and contextual nature of the information assets of the Catasto Gregoriano, kept at the Archivio di Stato in Rome. Developed within the MODEUS project (Making Open Data Effectively Usable), this study originates from the following key ideas of MODEUS: to require Open Data to be expressed in terms of an ontology, and to include such an ontology as a documentation of the data themselves. Thus, Open Data are naturally linked by means of the ontology, which meets the requirements of the Linked Open Data vision.",0
"We develop a general duality between neural networks and compositional kernels, striving towards a better understanding of deep learning. We show that initial representations generated by common random initializations are sufficiently rich to express all functions in the dual kernel space. Hence, though the training objective is hard to optimize in the worst case, the initial weights form a good starting point for optimization. Our dual view also reveals a pragmatic and aesthetic perspective of neural networks and underscores their expressive power.",1
"This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.",0
"In this paper, we tackle the problem of extracting frequent opinions from uncertain databases. We introduce the foundation of an opinion mining approach with the definition of pattern and support measure. The support measure is derived from the commitment definition. A new algorithm called OpMiner that extracts the set of frequent opinions modelled as a mass functions is detailed. Finally, we apply our approach on a real-world biomedical database that stores opinions of experts to evaluate the reliability level of biomedical data. Performance analysis showed a better quality patterns for our proposed model in comparison with literature-based methods.",0
"In the area of computer science focusing on creating machines that can engage on behaviors that humans consider intelligent. The ability to create intelligent machines has intrigued humans since ancient times and today with the advent of the computer and 50 years of research into various programming techniques, the dream of smart machines is becoming a reality. Researchers are creating systems which can mimic human thought, understand speech, beat the best human chessplayer, and countless other feats never before possible. Ability of the human to estimate the information is most brightly shown in using of natural languages. Using words of a natural language for valuation qualitative attributes, for example, the person pawns uncertainty in form of vagueness in itself estimations. Vague sets, vague judgments, vague conclusions takes place there and then, where and when the reasonable subject exists and also is interested in something. The vague sets theory has arisen as the answer to an illegibility of language the reasonable subject speaks. Language of a reasonable subject is generated by vague events which are created by the reason and which are operated by the mind. The theory of vague sets represents an attempt to find such approximation of vague grouping which would be more convenient, than the classical theory of sets in situations where the natural language plays a significant role. Such theory has been offered by known American mathematician Gau and Buehrer .In our paper we are describing how vagueness of linguistic variables can be solved by using the vague set theory.This paper is mainly designed for one of directions of the eventology (the theory of the random vague events), which has arisen within the limits of the probability theory and which pursue the unique purpose to describe eventologically a movement of reason.",0
"We describe a variational approximation method for efficient inference in large-scale probabilistic models. Variational methods are deterministic procedures that provide approximations to marginal and conditional probabilities of interest. They provide alternatives to approximate inference methods based on stochastic sampling or search. We describe a variational approach to the problem of diagnostic inference in the `Quick Medical Reference' (QMR) network. The QMR network is a large-scale probabilistic graphical model built on statistical and expert knowledge. Exact probabilistic inference is infeasible in this model for all but a small set of cases. We evaluate our variational inference algorithm on a large set of diagnostic test cases, comparing the algorithm to a state-of-the-art stochastic sampling method.",0
"Agents of general intelligence deployed in real-world scenarios must adapt to ever-changing environmental conditions. While such adaptive agents may leverage engineered knowledge, they will require the capacity to construct and evaluate knowledge themselves from their own experience in a bottom-up, constructivist fashion. This position paper builds on the idea of encoding knowledge as temporally extended predictions through the use of general value functions. Prior work has focused on learning predictions about externally derived signals about a task or environment (e.g. battery level, joint position). Here we advocate that the agent should also predict internally generated signals regarding its own learning process - for example, an agent's confidence in its learned predictions. Finally, we suggest how such information would be beneficial in creating an introspective agent that is able to learn to make good decisions in a complex, changing world.",0
"Analyzing Big Data can help corporations to im-prove their efficiency.

We also proposea Semantic HMC process, using scalable Machine-Learning techniques and Rule-based reasoning.",0
"Reason and inference require process as well as memory skills by humans. Neural networks are able to process tasks like image recognition (better than humans) but in memory aspects are still limited (by attention mechanism, size). Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it's modified version LSTM are able to solve small memory contexts, but as context becomes larger than a threshold, it is difficult to use them. The Solution is to use large external memory. Still, it poses many challenges like, how to train neural networks for discrete memory representation, how to describe long term dependencies in sequential data etc. Most prominent neural architectures for such tasks are Memory networks: inference components combined with long term memory and Neural Turing Machines: neural networks using external memory resources. Also, additional techniques like attention mechanism, end to end gradient descent on discrete memory representation are needed to support these solutions. Preliminary results of above neural architectures on simple algorithms (sorting, copying) and Question Answering (based on story, dialogs) application are comparable with the state of the art. In this paper, I explain these architectures (in general), the additional techniques used and the results of their application.",0
"We present an n-ary constraint for the stable marriage problem. This constraint acts between two sets of integer variables where the domains of those variables represent preferences. Our constraint enforces stability and disallows bigamy. For a stable marriage instance with $n$ men and $n$ women we require only one of these constraints, and the complexity of enforcing arc-consistency is $O(n^2)$ which is optimal in the size of input. Our computational studies show that our n-ary constraint is significantly faster and more space efficient than the encodings presented in \cite{cp01}. We also introduce a new problem to the constraint community, the sex-equal stable marriage problem.",0
"In this paper we present an Action Language-Answer Set Programming based approach to solving planning and scheduling problems in hybrid domains - domains that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. We use action language H to represent the domain and then translate the resulting theory into an A-Prolog program. In this way, we reduce the problem of finding solutions to planning and scheduling problems to computing answer sets of A-Prolog programs. We cite a planning and scheduling example from the literature and show how to model it in H. We show how to translate the resulting H theory into an equivalent A-Prolog program. We compute the answer sets of the resulting program using a hybrid solver called EZCSP which loosely integrates a constraint solver with an answer set solver. The solver allows us reason about constraints over reals and compute solutions to complex planning and scheduling problems. Results have shown that our approach can be applied to any planning and scheduling problem in hybrid domains.",0
"One major deficiency of most semantic representation techniques is that they usually model a word type as a single point in the semantic space, hence conflating all the meanings that the word can have. Addressing this issue by learning distinct representations for individual meanings of words has been the subject of several research studies in the past few years. However, the generated sense representations are either not linked to any sense inventory or are unreliable for infrequent word senses. We propose a technique that tackles these problems by de-conflating the representations of words based on the deep knowledge it derives from a semantic network. Our approach provides multiple advantages in comparison to the past work, including its high coverage and the ability to generate accurate representations even for infrequent word senses. We carry out evaluations on six datasets across two semantic similarity tasks and report state-of-the-art results on most of them.",1
"Directed possibly cyclic graphs have been proposed by Didelez (2000) and Nodelmann et al. (2002) in order to represent the dynamic dependencies among stochastic processes. These dependencies are based on a generalization of Granger-causality to continuous time, first developed by Schweder (1970) for Markov processes, who called them local dependencies. They deserve special attention as they are asymmetric unlike stochastic (in)dependence. In this paper we focus on their graphical representation and develop a suitable, i.e. asymmetric notion of separation, called delta-separation. The properties of this graph separation as well as of local independence are investigated in detail within a framework of asymmetric (semi)graphoids allowing a deeper insight into what information can be read off these graphs.",0
"When combined properly, search techniques can reveal the full potential of sophisticated branching heuristics. We demonstrate this observation on the well-known class of random 3-SAT formulae. First, a new branching heuristic is presented, which generalizes existing work on this class. Much smaller search trees can be constructed by using this heuristic. Second, we introduce a variant of discrepancy search, called ALDS. Theoretical and practical evidence support that ALDS traverses the search tree in a near-optimal order when combined with the new heuristic. Both techniques, search and heuristic, have been implemented in the look-ahead solver march. The SAT 2009 competition results show that march is by far the strongest complete solver on random k-SAT formulae.",0
"A common strategy for improving optimization algorithms is to restart the algorithm when it is believed to be trapped in an inferior part of the search space. However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for specific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not regarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm. In fact, many optimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all.",0
"A broad range of on-line behaviors are mediated by interfaces in which people make choices among sets of options. A rich and growing line of work in the behavioral sciences indicate that human choices follow not only from the utility of alternatives, but also from the choice set in which alternatives are presented. In this work we study comparison-based choice functions, a simple but surprisingly rich class of functions capable of exhibiting so-called choice-set effects. Motivated by the challenge of predicting complex choices, we study the query complexity of these functions in a variety of settings. We consider settings that allow for active queries or passive observation of a stream of queries, and give analyses both at the granularity of individuals or populations that might exhibit heterogeneous choice behavior. Our main result is that any comparison-based choice function in one dimension can be inferred as efficiently as a basic maximum or minimum choice function across many query contexts, suggesting that choice-set effects need not entail any fundamental algorithmic barriers to inference. We also introduce a class of choice functions we call distance-comparison-based functions, and briefly discuss the analysis of such functions. The framework we outline provides intriguing connections between human choice behavior and a range of questions in the theory of sorting.",0
"Performance prediction or forecasting sporting outcomes involves a great deal of insight into the particular area one is dealing with, and a considerable amount of intuition about the factors that bear on such outcomes and performances. The mathematical Theory of Evidence offers representation formalisms which grant experts a high degree of freedom when expressing their subjective beliefs in the context of decision-making situations like performance prediction. Furthermore, this reasoning framework incorporates a powerful mechanism to systematically pool the decisions made by individual subject matter experts. The idea behind such a combination of knowledge is to improve the competence (quality) of the overall decision-making process. This paper reports on a performance prediction experiment carried out during the European Football Championship in 1996. Relying on the knowledge of four predictors, Evidence Theory was used to forecast the final scores of all 31 matches. The results of this empirical study are very encouraging.",0
"This work describes a methodology to combine logic-based systems and connectionist systems. Our approach uses finite truth valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic, where we take advantage of fact what in this type of logics every connective can be define by a neuron in an artificial network having by activation function the identity truncated to zero and one. This allowed the injection of first-order formulas in a network architecture, and also simplified symbolic rule extraction.",0
"This paper describes a decision theoretic formulation of learning the graphical structure of a Bayesian Belief Network from data. This framework subsumes the standard Bayesian approach of choosing the model with the largest posterior probability as the solution of a decision problem with a 0-1 loss function and allows the use of more general loss functions able to trade-off the complexity of the selected model and the error of choosing an oversimplified model. A new class of loss functions, called disintegrable, is introduced, to allow the decision problem to match the decomposability of the graphical model. With this class of loss functions, the optimal solution to the decision problem can be found using an efficient bottom-up search strategy.",0
"Probabilistic programming languages and modeling toolkits are two modular ways to build and reuse stochastic models and inference procedures. Combining strengths of both, we express models and inference as generalized coroutines in the same general-purpose language. We use existing facilities of the language, such as rich libraries, optimizing compilers, and types, to develop concise, declarative, and realistic models with competitive performance on exact and approximate inference. In particular, a wide range of models can be expressed using memoization. Because deterministic parts of models run at full speed, custom inference procedures are trivial to incorporate, and inference procedures can reason about themselves without interpretive overhead. Within this framework, we introduce a new, general algorithm for importance sampling with look-ahead.",0
"Analogy Based Effort Estimation (ABE) is one of the prominent methods for software effort estimation. The fundamental concept of ABE is closer to the mentality of expert estimation but with an automated procedure in which the final estimate is generated by reusing similar historical projects. The main key issue when using ABE is how to adapt the effort of the retrieved nearest neighbors. The adaptation process is an essential part of ABE to generate more successful accurate estimation based on tuning the selected raw solutions, using some adaptation strategy. In this study we show that there are three interrelated decision variables that have great impact on the success of adaptation method: (1) number of nearest analogies (k), (2) optimum feature set needed for adaptation, and (3) adaptation weights. To find the right decision regarding these variables, one need to study all possible combinations and evaluate them individually to select the one that can improve all prediction evaluation measures. The existing evaluation measures usually behave differently, presenting sometimes opposite trends in evaluating prediction methods. This means that changing one decision variable could improve one evaluation measure while it is decreasing the others. Therefore, the main theme of this research is how to come up with best decision variables that improve adaptation strategy and thus, the overall evaluation measures without degrading the others. The impact of these decisions together has not been investigated before, therefore we propose to view the building of adaptation procedure as a multi-objective optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) is utilized to find the optimum solutions for such decision variables based on optimizing multiple evaluation measures",0
"Coins are frequently used in everyday life at various places like in banks, grocery stores, supermarkets, automated weighing machines, vending machines etc. So, there is a basic need to automate the counting and sorting of coins. For this machines need to recognize the coins very fast and accurately, as further transaction processing depends on this recognition. Three types of systems are available in the market: Mechanical method based systems, Electromagnetic method based systems and Image processing based systems. This paper presents an overview of available systems and techniques based on image processing to recognize ancient and modern coins.",0
"The understanding of the buildings operation has become a challenging task due to the large amount of data recorded in energy efficient buildings. Still, today the experts use visual tools for analyzing the data. In order to make the task realistic, a method has been proposed in this paper to automatically detect the different patterns in buildings. The K Means clustering is used to automatically identify the ON (operational) cycles of the chiller. In the next step the ON cycles are transformed to symbolic representation by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) method. Then the SAX symbols are converted to bag of words representation for hierarchical clustering. Moreover, the proposed technique is applied to real life data of adsorption chiller. Additionally, the results from the proposed method and dynamic time warping (DTW) approach are also discussed and compared.",0
Our aim is to extract information about literary characters in unstructured texts. We employ natural language processing and reasoning on domain ontologies. The first task is to identify the main characters and the parts of the story where these characters are described or act. We illustrate the system in a scenario in the folktale domain. The system relies on a folktale ontology that we have developed based on Propp's model for folktales morphology.,0
"This paper discuses multiple Bayesian networks representation paradigms for encoding asymmetric independence assertions.

"This article aims to achieve two goals: to show that probability is not the only way of dealing with uncertainty (and even more, that there are kinds of uncertainty which are for principled reasons not addressable with probabilistic means); and to provide evidence that logic-based methods can well support reasoning with uncertainty. For the latter claim, two paradigmatic examples are presented: Logic Programming with Kleene semantics for modelling reasoning from information in a discourse, to an interpretation of the state of affairs of the intended model, and a neural-symbolic implementation of Input/Output logic for dealing with uncertainty in dynamic normative contexts.",0
"Non-negative matrix factorization models based on a hierarchical Gamma-Poisson structure capture user and item behavior effectively in extremely sparse data sets, making them the ideal choice for collaborative filtering applications. Hierarchical Poisson factorization (HPF) in particular has proved successful for scalable recommendation systems with extreme sparsity. HPF, however, suffers from a tight coupling of sparsity model (absence of a rating) and response model (the value of the rating), which limits the expressiveness of the latter. Here, we introduce hierarchical compound Poisson factorization (HCPF) that has the favorable Gamma-Poisson structure and scalability of HPF to high-dimensional extremely sparse matrices. More importantly, HCPF decouples the sparsity model from the response model, allowing us to choose the most suitable distribution for the response. HCPF can capture binary, non-negative discrete, non-negative continuous, and zero-inflated continuous responses. We compare HCPF with HPF on nine discrete and three continuous data sets and conclude that HCPF captures the relationship between sparsity and response better than HPF.",1

"This provocation paper provides an overview of the underlying optimisation problem in the emerging field of Digital Manufacturing. Initially, this paper discusses how the notion of Digital Manufacturing is transforming from a term describing a suite of software tools for the integration of production and design functions towards a more general concept incorporating computerised manufacturing and supply chain processes, as well as information collection and utilisation across the product life cycle. On this basis, we use the example of one such manufacturing process, Additive Manufacturing, to identify an integrated multi-objective optimisation problem underlying Digital Manufacturing. Forming an opportunity for a concurrent application of data science and optimisation, a set of challenges arising from this problem is outlined.",0
"Coverings are common forms of data representation, and covering-based rough sets serve as an efficient technique to process this type of data in data mining. There are many optimization issues in data mining such as attribute reductions. Geometric lattices have been widely used in many fields, especially greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reductions. Therefore, it is meaningful to connect coverings with geometric lattices to solve these optimization problems. In this paper, we obtain geometric lattices from coverings through matroids and then apply them to attribute reductions. First, a geometric lattice structure of a covering is constructed through transversal matroids. Then its characteristics, such as atoms and coatoms, are studied and used to describe the lattice. Second, considering that a geometric lattice is the lattice of all the closed sets of a finite matroid, we propose one dependence space through matroids and study the attribute reduction issues of the space, which realizes the application of geometric lattices to attribute reductions. Furthermore, a special type of information system is taken as an example to illustrate the application. In a word, this work points out an interesting view, namely, geometric lattice, to study the attribute reduction issues of information systems.",0
This paper proposes a path planning strategy for an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) navigating in a partially known environment. Global path planning is performed by first using a spatial database of the region to be traversed containing selected attributes such as height data and soil information from a suitable spatial database. The database is processed using a biomimetic swarm algorithm that is inspired by the nest building strategies followed by termites. Local path planning is performed online utilizing information regarding contingencies that affect the safe navigation of the AGV from various sensors. The simulation discussed has been implemented on the open source Player-Stage-Gazebo platform.,0
"Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree,discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions.Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods,appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment.",0
"The paper is a second in a series of two papers evaluating the power of a new scheme that generates search heuristics mechanically. The heuristics are extracted from an approximation scheme called mini-bucket elimination that was recently introduced. The first paper introduced the idea and evaluated it within Branch-and-Bound search. In the current paper the idea is further extended and evaluated within Best-First search. The resulting algorithms are compared on coding and medical diagnosis problems, using varying strength of the mini-bucket heuristics.",0
"An important use of machine learning is to learn what people value. What posts or photos should a user be shown? Which jobs or activities would a person find rewarding? In each case, observations of people's past choices can inform our inferences about their likes and preferences. If we assume that choices are approximately optimal according to some utility function, we can treat preference inference as Bayesian inverse planning. That is, given a prior on utility functions and some observed choices, we invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility functions. However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false beliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally inconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by constructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false beliefs and time inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models make about preferences, beliefs, and biases. We present a behavioral experiment in which human subjects perform preference inference given the same observations of choices as our model. Results show that human subjects (like our model) explain choices in terms of systematic deviations from optimal behavior and suggest that they take such deviations into account when inferring preferences.",1
"Student dropout prediction is an indispensable for numerous intelligent systems to measure the education system and success rate of any university as well as throughout the university in the world. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop efficient methods for prediction of the students at risk of dropping out, enabling the adoption of proactive process to minimize the situation. Thus, this research work propose a prototype machine learning tool which can automatically recognize whether the student will continue their study or drop their study using classification technique based on decision tree and extract hidden information from large data about what factors are responsible for dropout student. Further the contribution of factors responsible for dropout risk was studied using discriminant analysis and to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among significant datasets, Association rule mining was applied.

"We propose a low cost and effective way to combine a free simulation software and free CAD models for modeling human-object interaction in order to improve human &amp; object segmentation. It is intended for research scenarios related to safe human-robot collaboration (SHRC) and interaction (SHRI) in the industrial domain. The task of human and object modeling has been used for detecting activity, and for inferring and predicting actions, different from those works, we do human and object modeling in order to learn interactions in RGB-D data for improving segmentation. For this purpose, we define a novel density function to model a three dimensional (3D) scene in a virtual environment (VREP). This density function takes into account various possible configurations of human-object and object-object relationships and interactions governed by their affordances. Using this function, we synthesize a large, realistic and highly varied synthetic RGB-D dataset that we use for training. We train a random forest classifier, and the pixelwise predictions obtained is integrated as a unary term in a pairwise conditional random fields (CRF). Our evaluation shows that modeling these interactions improves segmentation performance by ~7\% in mean average precision and recall over state-of-the-art methods that ignore these interactions in real-world data. Our approach is computationally efficient, robust and can run real-time on consumer hardware.",0
"Current evaluation functions for heuristic planning are expensive to compute. In numerous planning problems these functions provide good guidance to the solution, so they are worth the expense. However, when evaluation functions are misguiding or when planning problems are large enough, lots of node evaluations must be computed, which severely limits the scalability of heuristic planners. In this paper, we present a novel solution for reducing node evaluations in heuristic planning based on machine learning. Particularly, we define the task of learning search control for heuristic planning as a relational classification task, and we use an off-the-shelf relational classification tool to address this learning task. Our relational classification task captures the preferred action to select in the different planning contexts of a specific planning domain. These planning contexts are defined by the set of helpful actions of the current state, the goals remaining to be achieved, and the static predicates of the planning task. This paper shows two methods for guiding the search of a heuristic planner with the learned classifiers. The first one consists of using the resulting classifier as an action policy. The second one consists of applying the classifier to generate lookahead states within a Best First Search algorithm. Experiments over a variety of domains reveal that our heuristic planner using the learned classifiers solves larger problems than state-of-the-art planners.",0
"Conditional independence and Markov properties are powerful tools allowing expression of multidimensional probability distributions by means of low-dimensional ones. As multidimensional possibilistic models have been studied for several years, the demand for analogous tools in possibility theory seems to be quite natural. This paper is intended to be a promotion of de Cooman's measure-theoretic approcah to possibility theory, as this approach allows us to find analogies to many important results obtained in probabilistic framework. First, we recall semi-graphoid properties of conditional possibilistic independence, parameterized by a continuous t-norm, and find sufficient conditions for a class of Archimedean t-norms to have the graphoid property. Then we introduce Markov properties and factorization of possibility distrubtions (again parameterized by a continuous t-norm) and find the relationships between them. These results are accompanied by a number of conterexamples, which show that the assumptions of specific theorems are substantial.",0
"One important factor determining the computational complexity of evaluating a probabilistic network is the cardinality of the state spaces of the nodes. By varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in the result for computational efficiency. We present an anytime procedure for approximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. On application to some simple networks, the procedure exhibits a smooth improvement in approximation quality as computation time increases. This suggests that state-space abstraction is one more useful control parameter for designing real-time probabilistic reasoners.",0
"We motivate and describe a theory of belief in this paper. This theory is developed with the following view of human belief in mind. Consider the belief that an event E will occur (or has occurred or is occurring). An agent either entertains this belief or does not entertain this belief (i.e., there is no ""grade"" in entertaining the belief). If the agent chooses to exercise ""the will to believe"" and entertain this belief, he/she/it is entitled to a degree of confidence c (1 &gt; c &gt; 0) in doing so. Adopting this view of human belief, we conjecture that whenever an agent entertains the belief that E will occur with c degree of confidence, the agent will be surprised (to the extent c) upon realizing that E did not occur.",0
"We study the extent to which we can infer users' geographical locations from social media. Location inference from social media can benefit many applications, such as disaster management, targeted advertising, and news content tailoring. In recent years, a number of algorithms have been proposed for identifying user locations on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook from message contents, friend networks, and interactions between users. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model based on factor graphs for location inference that offers several unique advantages for this task. First, the model generalizes previous methods by incorporating content, network, and deep features learned from social context. The model is also flexible enough to support both supervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Second, we explore several learning algorithms for the proposed model, and present a Two-chain Metropolis-Hastings (MH+) algorithm, which improves the inference accuracy. Third, we validate the proposed model on three different genres of data - Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook - and demonstrate that the proposed model can substantially improve the inference accuracy (+3.3-18.5% by F1-score) over that of several state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Pseudo-Boolean constraints are omnipresent in practical applications, and thus a significant effort has been devoted to the development of good SAT encoding techniques for them. Some of these encodings first construct a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) for the constraint, and then encode the BDD into a propositional formula. These BDD-based approaches have some important advantages, such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients, or being able to share the same BDD for representing many constraints.",0
"The paper deals with optimality issues in connection with updating beliefs in networks. We address two processes: triangulation and construction of junction trees. In the first part, we give a simple algorithm for constructing an optimal junction tree from a triangulated network. In the second part, we argue that any exact method based on local calculations must either be less efficient than the junction tree method, or it has an optimality problem equivalent to that of triangulation.",0
This report describes our participation in the cDiscount 2015 challenge where the goal was to classify product items in a predefined taxonomy of products. Our best submission yielded an accuracy score of 64.20\% in the private part of the leaderboard and we were ranked 10th out of 175 participating teams. We followed a text classification approach employing mainly linear models. The final solution was a weighted voting system which combined a variety of trained models.,0
"We present a system that produces sentential descriptions of video: who did what to whom, and where and how they did it. Action class is rendered as a verb, participant objects as noun phrases, properties of those objects as adjectival modifiers in those noun phrases,spatial relations between those participants as prepositional phrases, and characteristics of the event as prepositional-phrase adjuncts and adverbial modifiers. Extracting the information needed to render these linguistic entities requires an approach to event recognition that recovers object tracks, the track-to-role assignments, and changing body posture.",0

"Analysis of sequential event data has been recognized as one of the essential tools in data modeling and analysis field. In this paper, after the examination of its technical requirements and issues to model complex but practical situation, we propose a new sequential data model, dubbed Duration and Interval Hidden Markov Model (DI-HMM), that efficiently represents ""state duration"" and ""state interval"" of data events. This has significant implications to play an important role in representing practical time-series sequential data. This eventually provides an efficient and flexible sequential data retrieval. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed DI-HMM.",0
"Many researchers in artificial intelligence are beginning to explore the use of soft constraints to express a set of (possibly conflicting) problem requirements. A soft constraint is a function defined on a collection of variables which associates some measure of desirability with each possible combination of values for those variables. However, the crucial question of the computational complexity of finding the optimal solution to a collection of soft constraints has so far received very little attention. In this paper we identify a class of soft binary constraints for which the problem of finding the optimal solution is tractable. In other words, we show that for any given set of such constraints, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to determine the assignment having the best overall combined measure of desirability. This tractable class includes many commonly-occurring soft constraints, such as 'as near as possible' or 'as soon as possible after', as well as crisp constraints such as 'greater than'. Finally, we show that this tractable class is maximal, in the sense that adding any other form of soft binary constraint which is not in the class gives rise to a class of problems which is NP-hard.",0
"We consider the problem of rational uncertainty about unproven mathematical statements, which G\""odel and others have remarked on. Using Bayesian-inspired arguments we build a normative model of fair bets under deductive uncertainty which diverges from probability theory per se but draws on the theory of algorithms. We comment on connections to Zeilberger's notion of ""semi-rigorous proofs"", particularly that inherent subjectivity is an obstacle.",0
"Hierarchical latent class (HLC) models are tree-structured Bayesian networks where leaf nodes are observed while internal nodes are latent. There are no theoretically well justified model selection criteria for HLC models in particular and Bayesian networks with latent nodes in general. Nonetheless, empirical studies suggest that the BIC score is a reasonable criterion to use in practice for learning HLC models. Empirical studies also suggest that sometimes model selection can be improved if standard model dimension is replaced with effective model dimension in the penalty term of the BIC score. Effective dimensions are difficult to compute. In this paper, we prove a theorem that relates the effective dimension of an HLC model to the effective dimensions of a number of latent class models. The theorem makes it computationally feasible to compute the effective dimensions of large HLC models. The theorem can also be used to compute the effective dimensions of general tree models.",0
"Decision making is still an open issue in the application of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. A lot of works have been presented for it. In the transferable belief model (TBM), pignistic probabilities based on the basic probability as- signments are used for decision making. In this paper, multiscale probability transformation of basic probability assignment based on the belief function and the plausibility function is proposed, which is a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation. In the multiscale probability function, a factor q based on the Tsallis entropy is used to make the multiscale prob- abilities diversified. An example is shown that the multiscale probability transformation is more reasonable in the decision making.",0
"This paper concerns the single machine total weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setup times, usually referred as $1|s_{ij}|\sum w_jT_j$. In this $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem, each job has an associated processing time, due date and a weight. For each pair of jobs $i$ and $j$, there may be a setup time before starting to process $j$ in case this job is scheduled immediately after $i$. The objective is to determine a schedule that minimizes the total weighted tardiness, where the tardiness of a job is equal to its completion time minus its due date, in case the job is completely processed only after its due date, and is equal to zero otherwise. Due to its complexity, this problem is most commonly solved by heuristics. The aim of this work is to develop a simple yet effective limitation strategy that speeds up the local search procedure without a significant loss in the solution quality. Such strategy consists of a filtering mechanism that prevents unpromising moves to be evaluated. The proposed strategy has been embedded in a local search based metaheuristic from the literature and tested in classical benchmark instances. Computational experiments revealed that the limitation strategy enabled the metaheuristic to be extremely competitive when compared to other algorithms from the literature, since it allowed the use of a large number of neighborhood structures without a significant increase in the CPU time and, consequently, high quality solutions could be achieved in a matter of seconds.",0
"We have designed a machine that becomes increasingly better at behaving in underspecified circumstances, in a goal-directed way, on the job, by modeling itself and its environment as experience accumulates. Based on principles of autocatalysis, endogeny, and reflectivity, the work provides an architectural blueprint for constructing systems with high levels of operational autonomy in underspecified circumstances, starting from a small seed. Through value-driven dynamic priority scheduling controlling the parallel execution of a vast number of reasoning threads, the system achieves recursive self-improvement after it leaves the lab, within the boundaries imposed by its designers. A prototype system has been implemented and demonstrated to learn a complex real-world task, real-time multimodal dialogue with humans, by on-line observation. Our work presents solutions to several challenges that must be solved for achieving artificial general intelligence.",0
"Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are typically solved by finding an approximate global solution to a corresponding belief-MDP. In this paper, we offer a new planning algorithm for POMDPs with continuous state, action and observation spaces. Since such domains have an inherent notion of locality, we can find an approximate solution using local optimization methods. We parameterize the belief distribution as a Gaussian mixture, and use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to approximate the belief update. Since the EKF is a first-order filter, we can marginalize over the observations analytically. By using feedback control and state estimation during policy execution, we recover a behavior that is effectively conditioned on incoming observations despite the unconditioned planning. Local optimization provides no guarantees of global optimality, but it allows us to tackle domains that are at least an order of magnitude larger than the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm by considering a simulated hand-eye coordination domain with 16 continuous state dimensions and 6 continuous action dimensions.",0
"Online services such as web search and e-commerce applications typically rely on the collection of data about users, including details of their activities on the web. Such personal data is used to enhance the quality of service via personalization of content and to maximize revenues via better targeting of advertisements and deeper engagement of users on sites. To date, service providers have largely followed the approach of either requiring or requesting consent for opting-in to share their data. Users may be willing to share private information in return for better quality of service or for incentives, or in return for assurances about the nature and extend of the logging of data. We introduce \emph{stochastic privacy}, a new approach to privacy centering on a simple concept: A guarantee is provided to users about the upper-bound on the probability that their personal data will be used. Such a probability, which we refer to as \emph{privacy risk}, can be assessed by users as a preference or communicated as a policy by a service provider. Service providers can work to personalize and to optimize revenues in accordance with preferences about privacy risk. We present procedures, proofs, and an overall system for maximizing the quality of services, while respecting bounds on allowable or communicated privacy risk. We demonstrate the methodology with a case study and evaluation of the procedures applied to web search personalization. We show how we can achieve near-optimal utility of accessing information with provable guarantees on the probability of sharing data.",1

"Or's of And's (OA) models are comprised of a small number of disjunctions of conjunctions, also called disjunctive normal form. An example of an OA model is as follows: If ($x_1 = $ `blue' AND $x_2=$ `middle') OR ($x_1 = $ `yellow'), then predict $Y=1$, else predict $Y=0$. Or's of And's models have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they are a set of conditions that concisely capture the characteristics of a specific subset of data. We present two optimization-based machine learning frameworks for constructing OA models, Optimized OA (OOA) and its faster version, Optimized OA with Approximations (OOAx). We prove theoretical bounds on the properties of patterns in an OA model. We build OA models as a diagnostic screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea, that achieves high accuracy with a substantial gain in interpretability over other methods.",0
"Summarization based on text extraction is inherently limited, but generation-style abstractive methods have proven challenging to build. In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach to abstractive sentence summarization. Our method utilizes a local attention-based model that generates each word of the summary conditioned on the input sentence. While the model is structurally simple, it can easily be trained end-to-end and scales to a large amount of training data. The model shows significant performance gains on the DUC-2004 shared task compared with several strong baselines.",1
"Compact representations of objects is a common concept in computer science. Automated planning can be viewed as a case of this concept: a planning instance is a compact implicit representation of a graph and the problem is to find a path (a plan) in this graph. While the graphs themselves are represented compactly as planning instances, the paths are usually represented explicitly as sequences of actions. Some cases are known where the plans always have compact representations, for example, using macros. We show that these results do not extend to the general case, by proving a number of bounds for compact representations of plans under various criteria, like efficient sequential or random access of actions. In addition to this, we show that our results have consequences for what can be gained from reformulating planning into some other problem. As a contrast to this we also prove a number of positive results, demonstrating restricted cases where plans do have useful compact representations, as well as proving that macro plans have favourable access properties. Our results are finally discussed in relation to other relevant contexts.",0
"Pairwise association measure is an important operation in data analytics. Kendall's tau coefficient is one widely used correlation coefficient identifying non-linear relationships between ordinal variables. In this paper, we investigated a parallel algorithm accelerating all-pairs Kendall's tau coefficient computation via single instruction multiple data (SIMD) vectorized sorting on Intel Xeon Phis by taking advantage of many processing cores and 512-bit SIMD vector instructions. To facilitate workload balancing and overcome on-chip memory limitation, we proposed a generic framework for symmetric all-pairs computation by building provable bijective functions between job identifier and coordinate space. Performance evaluation demonstrated that our algorithm on one 5110P Phi achieves two orders-of-magnitude speedups over 16-threaded MATLAB and three orders-of-magnitude speedups over sequential R, both running on high-end CPUs. Besides, our algorithm exhibited rather good distributed computing scalability with respect to number of Phis. Source code and datasets are publicly available at",0
"Probabilistic programming is related to a compositional approach to stochastic modeling by switching from discrete to continuous time dynamics. In continuous time, an operator-algebra semantics is available in which processes proceeding in parallel (and possibly interacting) have summed time-evolution operators. From this foundation, algorithms for simulation, inference and model reduction may be systematically derived. The useful consequences are potentially far-reaching in computational science, machine learning and beyond. Hybrid compositional stochastic modeling/probabilistic programming approaches may also be possible.",0
"One particular challenge in AI is the computational modelling and simulation of creativity. Feedback and learning from experience are key aspects of the creative process. Here we investigate how we could implement feedback in creative systems using a social model. From the field of creative writing we borrow the concept of a Writers Workshop as a model for learning through feedback. The Writers Workshop encourages examination, discussion and debates of a piece of creative work using a prescribed format of activities. We propose a computational model of the Writers Workshop as a roadmap for incorporation of feedback in artificial creativity systems. We argue that the Writers Workshop setting describes the anatomy of the creative process. We support our claim with a case study that describes how to implement the Writers Workshop model in a computational creativity system. We present this work using patterns other people can follow to implement similar designs in their own systems. We conclude by discussing the broader relevance of this model to other aspects of AI.",0
"Optimization is becoming a crucial element in industrial applications involving sustainable alternative energy systems. During the design of such systems, the engineer/decision maker would often encounter noise factors (e.g. solar insolation and ambient temperature fluctuations) when their system interacts with the environment. In this chapter, the sizing and design optimization of the solar powered irrigation system was considered. This problem is multivariate, noisy, nonlinear and multiobjective. This design problem was tackled by first using the Fuzzy Type II approach to model the noise factors. Consequently, the Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) (in the context of a weighted sum framework) was employed to solve this multiobjective fuzzy design problem. This method was then used to construct the approximate Pareto frontier as well as to identify the best solution option in a fuzzy setting. Comprehensive analyses and discussions were performed on the generated numerical results with respect to the implemented solution methods.",0
"Multi-agent path planning is a challenging problem with numerous real-life applications. Running a centralized search such as A* in the combined state space of all units is complete and cost-optimal, but scales poorly, as the state space size is exponential in the number of mobile units. Traditional decentralized approaches, such as FAR and WHCA*, are faster and more scalable, being based on problem decomposition. However, such methods are incomplete and provide no guarantees with respect to the running time or the solution quality. They are not necessarily able to tell in a reasonable time whether they would succeed in finding a solution to a given instance. We introduce MAPP, a tractable algorithm for multi-agent path planning on undirected graphs. We present a basic version and several extensions. They have low-polynomial worst-case upper bounds for the running time, the memory requirements, and the length of solutions. Even though all algorithmic versions are incomplete in the general case, each provides formal guarantees on problems it can solve. For each version, we discuss the algorithms completeness with respect to clearly defined subclasses of instances. Experiments were run on realistic game grid maps. MAPP solved 99.86% of all mobile units, which is 18--22% better than the percentage of FAR and WHCA*. MAPP marked 98.82% of all units as provably solvable during the first stage of plan computation. Parts of MAPPs computation can be re-used across instances on the same map. Speed-wise, MAPP is competitive or significantly faster than WHCA*, depending on whether MAPP performs all computations from scratch. When data that MAPP can re-use are preprocessed offline and readily available, MAPP is slower than the very fast FAR algorithm by a factor of 2.18 on average. MAPPs solutions are on average 20% longer than FARs solutions and 7--31% longer than WHCA*s solutions.",0
"Traditional economic models typically treat private information, or signals, as generated from some underlying state. Recent work has explicated alternative models, where signals correspond to interpretations of available information. We show that the difference between these formulations can be sharply cast in terms of causal dependence structure, and employ graphical models to illustrate the distinguishing characteristics. The graphical representation supports inferences about signal patterns in the interpreted framework, and suggests how results based on the generated model can be extended to more general situations. Specific insights about bidding games in classical auction mechanisms derive from qualitative graphical models.",0
"We describe a novel approach to monitoring high level behaviors using concepts from AI planning. Our goal is to understand what a program is doing based on its system call trace. This ability is particularly important for detecting malware. We approach this problem by building an abstract model of the operating system using the STRIPS planning language, casting system calls as planning operators. Given a system call trace, we simulate the corresponding operators on our model and by observing the properties of the state reached, we learn about the nature of the original program and its behavior. Thus, unlike most statistical detection methods that focus on syntactic features, our approach is semantic in nature. Therefore, it is more robust against obfuscation techniques used by malware that change the outward appearance of the trace but not its effect. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating it on actual system call traces.",0
"We establish a link between multiwinner elections and apportionment problems by showing how approval-based multiwinner election rules can be interpreted as methods of apportionment. We consider several multiwinner rules and observe that they induce apportionment methods that are well-established in the literature on proportional representation. For instance, we show that Proportional Approval Voting induces the D'Hondt method and that Monroe's rule induces the largest reminder method. We also consider properties of apportionment methods and exhibit multiwinner rules that induce apportionment methods satisfying these properties.",1
"The paper presents a scheme for computing lower and upper bounds on the posterior marginals in Bayesian networks with discrete variables. Its power lies in its ability to use any available scheme that bounds the probability of evidence or posterior marginals and enhance its performance in an anytime manner. The scheme uses the cutset conditioning principle to tighten existing bounding schemes and to facilitate anytime behavior, utilizing a fixed number of cutset tuples. The accuracy of the bounds improves as the number of used cutset tuples increases and so does the computation time. We demonstrate empirically the value of our scheme for bounding posterior marginals and probability of evidence using a variant of the bound propagation algorithm as a plug-in scheme.",0
"We consider the question of extending propositional logic to a logic of plausible reasoning, and posit four requirements that any such extension should satisfy. Each is a requirement that some property of classical propositional logic be preserved in the extended logic; as such, the requirements are simpler and less problematic than those used in Cox's Theorem and its variants. As with Cox's Theorem, our requirements imply that the extended logic must be isomorphic to (finite-set) probability theory. We also obtain specific numerical values for the probabilities, recovering the classical definition of probability as a theorem, with truth assignments that satisfy the premise playing the role of the ""possible cases.""",0

"Studying characters plays a vital role in computationally representing and interpreting narratives. Unlike previous work, which has focused on inferring character roles, we focus on the problem of modeling their relationships. Rather than assuming a fixed relationship for a character pair, we hypothesize that relationships are dynamic and temporally evolve with the progress of the narrative, and formulate the problem of relationship modeling as a structured prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised framework to learn relationship sequences from fully as well as partially labeled data. We present a Markovian model capable of accumulating historical beliefs about the relationship and status changes. We use a set of rich linguistic and semantically motivated features that incorporate world knowledge to investigate the textual content of narrative. We empirically demonstrate that such a framework outperforms competitive baselines.",1
"What is happiness for reinforcement learning agents? We seek a formal definition satisfying a list of desiderata. Our proposed definition of happiness is the temporal difference error, i.e. the difference between the value of the obtained reward and observation and the agent's expectation of this value. This definition satisfies most of our desiderata and is compatible with empirical research on humans. We state several implications and discuss examples.",0
"Scalable and effective exploration remains a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the setting of discrete state and action spaces, these methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional deep RL scenarios. As such, most contemporary RL relies on simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise to the controls. This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of information gain about the agent's belief of environment dynamics. We propose a practical implementation, using variational inference in Bayesian neural networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces. VIME modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different underlying RL algorithms. We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse rewards.",1
"Abstract argumentation framework (\AFname) is a unifying framework able to encompass a variety of nonmonotonic reasoning approaches, logic programming and computational argumentation. Yet, efficient approaches for most of the decision and enumeration problems associated to \AFname s are missing, thus potentially limiting the efficacy of argumentation-based approaches in real domains. In this paper, we present an algorithm for enumerating the preferred extensions of abstract argumentation frameworks which exploits parallel computation. To this purpose, the SCC-recursive semantics definition schema is adopted, where extensions are defined at the level of specific sub-frameworks. The algorithm shows significant performance improvements in large frameworks, in terms of number of solutions found and speedup.",0
"In this paper I present a new approach for regression of time series using their own samples. This is a celebrated problem known as Auto-Regression. Dealing with outlier or missed samples in a time series makes the problem of estimation difficult, so it should be robust against them. Moreover for coding purposes I will show that it is desired the residual of auto-regression be sparse. To these aims, I first assume a multivariate Gaussian prior on the residual and then obtain the estimation. Two simple simulations have been done on spectrum estimation and speech coding.",0
"This paper examines the interdependence generated between two parent nodes with a common instantiated child node, such as two hypotheses sharing common evidence. The relation so generated has been termed ""intercausal."" It is shown by construction that inter-causal independence is possible for binary distributions at one state of evidence. For such ""CICI"" distributions, the two measures of inter-causal effect, ""multiplicative synergy"" and ""additive synergy"" are equal. The well known ""noisy-or"" model is an example of such a distribution. This introduces novel semantics for the noisy-or, as a model of the degree of conflict among competing hypotheses of a common observation.",0
"A definition of causality introduced by Halpern and Pearl, which uses structural equations, is reviewed. A more refined definition is then considered, which takes into account issues of normality and typicality, which are well known to affect causal ascriptions. Causality is typically an all-or-nothing notion: either A is a cause of B or it is not. An extension of the definition of causality to capture notions of degree of responsibility and degree of blame, due to Chockler and Halpern, is reviewed. For example, if someone wins an election 11-0, then each person who votes for him is less responsible for the victory than if he had won 6-5. Degree of blame takes into account an agent's epistemic state. Roughly speaking, the degree of blame of A for B is the expected degree of responsibility of A for B, taken over the epistemic state of an agent. Finally, the structural-equations definition of causality is compared to Wright's NESS test.",0
"The rigorous theoretical analyses of algorithms for #SAT have been proposed in the literature. As we know, previous algorithms for solving #SAT have been analyzed only regarding the number of variables as the parameter. However, the time complexity for solving #SAT instances depends not only on the number of variables, but also on the number of clauses. Therefore, it is significant to exploit the time complexity from the other point of view, i.e. the number of clauses. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving #2-SAT and #3-SAT with rigorous complexity analyses using the number of clauses as the parameter. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain the new worst-case upper bounds O(1.1892m) for #2-SAT and O(1.4142m) for #3-SAT, where m is the number of clauses.",0

"With the advances in information technology (IT) criminals are using cyberspace to commit numerous cyber crimes. Cyber infrastructures are highly vulnerable to intrusions and other threats. Physical devices and human intervention are not sufficient for monitoring and protection of these infrastructures; hence, there is a need for more sophisticated cyber defense systems that need to be flexible, adaptable and robust, and able to detect a wide variety of threats and make intelligent real-time decisions. Numerous bio-inspired computing methods of Artificial Intelligence have been increasingly playing an important role in cyber crime detection and prevention. The purpose of this study is to present advances made so far in the field of applying AI techniques for combating cyber crimes, to demonstrate how these techniques can be an effective tool for detection and prevention of cyber attacks, as well as to give the scope for future work.",0
"Analyzing huge amounts of spatial data plays an important role in many emerging analysis and decision-making domains such as healthcare, urban planning, agriculture and so on. For extracting meaningful knowledge from geographical data, the relationships between spatial data objects need to be analyzed. An important class of such relationships are topological relations like the connectedness or overlap between regions. While real-world geographical regions such as lakes or forests do not have exact boundaries and are fuzzy, most of the existing analysis methods neglect this inherent feature of topological relations. In this paper, we propose a method for handling the topological relations in spatial databases based on fuzzy region connection calculus (RCC). The proposed method is implemented in PostGIS spatial database and evaluated in analyzing the relationship of diseases as an important application domain. We also used our fuzzy RCC implementation for fuzzification of the skyline operator in spatial databases. The results of the evaluation show that our method provides a more realistic view of spatial relationships and gives more flexibility to the data analyst to extract meaningful and accurate results in comparison with the existing methods.",0
Current measures of machine intelligence are either difficult to evaluate or lack the ability to test a robot's problem-solving capacity in open worlds. We propose a novel evaluation framework based on the formal notion of MacGyver Test which provides a practical way for assessing the resilience and resourcefulness of artificial agents.,0
"Many real-world phenomena can be represented by a spatio-temporal signal: where, when, and how much. Social media is a tantalizing data source for those who wish to monitor such signals. Unlike most prior work, we assume that the target phenomenon is known and we are given a method to count its occurrences in social media. However, counting is plagued by sample bias, incomplete data, and, paradoxically, data scarcity -- issues inadequately addressed by prior work. We formulate signal recovery as a Poisson point process estimation problem. We explicitly incorporate human population bias, time delays and spatial distortions, and spatio-temporal regularization into the model to address the noisy count issues. We present an efficient optimization algorithm and discuss its theoretical properties. We show that our model is more accurate than commonly-used baselines. Finally, we present a case study on wildlife roadkill monitoring, where our model produces qualitatively convincing results.",0
"With a weighting scheme proportional to t, a traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm achieves a high probability convergence rate of O({\kappa}/T) for strongly convex functions, instead of O({\kappa} ln(T)/T). We also prove that an accelerated SGD algorithm also achieves a rate of O({\kappa}/T).",0
"The analysis of the adaptive behaviour of many different kinds of systems such as humans, animals and machines, requires more general ways of assessing their cognitive abilities. This need is strengthened by increasingly more tasks being analysed for and completed by a wider diversity of systems, including swarms and hybrids. The notion of universal test has recently emerged in the context of machine intelligence evaluation as a way to define and use the same cognitive test for a variety of systems, using some principled tasks and adapting the interface to each particular subject. However, how far can universal tests be taken? This paper analyses this question in terms of subjects, environments, space-time resolution, rewards and interfaces. This leads to a number of findings, insights and caveats, according to several levels where universal tests may be progressively more difficult to conceive, implement and administer. One of the most significant contributions is given by the realisation that more universal tests are defined as maximisations of less universal tests for a variety of configurations. This means that universal tests must be necessarily adaptive.",0
"The temporal phenomena have many facets that are studied by different communities. In Semantic Web, large heterogeneous data are handled and produced. These data often have informal, semi-formal or formal temporal information which must be interpreted by software agents. In this paper we present Human Time Ontology (HuTO) an RDFS ontology to annotate and represent temporal data. A major contribution of HuTO is the modeling of non-convex intervals giving the ability to write queries for this kind of interval. HuTO also incorporates normalization and reasoning rules to explicit certain information. HuTO also proposes an approach which associates a temporal dimension to the knowledge base content. This facilitates information retrieval by considering or not the temporal aspect.",0
"The Neural GPU is a recent model that can learn algorithms such as multi-digit binary addition and binary multiplication in a way that generalizes to inputs of arbitrary length. We show that there are two simple ways of improving the performance of the Neural GPU: by carefully designing a curriculum, and by increasing model size. The latter requires careful memory management, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory intensive. We find that these techniques to increase the set of algorithmic problems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to perform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long numbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which, surprisingly, has not been possible before). We have also been able to train the Neural GPU to evaluate long arithmetic expressions with multiple operands that require respecting the precedence order of the operands, although these have succeeded only in their binary representation, and not with 100\% accuracy.",0
"Multi objective (MO) optimization is an emerging field which is increasingly being implemented in many industries globally. In this work, the MO optimization of the extraction process of bioactive compounds from the Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis fruit was solved. Three swarm-based algorithms have been applied in conjunction with normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method to solve this MO problem. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique were implemented in this work. In addition, a novel Hopfield-enhanced particle swarm optimization was developed and applied to the extraction problem. By measuring the levels of dominance, the optimality of the approximate Pareto frontiers produced by all the algorithms were gauged and compared. Besides, by measuring the levels of convergence of the frontier, some understanding regarding the structure of the objective space in terms of its relation to the level of frontier dominance is uncovered. Detail comparative studies were conducted on all the algorithms employed and developed in this work.",0
"Halpern and Pearl introduced a definition of actual causality; Eiter and Lukasiewicz showed that computing whether X=x is a cause of Y=y is NP-complete in binary models (where all variables can take on only two values) and\ Sigma_2^P-complete in general models. In the final version of their paper, Halpern and Pearl slightly modified the definition of actual cause, in order to deal with problems pointed by Hopkins and Pearl. As we show, this modification has a nontrivial impact on the complexity of computing actual cause. To characterize the complexity, a new family D_k^P, k= 1, 2, 3, ..., of complexity classes is introduced, which generalizes the class DP introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (DP is just D_1^P). %joe2 %We show that the complexity of computing causality is $\D_2$-complete %under the new definition. Chockler and Halpern \citeyear{CH04} extended the We show that the complexity of computing causality under the updated definition is $D_2^P$-complete.",1
An architecture of a new neuro-fuzzy system is proposed. The basic idea of this approach is to tune both synaptic weights and membership functions with the help of the supervised learning and self-learning paradigms. The approach to solving the problem has to do with evolving online neuro-fuzzy systems that can process data under uncertainty conditions. The results prove the effectiveness of the developed architecture and the learning procedure.,0
"Conjunctive database queries have been extended with a mechanism for object creation to capture important applications such as data exchange, data integration, and ontology-based data access. Object creation generates new object identifiers in the result, that do not belong to the set of constants in the source database. The new object identifiers can be also seen as Skolem terms. Hence, object-creating conjunctive queries can also be regarded as restricted second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO tgds), considered in the data exchange literature.",0
"This work targets people identification in video based on the way they walk (i.e. gait). While classical methods typically derive gait signatures from sequences of binary silhouettes, in this work we explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning high-level descriptors from low-level motion features (i.e. optical flow components). We carry out a thorough experimental evaluation of the proposed CNN architecture on the challenging TUM-GAID dataset. The experimental results indicate that using spatio-temporal cuboids of optical flow as input data for CNN allows to obtain state-of-the-art results on the gait task with an image resolution eight times lower than the previously reported results (i.e. 80x60 pixels).",0
In this paper one presents a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on a dissimilarity function determined by three parameters. This algorithm can be considered a generalization of the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm for fuzzy clustering.,0
"With the boom in IT technology, the data sets used in application are more and more larger and are described by a huge number of attributes, therefore, the feature selection become an important discipline in Knowledge discovery and data mining, allowing the experts to select the most relevant features to improve the quality of their studies and to reduce the time processing of their algorithm. In addition to that, the data used by the applications become richer. They are now represented by a set of complex and structured objects, instead of simple numerical matrixes. The purpose of our algorithm is to do feature selection on rich data, called Boolean Symbolic Objects (BSOs). These objects are described by multivalued features. The BSOs are considered as higher level units which can model complex data, such as cluster of individuals, aggregated data or taxonomies. In this paper we will introduce a new feature selection criterion for BSOs, and we will explain how we improved its complexity.",0
"Detection rules have traditionally been designed for rational agents that minimize the Bayes risk (average decision cost). With the advent of crowd-sensing systems, there is a need to redesign binary hypothesis testing rules for behavioral agents, whose cognitive behavior is not captured by traditional utility functions such as Bayes risk. In this paper, we adopt prospect theory based models for decision makers. We consider special agent models namely optimists and pessimists in this paper, and derive optimal detection rules under different scenarios. Using an illustrative example, we also show how the decision rule of a human agent deviates from the Bayesian decision rule under various behavioral models, considered in this paper.",0
Probabilistic inference is a key computational challenge in statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence. The ability to represent complex high dimensional probability distributions in a compact form is the most important insight in the field of graphical models.,1
"We present and evaluate a new model for Natural Language Generation (NLG) in Spoken Dialogue Systems, based on statistical planning, given noisy feedback from the current generation context (e.g. a user and a surface realiser). We study its use in a standard NLG problem: how to present information (in this case a set of search results) to users, given the complex trade- offs between utterance length, amount of information conveyed, and cognitive load. We set these trade-offs by analysing existing MATCH data. We then train a NLG pol- icy using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which adapts its behaviour to noisy feed- back from the current generation context. This policy is compared to several base- lines derived from previous work in this area. The learned policy significantly out- performs all the prior approaches.",0
"Soft sets, as a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty, have recently gained considerable attention, including some successful applications in information processing, decision, demand analysis, and forecasting. To construct new soft sets from given soft sets, some operations on soft sets have been proposed. Unfortunately, such operations cannot keep all classical set-theoretic laws true for soft sets. In this paper, we redefine the intersection, complement, and difference of soft sets and investigate the algebraic properties of these operations along with a known union operation. We find that the new operation system on soft sets inherits all basic properties of operations on classical sets, which justifies our definitions.",0
"Path planning for multiple robots is well studied in the AI and robotics communities. For a given discretized environment, robots need to find collision-free paths to a set of specified goal locations. Robots can be fully anonymous, non-anonymous, or organized in groups. Although powerful solvers for this abstract problem exist, they make simplifying assumptions by ignoring kinematic constraints, making it difficult to use the resulting plans on actual robots. In this paper, we present a solution which takes kinematic constraints, such as maximum velocities, into account, while guaranteeing a user-specified minimum safety distance between robots. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and on real robots in 2D and 3D environments.",0
"Classification is one of the major issues in Data Mining Research fields. The classification problems in medical area often classify medical dataset based on the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the medical practitioner. This research work discusses the classification process of Gene Expression data for three different cancers which are breast cancer, lung cancer and leukemia cancer with two classes which are cancerous stage and non cancerous stage. We have applied a fuzzy soft set similarity based classifier to enhance the accuracy to predict the stages among cancer genes and the informative genes are selected by using Entopy filtering.",0
"Usage of online textual media is steadily increasing. Daily, more and more news stories, blog posts and scientific articles are added to the online volumes. These are all freely accessible and have been employed extensively in multiple research areas, e.g. automatic text summarization, information retrieval, information extraction, etc. Meanwhile, online debate forums have recently become popular, but have remained largely unexplored. For this reason, there are no sufficient resources of annotated debate data available for conducting research in this genre. In this paper, we collected and annotated debate data for an automatic summarization task. Similar to extractive gold standard summary generation our data contains sentences worthy to include into a summary. Five human annotators performed this task. Inter-annotator agreement, based on semantic similarity, is 36% for Cohen's kappa and 48% for Krippendorff's alpha. Moreover, we also implement an extractive summarization system for online debates and discuss prominent features for the task of summarizing online debate data automatically.",0
"A methodology for the development of a fuzzy expert system (FES) with application to earthquake prediction is presented. The idea is to reproduce the performance of a human expert in earthquake prediction. To do this, at the first step, rules provided by the human expert are used to generate a fuzzy rule base. These rules are then fed into an inference engine to produce a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and to infer the results. In this paper, we have used a Sugeno type fuzzy inference system to build the FES. At the next step, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to refine the FES parameters and improve its performance. The proposed framework is then employed to attain the performance of a human expert used to predict earthquakes in the Zagros area based on the idea of coupled earthquakes. While the prediction results are promising in parts of the testing set, the general performance indicates that prediction methodology based on coupled earthquakes needs more investigation and more complicated reasoning procedure to yield satisfactory predictions.",0
"Understanding user instructions in natural language is an active research topic in AI and robotics. Typically, natural user instructions are high-level and can be reduced into low-level tasks expressed in common verbs (e.g., `take', `get', `put'). For robots understanding such instructions, one of the key challenges is to process high-level user instructions and achieve the specified tasks with robots' primitive actions. To address this, we propose novel algorithms by utilizing semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries and integrating multiple open knowledge to generate task plans. Specifically, we present a new method for matching and recovering semantics of user instructions and a novel task planner that exploits functional knowledge of robot's action model. To verify and evaluate our approach, we implemented a prototype system using knowledge from several open resources. Experiments on our system confirmed the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms. Notably, our system has been deployed in the KeJia robot, which participated the annual RoboCup@Home competitions in the past three years and achieved encouragingly high scores in the benchmark tests.",0
"The evaluation of Datalog rules over large Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is essential for many applications. In this paper, we present a new method of materializing Datalog inferences, which combines a column-based memory layout with novel optimization methods that avoid redundant inferences at runtime. The pro-active caching of certain subqueries further increases efficiency. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach can often match or even surpass the performance of state-of-the-art systems, especially under restricted resources.",0
"Although the traits emerged in a mass gathering are often non-deliberative, the act of mass impulse may lead to irre- vocable crowd disasters. The two-fold increase of carnage in crowd since the past two decades has spurred significant advances in the field of computer vision, towards effective and proactive crowd surveillance. Computer vision stud- ies related to crowd are observed to resonate with the understanding of the emergent behavior in physics (complex systems) and biology (animal swarm). These studies, which are inspired by biology and physics, share surprisingly common insights, and interesting contradictions. However, this aspect of discussion has not been fully explored. Therefore, this survey provides the readers with a review of the state-of-the-art methods in crowd behavior analysis from the physics and biologically inspired perspectives. We provide insights and comprehensive discussions for a broader understanding of the underlying prospect of blending physics and biology studies in computer vision.",0
"In this paper, we propose a method for extracting the geometries of interest (GOIs) of a mobile object which we define as the geometries of the points of interest (POIs) which a mobile object frequently visits. Based on extracted GOIs the area of a long-term GPS trajectory is partitioned into a grid area with inhomogeneous shaped cells. This proposes a method consists of three phases: (i) extracting the geometry of stay regions based on the concepts of time-value and the time-weighted centroid, (ii) determining the geometry of destination regions based on the extracted stay regions using a geometry based hierarchical clustering, and (iii) partitioning the trajectory area based on the geometry of the destination regions and their visit frequency. The extracted GOIs can effectively represent the geometries of the POIs of the mobile object while guaranteeing the characteristics of a valid partitioning. The proposed method is tested using a field database covering the trajectory of a mobile object with the length of 3.5 years, and the achieved results are compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experimental results show that the proposed stay extraction can detect valid stay regions with only one track point while the other methods lose those stays. Moreover, analysis of the outcomes of the method using empirical observation shows that the quality of the extracted stay regions, destination regions and the GOIs extracted by our proposed method is considerably higher than those extracted by methods proposed in the state-of-the-art.",0
"Bound propagation is an important Artificial Intelligence technique used in Constraint Programming tools to deal with numerical constraints. It is typically embedded within a search procedure (""branch and prune"") and used at every node of the search tree to narrow down the search space, so it is critical that it be fast. The procedure invokes constraint propagators until a common fixpoint is reached, but the known algorithms for this have a pseudo-polynomial worst-case time complexity: they are fast indeed when the variables have a small numerical range, but they have the well-known problem of being prohibitively slow when these ranges are large. An important question is therefore whether strongly-polynomial algorithms exist that compute the common bound consistent fixpoint of a set of constraints. This paper answers this question. In particular we show that this fixpoint computation is in fact NP-complete, even when restricted to binary linear constraints.",0
We introduce K-tree in an information retrieval context. It is an efficient approximation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Unlike k-means it forms a hierarchy of clusters. It has been extended to address issues with sparse representations. We compare performance and quality to CLUTO using document collections. The K-tree has a low time complexity that is suitable for large document collections. This tree structure allows for efficient disk based implementations where space requirements exceed that of main memory.,0
"We consider the task of predicting lexical entailment using distributional vectors. We focus experiments on one previous classifier which was shown to only learn to detect prototypicality of a word pair. Analysis shows that the model single-mindedly learns to detect Hearst Patterns, which are well known to be predictive of lexical relations. We present a new model which exploits this Hearst Detector functionality, matching or outperforming prior work on multiple data sets.",1
"In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a minimum common partition of two strings (MCSP). The problem has its application in genome comparison. As it is an NP-hard, discrete combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a metaheuristic technique, namely, MAX-MIN ant system to solve this. The experimental results are found to be promising.",0
"Temporal abstraction is key to scaling up learning and planning in reinforcement learning. While planning with temporally extended actions is well understood, creating such abstractions autonomously from data has remained challenging. We tackle this problem in the framework of options [Sutton, Precup &amp; Singh, 1999; Precup, 2000]. We derive policy gradient theorems for options and propose a new option-critic architecture capable of learning both the internal policies and the termination conditions of options, in tandem with the policy over options, and without the need to provide any additional rewards or subgoals. Experimental results in both discrete and continuous environments showcase the flexibility and efficiency of the framework.",1
"Bribery in elections is an important problem in computational social choice theory. However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent computational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to capture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber is frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a certain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber. We further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem namely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery where the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or different.",1
"Many advances in research regarding immuno-interactions with cancer were developed with the help of ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. These models, however, are not effectively capable of representing problems involving individual localisation, memory and emerging properties, which are common characteristics of cells and molecules of the immune system. Agent-based modelling and simulation is an alternative paradigm to ODE models that overcomes these limitations. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation when compared to ODE modelling and simulation. We seek answers to the following questions: Is it possible to obtain an equivalent agent-based model from the ODE formulation? Do the outcomes differ? Are there any benefits of using one method compared to the other? To answer these questions, we have considered three case studies using established mathematical models of immune interactions with early-stage cancer. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and the simulation results were then compared with those from the ODE models. Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent agent-based models (i.e. implementing the same mechanisms); the simulation output of both types of models however might differ depending on the attributes of the system to be modelled. In some cases, additional insight from using agent-based modelling was obtained. Overall, we can confirm that agent-based modelling is a useful addition to the tool set of immunologists, as it has extra features that allow for simulations with characteristics that are closer to the biological phenomena.",0
"Algorithmic composition is the partial or total automation of the process of music composition by using computers. Since the 1950s, different computational techniques related to Artificial Intelligence have been used for algorithmic composition, including grammatical representations, probabilistic methods, neural networks, symbolic rule-based systems, constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms. This survey aims to be a comprehensive account of research on algorithmic composition, presenting a thorough view of the field for researchers in Artificial Intelligence.",0
"Balancing fairness and efficiency in resource allocation is a classical economic and computational problem. The price of fairness measures the worst-case loss of economic efficiency when using an inefficient but fair allocation rule; for indivisible goods in many settings, this price is unacceptably high. In this work, we propose a hybrid fairness rule that balances a strict lexicographic preference ordering over classes of agents and a utilitarian objective that maximizes economic efficiency. We develop a utility function that favors disadvantaged groups lexicographically; but if cost to overall efficiency becomes too high, it smoothly switches to a utilitarian objective. This rule has only one parameter which is proportional to a bound on the price of fairness, and can be adjusted by policymakers. We apply this rule to kidney exchange, where needy patients swap willing but incompatible donors, and demonstrate on real data from a large exchange that our hybrid rule produces more reliable outcomes than other fairness rules.",0
"The advances of the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative are giving rise to a more structured web of data. Indeed, a few datasets act as hubs (e.g., DBpedia) connecting many other datasets. They also made possible new web services for entity detection inside plain text (e.g., DBpedia Spotlight), thus allowing for new applications that will benefit from a combination of the web of documents and the web of data. To ease the emergence of these new use-cases, we propose a query-biased algorithm for the ranking of entities detected inside a web page. Our algorithm combine link analysis with dimensionality reduction. We use crowdsourcing for building a publicly available and reusable dataset on which we compare our algorithm to the state of the art. Finally, we use this algorithm for the construction of semantic snippets for which we evaluate the usability and the usefulness with a crowdsourcing-based approach.",0
"We present a family of logics for reasoning about agents' positions and motion in the plane which have several potential applications in the area of multi-agent systems (MAS), such as multi-agent planning and robotics. The most general logic includes (i) atomic formulas for representing the truth of a given fact or the presence of a given agent at a certain position of the plane, (ii) atomic programs corresponding to the four basic orientations in the plane (up, down, left, right) as well as the four program constructs of propositional dynamic logic (sequential composition, nondeterministic composition, iteration and test). As this logic is not computably enumerable, we study some interesting decidable and axiomatizable fragments of it. We also present a decidable extension of the iteration-free fragment of the logic by special programs representing motion of agents in the plane.",0
"Modern solvers for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) are based on sophisticated Boolean constraint solving techniques. In both areas, conflict-driven learning and related techniques constitute key features whose application is enabled by conflict analysis. Although various conflict analysis schemes have been proposed, implemented, and studied both theoretically and practically in the SAT area, the heuristic aspects involved in conflict analysis have not yet received much attention. Assuming a fixed conflict analysis scheme, we address the open question of how to identify ""good'' reasons for conflicts, and we investigate several heuristics for conflict analysis in ASP solving. To our knowledge, a systematic study like ours has not yet been performed in the SAT area, thus, it might be beneficial for both the field of ASP as well as the one of SAT solving.",0
"The ad hoc coordination problem is to design an autonomous agent which is able to achieve optimal flexibility and efficiency in a multiagent system with no mechanisms for prior coordination. We conceptualise this problem formally using a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the behaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal control. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative algorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly higher welfare and winning rate.",0
"We present new algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from data with missing values without the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). An exact Bayesian network learning algorithm is obtained by recasting the problem into a standard Bayesian network learning problem without missing data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact algorithm for this problem. As expected, the exact algorithm does not scale to large domains. We build on the exact method to create a new approximate algorithm using a hill-climbing technique. This algorithm scales to large domains so long as a suitable standard structure learning method for complete data is available. We perform a wide range of experiments to demonstrate the benefits of learning Bayesian networks without assuming MAR.",1
"We show that the Bellman operator underlying the options framework leads to a matrix splitting, an approach traditionally used to speed up convergence of iterative solvers for large linear systems of equations. Based on standard comparison theo- rems for matrix splittings, we then show how the asymptotic rate of convergence varies as a function of the inherent timescales of the options. This new perspective highlights a trade-off between asymptotic performance and the cost of computation associated with building a good set of options.",0
Process mining is a technique that performs an automatic analysis of business processes from a log of events with the promise of understanding how processes are executed in an organisation.,0
"Circumscription is a representative example of a nonmonotonic reasoning inference technique. Circumscription has often been studied for first order theories, but its propositional version has also been the subject of extensive research, having been shown equivalent to extended closed world assumption (ECWA). Moreover, entailment in propositional circumscription is a well-known example of a decision problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. This paper proposes a new Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithm for entailment in propositional circumscription that explores the relationship of propositional circumscription to minimal models. The new algorithm is inspired by ideas commonly used in SAT-based model checking, namely counterexample guided abstraction refinement. In addition, the new algorithm is refined to compute the theory closure for generalized close world assumption (GCWA). Experimental results show that the new algorithm can solve problem instances that other solutions are unable to solve.",0
"An inconsistent knowledge base can be abstracted as a set of arguments and a defeat relation among them. There can be more than one consistent way to evaluate such an argumentation graph. Collective argument evaluation is the problem of aggregating the opinions of multiple agents on how a given set of arguments should be evaluated. It is crucial not only to ensure that the outcome is logically consistent, but also satisfies measures of social optimality and immunity to strategic manipulation. This is because agents have their individual preferences about what the outcome ought to be. In the current paper, we analyze three previously introduced argument-based aggregation operators with respect to Pareto optimality and strategy proofness under different general classes of agent preferences. We highlight fundamental trade-offs between strategic manipulability and social optimality on one hand, and classical logical criteria on the other. Our results motivate further investigation into the relationship between social choice and argumentation theory. The results are also relevant for choosing an appropriate aggregation operator given the criteria that are considered more important, as well as the nature of agents' preferences.",0
"State-space search with explicit abstraction heuristics is at the state of the art of cost-optimal planning. These heuristics are inherently limited, nonetheless, because the size of the abstract space must be bounded by some, even if a very large, constant. Targeting this shortcoming, we introduce the notion of (additive) implicit abstractions, in which the planning task is abstracted by instances of tractable fragments of optimal planning. We then introduce a concrete setting of this framework, called fork-decomposition, that is based on two novel fragments of tractable cost-optimal planning. The induced admissible heuristics are then studied formally and empirically. This study testifies for the accuracy of the fork decomposition heuristics, yet our empirical evaluation also stresses the tradeoff between their accuracy and the runtime complexity of computing them. Indeed, some of the power of the explicit abstraction heuristics comes from precomputing the heuristic function offline and then determining h(s) for each evaluated state s by a very fast lookup in a database. By contrast, while fork-decomposition heuristics can be calculated in polynomial time, computing them is far from being fast. To address this problem, we show that the time-per-node complexity bottleneck of the fork-decomposition heuristics can be successfully overcome. We demonstrate that an equivalent of the explicit abstraction notion of a database exists for the fork-decomposition abstractions as well, despite their exponential-size abstract spaces. We then verify empirically that heuristic search with the databased"" fork-decomposition heuristics favorably competes with the state of the art of cost-optimal planning.",0
"Universal induction is a crucial issue in AGI. Its practical applicability can be achieved by the choice of the reference machine or representation of algorithms agreed with the environment. This machine should be updatable for solving subsequent tasks more efficiently. We study this problem on an example of combinatory logic as the very simple Turing-complete reference machine, which enables modifying program representations by introducing different sets of primitive combinators. Genetic programming system is used to search for combinator expressions, which are easily decomposed into sub-expressions being recombined in crossover. Our experiments show that low-complexity induction or prediction tasks can be solved by the developed system (much more efficiently than using brute force); useful combinators can be revealed and included into the representation simplifying more difficult tasks. However, optimal sets of combinators depend on the specific task, so the reference machine should be adaptively chosen in coordination with the search engine.",0
This paper develops a measure for bounding the performance of AND/OR search algorithms for solving a variety of queries over graphical models. We show how drawing a connection to the recent notion of hypertree decompositions allows to exploit determinism in the problem specification and produce tighter bounds. We demonstrate on a variety of practical problem instances that we are often able to improve upon existing bounds by several orders of magnitude.,0
"The presence of latent variables can greatly complicate inferences about causal relations between measured variables from statistical data. In many cases, the presence of latent variables makes it impossible to determine for two measured variables A and B, whether A causes B, B causes A, or there is some common cause. In this paper I present several theorems that state conditions under which it is possible to reliably infer the causal relation between two measured variables, regardless of whether latent variables are acting or not.",0
"Deep neural network architectures have recently produced excellent results in a variety of areas in artificial intelligence and visual recognition, well surpassing traditional shallow architectures trained using hand-designed features. The power of deep networks stems both from their ability to perform local computations followed by pointwise non-linearities over increasingly larger receptive fields, and from the simplicity and scalability of the gradient-descent training procedure based on backpropagation. An open problem is the inclusion of layers that perform global, structured matrix computations like segmentation (e.g. normalized cuts) or higher-order pooling (e.g. log-tangent space metrics defined over the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices) while preserving the validity and efficiency of an end-to-end deep training framework. In this paper we propose a sound mathematical apparatus to formally integrate global structured computation into deep computation architectures. At the heart of our methodology is the development of the theory and practice of backpropagation that generalizes to the calculus of adjoint matrix variations. We perform segmentation experiments using the BSDS and MSCOCO benchmarks and demonstrate that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers.",0
"The paper continues the investigation of Poincare and Russel's Vicious Circle Principle (VCP) in the context of the design of logic programming languages with sets. We expand previously introduced language Alog with aggregates by allowing infinite sets and several additional set related constructs useful for knowledge representation and teaching. In addition, we propose an alternative formalization of the original VCP and incorporate it into the semantics of new language, Slog+, which allows more liberal construction of sets and their use in programming rules. We show that, for programs without disjunction and infinite sets, the formal semantics of aggregates in Slog+ coincides with that of several other known languages. Their intuitive and formal semantics, however, are based on quite different ideas and seem to be more involved than that of Slog+.",0
"A directed graph where there is exactly one edge between every pair of vertices is called a {\em tournament}. Finding the ""best"" set of vertices of a tournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\em tournament solution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some tournament solution) by ""querying"" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper, precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an oracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few edges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\lfloor \log n \rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm for finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\lfloor \log n \rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament solutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the top cycle must query $\Omega(n^2)$ edges in the worst case. On the positive side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at most $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by querying $O(nk + \frac{n\log n}{\log(1-\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.",1
"We investigate projection methods, for evaluating a linear approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process context. We consider two popular approaches, the one-step Temporal Difference fix-point computation (TD(0)) and the Bellman Residual (BR) minimization. We describe examples, where each method outperforms the other. We highlight a simple relation between the objective function they minimize, and show that while BR enjoys a performance guarantee, TD(0) does not in general. We then propose a unified view in terms of oblique projections of the Bellman equation, which substantially simplifies and extends the characterization of (schoknecht,2002) and the recent analysis of (Yu &amp; Bertsekas, 2008). Eventually, we describe some simulations that suggest that if the TD(0) solution is usually slightly better than the BR solution, its inherent numerical instability makes it very bad in some cases, and thus worse on average.",1
"This paper discusses techniques for performing efficient decision-theoretic planning. We give an overview of the DRIPS decision-theoretic refinement planning system, which uses abstraction to efficiently identify optimal plans. We present techniques for automatically generating search control information, which can significantly improve the planner's performance. We evaluate the efficiency of DRIPS both with and without the search control rules on a complex medical planning problem and compare its performance to that of a branch-and-bound decision tree algorithm.",0
"Structure and parameters in a Bayesian network uniquely specify the probability distribution of the modeled domain. The locality of both structure and probabilistic information are the great benefits of Bayesian networks and require the modeler to only specify local information. On the other hand this locality of information might prevent the modeler - and even more any other person - from obtaining a general overview of the important relationships within the domain. The goal of the work presented in this paper is to provide an ""alternative"" view on the knowledge encoded in a Bayesian network which might sometimes be very helpful for providing insights into the underlying domain. The basic idea is to calculate a mixture approximation to the probability distribution represented by the Bayesian network. The mixture component densities can be thought of as representing typical scenarios implied by the Bayesian model, providing intuition about the basic relationships. As an additional benefit, performing inference in the approximate model is very simple and intuitive and can provide additional insights. The computational complexity for the calculation of the mixture approximations criticaly depends on the measure which defines the distance between the probability distribution represented by the Bayesian network and the approximate distribution. Both the KL-divergence and the backward KL-divergence lead to inefficient algorithms. Incidentally, the latter is used in recent work on mixtures of mean field solutions to which the work presented here is closely related. We show, however, that using a mean squared error cost function leads to update equations which can be solved using the junction tree algorithm. We conclude that the mean squared error cost function can be used for Bayesian networks in which inference based on the junction tree is tractable. For large networks, however, one may have to rely on mean field approximations.",0
"Statistical language models are central to many applications that use semantics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are known to produce state of the art results for language modelling, outperforming their traditional n-gram counterparts in many cases. To generate a probability distribution across a vocabulary, these models require a softmax output layer that linearly increases in size with the size of the vocabulary. Large vocabularies need a commensurately large softmax layer and training them on typical laptops/PCs requires significant time and machine resources. In this paper we present a new technique for implementing RNN based large vocabulary language models that substantially speeds up computation while optimally using the limited memory resources. Our technique, while building on the notion of factorizing the output layer by having multiple output layers, improves on the earlier work by substantially optimizing on the individual output layer size and also eliminating the need for a multistep prediction process.",0
"Different machine learning techniques have been proposed and used for modeling individual and group user needs, interests and preferences. In the traditional predictive modeling instances are described by observable variables, called attributes. The goal is to learn a model for predicting the target variable for unseen instances. For example, for marketing purposes a company consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing behavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world applications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be actively decided by a decision maker. Furthermore, in some of such applications the decision maker is interested not only to generate accurate predictions, but to maximize the probability of the desired outcome. For example, a direct marketing manager can choose which type of a special offer to send to a client (actionable attribute), hoping that the right choice will result in a positive response with a higher probability. We study how to learn to choose the value of an actionable attribute in order to maximize the probability of a desired outcome in predictive modeling. We emphasize that not all instances are equally sensitive to changes in actions. Accurate choice of an action is critical for those instances, which are on the borderline (e.g. users who do not have a strong opinion one way or the other). We formulate three supervised learning approaches for learning to select the value of an actionable attribute at an instance level. We also introduce a focused training procedure which puts more emphasis on the situations where varying the action is the most likely to take the effect. The proof of concept experimental validation on two real-world case studies in web analytics and e-learning domains highlights the potential of the proposed approaches.",0
"Recent research in decision theoretic planning has focussed on making the solution of Markov decision processes (MDPs) more feasible. We develop a family of algorithms for structured reachability analysis of MDPs that are suitable when an initial state (or set of states) is known. Using compact, structured representations of MDPs (e.g., Bayesian networks), our methods, which vary in the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, produce structured descriptions of (estimated) reachable states that can be used to eliminate variables or variable values from the problem description, reducing the size of the MDP and making it easier to solve. One contribution of our work is the extension of ideas from GRAPHPLAN to deal with the distributed nature of action representations typically embodied within Bayes nets and the problem of correlated action effects. We also demonstrate that our algorithm can be made more complete by using k-ary constraints instead of binary constraints. Another contribution is the illustration of how the compact representation of reachability constraints can be exploited by several existing (exact and approximate) abstraction algorithms for MDPs.",0
"Recent trends in planning research have led to empirical comparison becoming commonplace. The field has started to settle into a methodology for such comparisons, which for obvious practical reasons requires running a subset of planners on a subset of problems. In this paper, we characterize the methodology and examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners and metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions are: PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor syntactic differences in representation do not affect performance, and PR3) problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL. The planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best one to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and PL3) time cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are: M1) performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on degraded runtime environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the number of plan steps distinguishes performance. We find that most of these assumptions are not supported empirically; in particular, that planners are affected differently by these assumptions. We conclude with a call to the community to devote research resources to improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing the available benchmark problems.",0
"Email classification is still a mostly manual task. Consequently, most Web mail users never define a single folder. Recently however, automatic classification offering the same categories to all users has started to appear in some Web mail clients, such as AOL or Gmail. We adopt this approach, rather than previous (unsuccessful) personalized approaches because of the change in the nature of consumer email traffic, which is now dominated by (non-spam) machine-generated email. We propose here a novel approach for (1) automatically distinguishing between personal and machine-generated email and (2) classifying messages into latent categories, without requiring users to have defined any folder. We report how we have discovered that a set of 6 ""latent"" categories (one for human- and the others for machine-generated messages) can explain a significant portion of email traffic. We describe in details the steps involved in building a Web-scale email categorization system, from the collection of ground-truth labels, the selection of features to the training of models. Experimental evaluation was performed on more than 500 billion messages received during a period of six months by users of Yahoo mail service, who elected to be part of such research studies. Our system achieved precision and recall rates close to 90% and the latent categories we discovered were shown to cover 70% of both email traffic and email search queries. We believe that these results pave the way for a change of approach in the Web mail industry, and could support the invention of new large-scale email discovery paradigms that had not been possible before.",0
"This paper presents a Bayesian method for constructing Bayesian belief networks from a database of cases.

We relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.",0

"A new method is developed to represent probabilistic relations on multiple random events. Where previously knowledge bases containing probabilistic rules were used for this purpose, here a probability distribution over the relations is directly represented by a Bayesian network. By using a powerful way of specifying conditional probability distributions in these networks, the resulting formalism is more expressive than the previous ones. Particularly, it provides for constraints on equalities of events, and it allows to define complex, nested combination functions.",0
"We introduce a method for learning the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems based on deep generative models over temporal segments of states and actions. Unlike dynamics models that operate over individual discrete timesteps, we learn the distribution over future state trajectories conditioned on past state, past action, and planned future action trajectories, as well as a latent prior over action trajectories. Our approach is based on convolutional autoregressive models and variational autoencoders. It makes stable and accurate predictions over long horizons for complex, stochastic systems, effectively expressing uncertainty and modeling the effects of collisions, sensory noise, and action delays. The learned dynamics model and action prior can be used for end-to-end, fully differentiable trajectory optimization and model-based policy optimization, which we use to evaluate the performance and sample-efficiency of our method.",1
The NMR community would like to build a repository of benchmarks to push forward the design of systems implementing NMR as it has been the case for many other areas in AI. There are a number of lessons which can be learned from the experience of other communi- ties. Here are a few thoughts about the requirements and choices to make before building such a repository.,0
"Qualitative and infinitesimal probability schemes are consistent with the axioms of probability theory, but avoid the need for precise numerical probabilities. Using qualitative probabilities could substantially reduce the effort for knowledge engineering and improve the robustness of results. We examine experimentally how well infinitesimal probabilities (the kappa-calculus of Goldszmidt and Pearl) perform a diagnostic task - troubleshooting a car that will not start by comparison with a conventional numerical belief network. We found the infinitesimal scheme to be as good as the numerical scheme in identifying the true fault. The performance of the infinitesimal scheme worsens significantly for prior fault probabilities greater than 0.03. These results suggest that infinitesimal probability methods may be of substantial practical value for machine diagnosis with small prior fault probabilities.",0
"Classical logic has a serious limitation in that it cannot cope with the issues of vagueness and uncertainty into which fall most modes of human reasoning. In order to provide a foundation for human knowledge representation and reasoning in the presence of vagueness, imprecision, and uncertainty, fuzzy logic should have the ability to deal with linguistic hedges, which play a very important role in the modification of fuzzy predicates. In this paper, we extend fuzzy logic in narrow sense with graded syntax, introduced by Novak et al., with many hedge connectives. In one case, each hedge does not have any dual one. In the other case, each hedge can have its own dual one. The resulting logics are shown to also have the Pavelka-style completeness",0
"Certain constructs allowed in Mizar articles cannot be represented in first-order logic but can be represented in higher-order logic. We describe a way to obtain higher-order theorem proving problems from Mizar articles that make use of these constructs. In particular, higher-order logic is used to represent schemes, a global choice construct and set level binders. The higher-order automated theorem provers Satallax and LEO-II have been run on collections of these problems and the results are discussed.",0
"This chapter overviews a recently introduced network-based model of combinatorial landscapes: Local Optima Networks (LON). The model compresses the information given by the whole search space into a smaller mathematical object that is a graph having as vertices the local optima and as edges the possible weighted transitions between them. Two definitions of edges have been proposed: basin-transition and escape-edges, which capture relevant topological features of the underlying search spaces. This network model brings a new set of metrics to characterize the structure of combinatorial landscapes, those associated with the science of complex networks. These metrics are described, and results are presented of local optima network extraction and analysis for two selected combinatorial landscapes: NK landscapes and the quadratic assignment problem. Network features are found to correlate with and even predict the performance of heuristic search algorithms operating on these problems.",0

"This paper presents an adaptation of the harmony search algorithm to solve the storage allocation problem for inbound and outbound containers. This problem is studied considering multiple container type (regular, open side, open top, tank, empty and refrigerated) which lets the situation more complicated, as various storage constraints appeared. The objective is to find an optimal container arrangement which respects their departure dates, and minimize the re-handle operations of containers. The performance of the proposed approach is verified comparing to the results generated by genetic algorithm and LIFO algorithm.",0
"Students in online courses generate large amounts of data that can be used to personalize the learning process and improve quality of education. In this paper, we present the Latent Skill Embedding (LSE), a probabilistic model of students and educational content that can be used to recommend personalized sequences of lessons with the goal of helping students prepare for specific assessments. Akin to collaborative filtering for recommender systems, the algorithm does not require students or content to be described by features, but it learns a representation using access traces. We formulate this problem as a regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of students, lessons, and assessments from historical student-content interactions. An empirical evaluation on large-scale data from Knewton, an adaptive learning technology company, shows that this approach predicts assessment results competitively with benchmark models and is able to discriminate between lesson sequences that lead to mastery and failure.",0
"Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are a powerful formalism for reasoning under uncertainty but bear some severe limitations: they require a large amount of information before any reasoning process can start, they have limited contradiction handling capabilities, and their ability to provide explanations for their conclusion is still controversial. There exists a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (TMSs), which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge, to provide well-founded explanation for their conclusions, and to detect and handle contradictions. TMSs incorporating measure of uncertainty are called Belief Maintenance Systems (BMSs). This paper describes how a BMS based on probabilistic logic can be applied to BBNs, thus introducing a new class of BBNs, called Ignorant Belief Networks, able to incrementally deal with partially specified conditional dependencies, to provide explanations, and to detect and handle contradictions.",0
"Conformant planning is the problem of finding a sequence of actions for achieving a goal in the presence of uncertainty in the initial state or action effects. The problem has been approached as a path-finding problem in belief space where good belief representations and heuristics are critical for scaling up. In this work, a different formulation is introduced for conformant problems with deterministic actions where they are automatically converted into classical ones and solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner. The translation maps literals L and sets of assumptions t about the initial situation, into new literals KL/t that represent that L must be true if t is initially true. We lay out a general translation scheme that is sound and establish the conditions under which the translation is also complete. We show that the complexity of the complete translation is exponential in a parameter of the problem called the conformant width, which for most benchmarks is bounded. The planner based on this translation exhibits good performance in comparison with existing planners, and is the basis for T0, the best performing planner in the Conformant Track of the 2006 International Planning Competition.",0
The area of computation called artificial intelligence (AI) is falsified by describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British applied mathematician James Lighthill. It is explained how Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to current AI. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian scientific method in which it is the duty of every scientist to attempt to falsify theories and if theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper describes the Popperian method in detail and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the method to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior. Arguments used by Lighthill in his original 1972 report that falsifed AI are discussed. The Lighthill arguments are then shown to apply to current AI. The argument uses recent scholarship to explain Lighthill's assumptions and to show how the arguments based on those assumptions continue to falsify modern AI. An iimportant focus of the argument involves Hilbert's philosophical programme that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal sentences. Current AI takes the Hilbert programme as dogma beyond criticism while Lighthill as a mid 20th century applied mathematician had abandoned it. The paper uses recent scholarship to explain John von Neumann's criticism of AI that I claim was assumed by Lighthill. The paper discusses computer chess programs to show Lighthill's combinatorial explosion still applies to AI but not humans. An argument showing that Turing Machines (TM) are not the correct description of computation is given. The paper concludes by advocating studying computation as Peter Naur's Dataology.,0

"Phase transitions in many complex combinational problems have been widely studied in the past decade. In this paper, we investigate phase transitions in the knowledge compilation empirically, where DFA, OBDD and d-DNNF are chosen as the target languages to compile random k-SAT instances and industrial-like SAT instances. We perform intensive experiments to analyze the sizes of compilation results and draw the following conclusions: there exists an easy-hard-easy pattern in compilations; the peak point of sizes in the pattern is only related to the ratio of the number of clauses to that of variables when k is fixed, regardless of target languages; most sizes of compilation results increase exponentially with the number of variables growing, but there also exists a phase transition that separates a polynomial-increment region from the exponential-increment region; Moreover, we explain why the phase transition in compilations occurs by analyzing microstructures of DFAs, and conclude that a kind of solution interchangeability with more than 2 variables has a sharp transition near the peak point of the easy-hard-easy pattern, and thus it has great impact on the sizes of DFAs.",0
"In this paper we present a new way of predicting the performance of a reinforcement learning policy given historical data that may have been generated by a different policy. The ability to evaluate a policy from historical data is important for applications where the deployment of a bad policy can be dangerous or costly. We show empirically that our algorithm produces estimates that often have orders of magnitude lower mean squared error than existing methods---it makes more efficient use of the available data. Our new estimator is based on two advances: an extension of the doubly robust estimator (Jiang and Li, 2015), and a new way to mix between model based estimates and importance sampling based estimates.",1
"Logic-based event recognition systems infer occurrences of events in time using a set of event definitions in the form of first-order rules. The Event Calculus is a temporal logic that has been used as a basis in event recognition applications, providing among others, direct connections to machine learning, via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). OLED is a recently proposed ILP system that learns event definitions in the form of Event Calculus theories, in a single pass over a data stream. In this work we present a version of OLED that allows for distributed, online learning. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark activity recognition dataset and show that we can significantly reduce training times, exchanging minimal information between processing nodes.",0
"Detection of non-technical losses (NTL) which include electricity theft, faulty meters or billing errors has attracted increasing attention from researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs cause significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is employing artificial intelligence (AI) to solve this problem. Promising approaches have been reported falling into two categories: expert systems incorporating hand-crafted expert knowledge or machine learning, also called pattern recognition or data mining, which learns fraudulent consumption patterns from examples without being explicitly programmed. This paper first provides an overview about how NTLs are defined and their impact on economies. Next, it covers the fundamental pillars of AI relevant to this domain. It then surveys these research efforts in a comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally identifies the key scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and suggests how they could be solved. We believe that those challenges have not sufficiently been addressed in past contributions and that covering those is necessary in order to advance NTL detection.",0
"Disjunctive Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful declarative programming paradigm whose main decision problems are located on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Identifying tractable fragments and developing efficient algorithms for such fragments are thus important objectives in order to complement the sophisticated ASP systems available to date. Hard problems can become tractable if some problem parameter is bounded by a fixed constant; such problems are then called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). While several FPT results for ASP exist, parameters that relate to directed or signed graphs representing the program at hand have been neglected so far. In this paper, we first give some negative observations showing that directed width measures on the dependency graph of a program do not lead to FPT results. We then consider the graph parameter of signed clique-width and present a novel dynamic programming algorithm that is FPT w.r.t. this parameter. Clique-width is more general than the well-known treewidth, and, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first FPT algorithm for bounded clique-width for reasoning problems beyond SAT.",0
"The aim of this paper is to show the interest in fitting features with an $\alpha$-stable distribution to classify imperfect data. The supervised pattern recognition is thus based on the theory of continuous belief functions, which is a way to consider imprecision and uncertainty of data. The distributions of features are supposed to be unimodal and estimated by a single Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable model. Experimental results are first obtained from synthetic data by combining two features of one dimension and by considering a vector of two features. Mass functions are calculated from plausibility functions by using the generalized Bayes theorem. The same study is applied to the automatic classification of three types of sea floor (rock, silt and sand) with features acquired by a mono-beam echo-sounder. We evaluate the quality of the $\alpha$-stable model and the Gaussian model by analyzing qualitative results, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), and quantitative results with classification rates. The performances of the belief classifier are compared with a Bayesian approach.",0
"Despite the fact that different objects possess distinct class-specific features, they also usually share common patterns. This observation has been exploited partially in a recently proposed dictionary learning framework by separating the particularity and the commonality (COPAR). Inspired by this, we propose a novel method to explicitly and simultaneously learn a set of common patterns as well as class-specific features for classification with more intuitive constraints. Our dictionary learning framework is hence characterized by both a shared dictionary and particular (class-specific) dictionaries. For the shared dictionary, we enforce a low-rank constraint, i.e. claim that its spanning subspace should have low dimension and the coefficients corresponding to this dictionary should be similar. For the particular dictionaries, we impose on them the well-known constraints stated in the Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL). Further, we develop new fast and accurate algorithms to solve the subproblems in the learning step, accelerating its convergence. The said algorithms could also be applied to FDDL and its extensions. The efficiencies of these algorithms are theoretically and experimentally verified by comparing their complexities and running time with those of other well-known dictionary learning methods. Experimental results on widely used image datasets establish the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.",0
"Most of the existing graph embedding methods focus on nodes, which aim to output a vector representation for each node in the graph such that two nodes being ""close"" on the graph are close too in the low-dimensional space. Despite the success of embedding individual nodes for graph analytics, we notice that an important concept of embedding communities (i.e., groups of nodes) is missing. Embedding communities is useful, not only for supporting various community-level applications, but also to help preserve community structure in graph embedding. In fact, we see community embedding as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness, whereas most of the popular graph embedding methods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the community embedding, we hinge upon the insight that community embedding and node embedding reinforce with each other. As a result, we propose ComEmbed, the first community embedding method, which jointly optimizes the community embedding and node embedding together. We evaluate ComEmbed on real-world data sets. We show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks of node classification and community prediction.",0
"Knowledge graph embedding aims at translating the knowledge graph into numerical representations by transforming the entities and relations into con- tinuous low-dimensional vectors. Recently, many methods [1, 5, 3, 2, 6] have been proposed to deal with this problem, but existing single-thread implemen- tations of them are time-consuming for large-scale knowledge graphs. Here, we design a unified parallel framework to parallelize these methods, which achieves a significant time reduction without in uencing the accuracy. We name our framework as ParaGraphE, which provides a library for parallel knowledge graph embedding. The source code can be downloaded from https: //github.com/LIBBLE/LIBBLE-MultiThread/tree/master/ParaGraphE.",0
"In this paper, we develop a qualitative theory of influence diagrams that can be used to model and solve sequential decision making tasks when only qualitative (or imprecise) information is available. Our approach is based on an order-of-magnitude approximation of both probabilities and utilities and allows for specifying partially ordered preferences via sets of utility values. We also propose a dedicated variable elimination algorithm that can be applied for solving order-of-magnitude influence diagrams.",0
"Reinforcement learning is a general and powerful framework with which to study and implement artificial intelligence. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled RL algorithms to achieve impressive performance in restricted domains such as playing Atari video games (Mnih et al., 2015) and, recently, the board game Go (Silver et al., 2016). However, we are still far from constructing a generally intelligent agent. Many of the obstacles and open questions are conceptual: What does it mean to be intelligent? How does one explore and learn optimally in general, unknown environments? What, in fact, does it mean to be optimal in the general sense? The universal Bayesian agent AIXI (Hutter, 2005) is a model of a maximally intelligent agent, and plays a central role in the sub-field of general reinforcement learning (GRL). Recently, AIXI has been shown to be flawed in important ways; it doesn't explore enough to be asymptotically optimal (Orseau, 2010), and it can perform poorly with certain priors (Leike and Hutter, 2015). Several variants of AIXI have been proposed to attempt to address these shortfalls: among them are entropy-seeking agents (Orseau, 2011), knowledge-seeking agents (Orseau et al., 2013), Bayes with bursts of exploration (Lattimore, 2013), MDL agents (Leike, 2016a), Thompson sampling (Leike et al., 2016), and optimism (Sunehag and Hutter, 2015). We present AIXIjs, a JavaScript implementation of these GRL agents. This implementation is accompanied by a framework for running experiments against various environments, similar to OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al., 2016), and a suite of interactive demos that explore different properties of the agents, similar to REINFORCEjs (Karpathy, 2015). We use AIXIjs to present numerous experiments illustrating fundamental properties of, and differences between, these agents.",0
"Existing value function approximation methods have been successfully used in many applications, but they often lack useful a priori error bounds. We propose a new approximate bilinear programming formulation of value function approximation, which employs global optimization. The formulation provides strong a priori guarantees on both robust and expected policy loss by minimizing specific norms of the Bellman residual. Solving a bilinear program optimally is NP-hard, but this is unavoidable because the Bellman-residual minimization itself is NP-hard. We describe and analyze both optimal and approximate algorithms for solving bilinear programs. The analysis shows that this algorithm offers a convergent generalization of approximate policy iteration. We also briefly analyze the behavior of bilinear programming algorithms under incomplete samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can consistently minimize the Bellman residual on simple benchmark problems.",0
"We introduce Stacked Thompson Bandits (STB) for efficiently generating plans that are likely to satisfy a given bounded temporal logic requirement. STB uses a simulation for evaluation of plans, and takes a Bayesian approach to using the resulting information to guide its search. In particular, we show that stacking multiarmed bandits and using Thompson sampling to guide the action selection process for each bandit enables STB to generate plans that satisfy requirements with a high probability while only searching a fraction of the search space.",0
"Research in the Life Sciences depends on the integration of large, distributed and heterogeneous data sources and web services. The discovery of which of these resources are the most appropriate to solve a given task is a complex research question, since there is a large amount of plausible candidates and there is little, mostly unstructured, metadata to be able to decide among them.We contribute a semi-automatic approach,based on semantic techniques, to assist researchers in the discovery of the most appropriate web services to full a set of given requirements.",0
"We present a framework that allows an observer to determine occluded portions of a structure by finding the maximum-likelihood estimate of those occluded portions consistent with visible image evidence and a consistency model. Doing this requires determining which portions of the structure are occluded in the first place. Since each process relies on the other, we determine a solution to both problems in tandem. We extend our framework to determine confidence of one's assessment of which portions of an observed structure are occluded, and the estimate of that occluded structure, by determining the sensitivity of one's assessment to potential new observations. We further extend our framework to determine a robotic action whose execution would allow a new observation that would maximally increase one's confidence.",0
"This paper presents a plausible reasoning system to illustrate some broad issues in knowledge representation: dualities between different reasoning forms, the difficulty of unifying complementary reasoning styles, and the approximate nature of plausible reasoning. These issues have a common underlying theme: there should be an underlying belief calculus of which the many different reasoning forms are special cases, sometimes approximate. The system presented allows reasoning about defaults, likelihood, necessity and possibility in a manner similar to the earlier work of Adams. The system is based on the belief calculus of subjective Bayesian probability which itself is based on a few simple assumptions about how belief should be manipulated. Approximations, semantics, consistency and consequence results are presented for the system. While this puts these often discussed plausible reasoning forms on a probabilistic footing, useful application to practical problems remains an issue.",0
"We define a logic of propositional formula schemata adding to the syntax of propositional logic indexed propositions and iterated connectives ranging over intervals parameterized by arithmetic variables. The satisfiability problem is shown to be undecidable for this new logic, but we introduce a very general class of schemata, called bound-linear, for which this problem becomes decidable. This result is obtained by reduction to a particular class of schemata called regular, for which we provide a sound and complete terminating proof procedure. This schemata calculus allows one to capture proof patterns corresponding to a large class of problems specified in propositional logic. We also show that the satisfiability problem becomes again undecidable for slight extensions of this class, thus demonstrating that bound-linear schemata represent a good compromise between expressivity and decidability.",0
"In this paper, we present an illustration to the history of Artificial Intelligence(AI) with a statistical analysis of publish since 1940. We collected and mined through the IEEE publish data base to analysis the geological and chronological variance of the activeness of research in AI. The connections between different institutes are showed. The result shows that the leading community of AI research are mainly in the USA, China, the Europe and Japan. The key institutes, authors and the research hotspots are revealed. It is found that the research institutes in the fields like Data Mining, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and some other fields of Machine Learning are quite consistent, implying a strong interaction between the community of each field. It is also showed that the research of Electronic Engineering and Industrial or Commercial applications are very active in California. Japan is also publishing a lot of papers in robotics. Due to the limitation of data source, the result might be overly influenced by the number of published articles, which is to our best improved by applying network keynode analysis on the research community instead of merely count the number of publish.",0
"Much of work in semantic web relying on Wikipedia as the main source of knowledge often work on static snapshots of the dataset. The full history of Wikipedia revisions, while contains much more useful information, is still difficult to access due to its exceptional volume. To enable further research on this collection, we developed a tool, named Hedera, that efficiently extracts semantic information from Wikipedia revision history datasets. Hedera exploits Map-Reduce paradigm to achieve rapid extraction, it is able to handle one entire Wikipedia articles revision history within a day in a medium-scale cluster, and supports flexible data structures for various kinds of semantic web study.",0
"One-class classification (OCC) algorithms aim to build classification models when the negative class is either absent, poorly sampled or not well defined. This unique situation constrains the learning of efficient classifiers by defining class boundary just with the knowledge of positive class. The OCC problem has been considered and applied under many research themes, such as outlier/novelty detection and concept learning. In this paper we present a unified view of the general problem of OCC by presenting a taxonomy of study for OCC problems, which is based on the availability of training data, algorithms used and the application domains applied. We further delve into each of the categories of the proposed taxonomy and present a comprehensive literature review of the OCC algorithms, techniques and methodologies with a focus on their significance, limitations and applications. We conclude our paper by discussing some open research problems in the field of OCC and present our vision for future research.",0
"Currently, criminals profile (CP) is obtained from investigators or forensic psychologists interpretation, linking crime scene characteristics and an offenders behavior to his or her characteristics and psychological profile. This paper seeks an efficient and systematic discovery of nonobvious and valuable patterns between variables from a large database of solved cases via a probabilistic network (PN) modeling approach. The PN structure can be used to extract behavioral patterns and to gain insight into what factors influence these behaviors. Thus, when a new case is being investigated and the profile variables are unknown because the offender has yet to be identified, the observed crime scene variables are used to infer the unknown variables based on their connections in the structure and the corresponding numerical (probabilistic) weights. The objective is to produce a more systematic and empirical approach to profiling, and to use the resulting PN model as a decision tool.",0
"Inference in Bayes Nets (BAYES) is an important problem with numerous applications in probabilistic reasoning. Counting the number of satisfying assignments of a propositional formula (#SAT) is a closely related problem of fundamental theoretical importance. Both these problems, and others, are members of the class of sum-of-products (SUMPROD) problems. In this paper we show that standard backtracking search when augmented with a simple memoization scheme (caching) can solve any sum-of-products problem with time complexity that is at least as good any other state-of-the-art exact algorithm, and that it can also achieve the best known time-space tradeoff. Furthermore, backtracking's ability to utilize more flexible variable orderings allows us to prove that it can achieve an exponential speedup over other standard algorithms for SUMPROD on some instances.",0
"In a recent conference paper, we have reported a rhythm transcription method based on a merged-output hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly describes the multiple-voice structure of polyphonic music. This model solves a major problem of conventional methods that could not properly describe the nature of multiple voices as in polyrhythmic scores or in the phenomenon of loose synchrony between voices. In this paper we present a complete description of the proposed model and develop an inference technique, which is valid for any merged-output HMMs for which output probabilities depend on past events. We also examine the influence of the architecture and parameters of the method in terms of accuracies of rhythm transcription and voice separation and perform comparative evaluations with six other algorithms. Using MIDI recordings of classical piano pieces, we found that the proposed model outperformed other methods by more than 12 points in the accuracy for polyrhythmic performances and performed almost as good as the best one for non-polyrhythmic performances. This reveals the state-of-the-art methods of rhythm transcription for the first time in the literature. Publicly available source codes are also provided for future comparisons.",0
"Artificial intelligence has seen a number of breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as significant milestones. A common feature of games with these successes is that they involve information symmetry among the players, where all players have identical information. This property of perfect information, though, is far more common in games than in real-world problems. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and it has been a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce DeepStack, a new algorithm for imperfect information settings such as poker. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition about arbitrary poker situations that is automatically learned from self-play games using deep learning. In a study involving dozens of participants and 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack becomes the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. Furthermore, we show this approach dramatically reduces worst-case exploitability compared to the abstraction paradigm that has been favored for over a decade.",0
"This paper discusses the semantics of weighted argumentation graphs that are biplor, i.e. contain both attacks and support graphs. The work builds on previous work by Amgoud, Ben-Naim et. al., which presents and compares several semantics for argumentation graphs that contain only supports or only attacks relationships, respectively.",0
This article extends the method of Garriga et al. for mining relevant rules to numerical attributes by extracting interval-based pattern rules. We propose an algorithm that extracts such rules from numerical datasets using the interval-pattern approach from Kaytoue et al. This algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on real datasets.,0
"In the literature of game theory, the information sets of extensive form games have different interpretations, which may lead to confusions and paradoxical cases. We argue that the problem lies in the mix-up of two interpretations of the extensive form game structures: game rules or game runs which do not always coincide. In this paper, we try to separate and connect these two views by proposing a dynamic epistemic framework in which we can compute the runs step by step from the game rules plus the given assumptions of the players. We propose a modal logic to describe players' knowledge and its change during the plays, and provide a complete axiomatization. We also show that, under certain conditions, the mix-up of the rules and the runs is not harmful due to the structural similarity of the two.",0
"Job interview simulation with a virtual agents aims at improving people's social skills and supporting professional inclusion. In such simulators, the virtual agent must be capable of representing and reasoning about the user's mental state based on social cues that inform the system about his/her affects and social attitude. In this paper, we propose a formal model of Theory of Mind (ToM) for virtual agent in the context of human-agent interaction that focuses on the affective dimension. It relies on a hybrid ToM that combines the two major paradigms of the domain. Our framework is based on modal logic and inference rules about the mental states, emotions and social relations of both actors. Finally, we present preliminary results regarding the impact of such a model on natural interaction in the context of job interviews simulation.",0
We propose a new point-based method for approximate planning in Dec-POMDP which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality. It uses a heuristic estimation of the prior probability of beliefs to choose a bounded number of policy trees: this choice is formulated as a combinatorial optimisation problem minimising the error induced by pruning.,0
"Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction, towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.",1
"Robust Bayesian inference is the calculation of posterior probability bounds given perturbations in a probabilistic model. This paper focuses on perturbations that can be expressed locally in Bayesian networks through convex sets of distributions. Two approaches for combination of local models are considered. The first approach takes the largest set of joint distributions that is compatible with the local sets of distributions; we show how to reduce this type of robust inference to a linear programming problem. The second approach takes the convex hull of joint distributions generated from the local sets of distributions; we demonstrate how to apply interior-point optimization methods to generate posterior bounds and how to generate approximations that are guaranteed to converge to correct posterior bounds. We also discuss calculation of bounds for expected utilities and variances, and global perturbation models.",0
"Random embedding has been applied with empirical success to large-scale black-box optimization problems with low effective dimensions. This paper proposes the EmbeddedHunter algorithm, which incorporates the technique in a hierarchical stochastic bandit setting, following the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and breaking away from the multiple-run framework in which random embedding has been conventionally applied similar to stochastic black-box optimization solvers. Our proposition is motivated by the bounded mean variation in the objective value for a low-dimensional point projected randomly into the decision space of Lipschitz-continuous problems. In essence, the EmbeddedHunter algorithm expands optimistically a partitioning tree over a low-dimensional---equal to the effective dimension of the problem---search space based on a bounded number of random embeddings of sampled points from the low-dimensional space. In contrast to the probabilistic theoretical guarantees of multiple-run random-embedding algorithms, the finite-time analysis of the proposed algorithm presents a theoretical upper bound on the regret as a function of the algorithm's number of iterations. Furthermore, numerical experiments were conducted to validate its performance. The results show a clear performance gain over recently proposed random embedding methods for large-scale problems, provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low.",1

"We introduce a novel playlist generation algorithm that focuses on the quality of transitions using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The proposed model assumes that optimal transitions between tracks can be modelled and predicted by internal transitions within music tracks. We introduce modelling sequences of high-level music descriptors using RNNs and discuss an experiment involving different similarity functions, where the sequences are provided by a musical structural analysis algorithm. Qualitative observations show that the proposed approach can effectively model transitions of music tracks in playlists.",0
"In this paper the theory of flexibly-bounded rationality which is an extension to the theory of bounded rationality is revisited. Rational decision making involves using information which is almost always imperfect and incomplete together with some intelligent machine which if it is a human being is inconsistent to make decisions. In bounded rationality, this decision is made irrespective of the fact that the information to be used is incomplete and imperfect and that the human brain is inconsistent and thus this decision that is to be made is taken within the bounds of these limitations. In the theory of flexibly-bounded rationality, advanced information analysis is used, the correlation machine is applied to complete missing information and artificial intelligence is used to make more consistent decisions. Therefore flexibly-bounded rationality expands the bounds within which rationality is exercised. Because human decision making is essentially irrational, this paper proposes the theory of marginalization of irrationality in decision making to deal with the problem of satisficing in the presence of irrationality.",0
"The paper presents an ant colony optimization metaheuristic for collaborative planning. Collaborative planning is used to coordinate individual plans of self-interested decision makers with private information in order to increase the overall benefit of the coalition. The method consists of a new search graph based on encoded solutions. Distributed and private information is integrated via voting mechanisms and via a simple but effective collaborative local search procedure. The approach is applied to a distributed variant of the multi-level lot-sizing problem and evaluated by means of 352 benchmark instances from the literature. The proposed approach clearly outperforms existing approaches on the sets of medium and large sized instances. While the best method in the literature so far achieves an average deviation from the best known non-distributed solutions of 46 percent for the set of the largest instances, for example, the presented approach reduces the average deviation to only 5 percent.",0
"Class-agnostic object tracking is particularly difficult in cluttered environments as target specific discriminative models cannot be learned a priori. Inspired by how the human visual cortex employs spatial attention and separate ""where"" and ""what"" processing pathways to actively suppress irrelevant visual features, this work develops a hierarchical attentive recurrent model for single object tracking in videos. The first layer of attention discards the majority of background by selecting a region containing the object of interest, while the subsequent layers tune in on visual features particular to the tracked object. This framework is fully differentiable and can be trained in a purely data driven fashion by gradient methods. To improve training convergence, we augment the loss function with terms for a number of auxiliary tasks relevant for tracking. Evaluation of the proposed model is performed on two datasets of increasing difficulty: pedestrian tracking on the KTH activity recognition dataset and the KITTI object tracking dataset.",1
"This paper describes the details of Sighthound's fully automated age, gender and emotion recognition system. The backbone of our system consists of several deep convolutional neural networks that are not only computationally inexpensive, but also provide state-of-the-art results on several competitive benchmarks. To power our novel deep networks, we collected large labeled datasets through a semi-supervised pipeline to reduce the annotation effort/time. We tested our system on several public benchmarks and report outstanding results. Our age, gender and emotion recognition models are available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at",0
"In this article, an agent-based negotiation model for negotiation teams that negotiate a deal with an opponent is presented. Agent-based negotiation teams are groups of agents that join together as a single negotiation party because they share an interest that is related to the negotiation process. The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations. An empirical evaluation is also performed to study the impact of the different parameters of the model.",0
"We propose a simple, elegant solution to use a single Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate between multiple languages. Our solution requires no change in the model architecture from our base system but instead introduces an artificial token at the beginning of the input sentence to specify the required target language. The rest of the model, which includes encoder, decoder and attention, remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. Using a shared wordpiece vocabulary, our approach enables Multilingual NMT using a single model without any increase in parameters, which is significantly simpler than previous proposals for Multilingual NMT. Our method often improves the translation quality of all involved language pairs, even while keeping the total number of model parameters constant. On the WMT'14 benchmarks, a single multilingual model achieves comparable performance for English$\rightarrow$French and surpasses state-of-the-art results for English$\rightarrow$German. Similarly, a single multilingual model surpasses state-of-the-art results for French$\rightarrow$English and German$\rightarrow$English on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks respectively. On production corpora, multilingual models of up to twelve language pairs allow for better translation of many individual pairs. In addition to improving the translation quality of language pairs that the model was trained with, our models can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs never seen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zero-shot translation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses that hints at a universal interlingua representation in our models and show some interesting examples when mixing languages.",1
"We study the strategic aspects of social influence in a society of agents linked by a trust network, introducing a new class of games called games of influence. A game of influence is an infinite repeated game with incomplete information in which, at each stage of interaction, an agent can make her opinions visible (public) or invisible (private) in order to influence other agents' opinions. The influence process is mediated by a trust network, as we assume that the opinion of a given agent is only affected by the opinions of those agents that she considers trustworthy (i.e., the agents in the trust network that are directly linked to her). Each agent is endowed with a goal, expressed in a suitable temporal language inspired from linear temporal logic (LTL). We show that games of influence provide a simple abstraction to explore the effects of the trust network structure on the agents' behaviour, by considering solution concepts from game-theory such as Nash equilibrium, weak dominance and winning strategies.",0
"In this paper we present a synthesis of the work performed on two inference algorithms: the Pearl's belief propagation (BP) algorithm applied to Bayesian networks without loops (i.e. polytree) and the Loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm (inspired from the BP) which is applied to networks containing undirected cycles. It is known that the BP algorithm, applied to Bayesian networks with loops, gives incorrect numerical results i.e. incorrect posterior probabilities. Murphy and al. [7] find that the LBP algorithm converges on several networks and when this occurs, LBP gives a good approximation of the exact posterior probabilities. However this algorithm presents an oscillatory behaviour when it is applied to QMR (Quick Medical Reference) network [15]. This phenomenon prevents the LBP algorithm from converging towards a good approximation of posterior probabilities. We believe that the translation of the inference computation problem from the probabilistic framework to the possibilistic framework will allow performance improvement of LBP algorithm. We hope that an adaptation of this algorithm to a possibilistic causal network will show an improvement of the convergence of LBP.",0
"The impossibility theorem of Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini has been thought to demonstrate that standard state-space models cannot be used to represent unawareness. We first show that Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini do not establish this claim. We then distinguish three notions of awareness, and argue that although one of them may not be adequately modeled using standard state spaces, there is no reason to think that standard state spaces cannot provide models of the other two notions. In fact, standard space models of these forms of awareness are attractively simple. They allow us to prove completeness and decidability results with ease, to carry over standard techniques from decision theory, and to add propositional quantifiers straightforwardly.",0
"We study abduction in First Order Horn logic theories where all atoms can be abduced and we are looking for prefered solutions with respect to objective functions cardinality minimality, Coherence, or Weighted Abduction. We represent this reasoning problem in Answer Set Programming (ASP), in order to obtain a flexible framework for experimenting with global constraints and objective functions, and to test the boundaries of what is possible with ASP, because realizing this problem in ASP is challenging as it requires value invention and equivalence between certain constants as the Unique Names Assumption does not hold in general. For permitting reasoning in cyclic theories, we formally describe fine-grained variations of limiting Skolemization. We evaluate our encodings and extensions experimentally on the ACCEL benchmark for plan recognition in Natural Language Understanding. Our encodings are publicly available, modular, and our approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art solvers on the ACCEL benchmark. We identify term equivalence as a main instantiation bottleneck, and experiment with on-demand constraints that were used to eliminate the same bottleneck in state-of-the-art solvers and make them applicable for larger datasets. Surprisingly, experiments show that this method is beneficial only for cardinality minimality with our ASP encodings.",0
"Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is currently a challenge as existing diagnostic criteria rely on neuropsychological examinations. Automated Machine Learning (ML) models that are trained on verbal utterances of MCI patients can aid diagnosis. Using a combination of skip-gram features, our model learned several linguistic biomarkers to distinguish between 19 patients with MCI and 19 healthy control individuals from the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset. Results show that a model with compound of skip-grams has better AUC and could help ML prediction on small MCI data sample.",0
"State-of-the-art answer set programming (ASP) solvers rely on a program called a grounder to convert non-ground programs containing variables into variable-free, propositional programs. The size of this grounding depends heavily on the size of the non-ground rules, and thus, reducing the size of such rules is a promising approach to improve solving performance. To this end, in this paper we announce lpopt, a tool that decomposes large logic programming rules into smaller rules that are easier to handle for current solvers. The tool is specifically tailored to handle the standard syntax of the ASP language (ASP-Core) and makes it easier for users to write efficient and intuitive ASP programs, which would otherwise often require significant hand-tuning by expert ASP engineers. It is based on an idea proposed by Morak and Woltran (2012) that we extend significantly in order to handle the full ASP syntax, including complex constructs like aggregates, weak constraints, and arithmetic expressions. We present the algorithm, the theoretical foundations on how to treat these constructs, as well as an experimental evaluation showing the viability of our approach.",0
"Data science and machine learning are the key technologies when it comes to the processes and products with automatic learning and optimization to be used in the automotive industry of the future.

In addition, it defines the term ""optimizing analytics"" and illustrates the role of automatic optimization as a key technology in combination with data analytics. It also uses examples to explain the way that these technologies are currently being used in the automotive industry on the basis of the major subprocesses in the automotive value chain (development, procurement; logistics, production, marketing, sales and after-sales, connected customer). Since the industry is just starting to explore the broad range of potential uses for these technologies, visionary application examples are used to illustrate the revolutionary possibilities that they offer. Finally, the article demonstrates how these technologies can make the automotive industry more efficient and enhance its customer focus throughout all its operations and activities, extending from the product and its development process to the customers and their connection to the product.",0
"Within the possibilistic approach to uncertainty modeling, the paper presents a modal logical system to reason about qualitative (comparative) statements of the possibility (and necessity) of fuzzy propositions. We relate this qualitative modal logic to the many--valued analogues MVS5 and MVKD45 of the well known modal logics of knowledge and belief S5 and KD45 respectively. Completeness results are obtained for such logics and therefore, they extend previous existing results for qualitative possibilistic logics in the classical non-fuzzy setting.",0

"In this paper, we present MidiNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based generative adversarial network (GAN) that is intended to provide a general, highly adaptive network structure for symbolic-domain music generation. The network takes random noise as input and generates a melody sequence one mea- sure (bar) after another. Moreover, it has a novel reflective CNN sub-model that allows us to guide the generation process by providing not only 1D but also 2D conditions. In our implementation, we used the intended chord of the current bar as a 1D condition to provide a harmonic context, and the melody generated for the preceding bar previously as a 2D condition to provide sequential information. The output of the network is a 16 by 128 matrix each time, representing the presence of each of the 128 MIDI notes in the generated melody sequence of that bar, with the smallest temporal unit being the sixteenth note. MidiNet can generate music of arbitrary number of bars, by concatenating these 16 by 128 matrices. The melody sequence can then be played back with a synthesizer. We provide example clips showing the effectiveness of MidiNet in generating harmonic music.",0
"Recommendation algorithms that incorporate techniques from deep learning are becoming increasingly popular. Due to the structure of the data coming from recommendation domains (i.e., one-hot-encoded vectors of item preferences), these algorithms tend to have large input and output dimensionalities that dominate their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, we propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances. Bloom embeddings are computationally efficient, and do not seriously compromise the accuracy of the model up to 1/5 compression ratios. In some cases, they even improve over the original accuracy, with relative increases up to 12%. We evaluate Bloom embeddings on 7 data sets and compare it against 4 alternative methods, obtaining favorable results. We also discuss a number of further advantages of Bloom embeddings, such as 'on-the-fly' constant-time operation, zero or marginal space requirements, training time speedups, or the fact that they do not require any change to the core model architecture or training configuration.",0
"We consider the problem belief-state monitoring for the purposes of implementing a policy for a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP), specifically how one might approximate the belief state. Other schemes for belief-state approximation (e.g., based on minimixing a measures such as KL-diveregence between the true and estimated state) are not necessarily appropriate for POMDPs. Instead we propose a framework for analyzing value-directed approximation schemes, where approximation quality is determined by the expected error in utility rather than by the error in the belief state itself. We propose heuristic methods for finding good projection schemes for belief state estimation - exhibiting anytime characteristics - given a POMDP value fucntion. We also describe several algorithms for constructing bounds on the error in decision quality (expected utility) associated with acting in accordance with a given belief state approximation.",0
"In recent years ontologies enjoyed a growing popularity outside specialized AI communities. System engineering is no exception to this trend, with ontologies being proposed as a basis for several tasks in complex industrial implements, including system design, monitoring and diagnosis. In this paper, we consider four different contributions to system engineering wherein ontologies are instrumental to provide enhancements over traditional ad-hoc techniques. For each application, we briefly report the methodologies, the tools and the results obtained with the goal to provide an assessment of merits and limits of ontologies in such domains.",0
"We study the skip-thought model with neighborhood information as weak supervision. More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn't aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.",0
"Markov decision problems (MDPs) provide the foundations for a number of problems of interest to AI researchers studying automated planning and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we summarize results regarding the complexity of solving MDPs and the running time of MDP solution algorithms. We argue that, although MDPs can be solved efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical algorithms for solving large problems quickly. To encourage future research, we sketch some alternative methods of analysis that rely on the structure of MDPs.",0
"In this paper we present refinement modal logic. A refinement is like a bisimulation, except that from the three relational requirements only 'atoms' and 'back' need to be satisfied. Our logic contains a new operator 'forall' in additional to the standard modalities 'Box' for each agent. The operator 'forall' acts as a quantifier over the set of all refinements of a given model. We call it the refinement operator. As a variation on a bisimulation quantifier, it can be seen as a refinement quantifier over a variable not occurring in the formula bound by the operator. The logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal logic with some powers of monadic second order quantification. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of multiagent refinement modal logic. We also present an extension of the logic to the modal mu-calculus, and an axiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and applications are also discussed: to software verification and design (the set of agents can also be seen as a set of actions), and to dynamic epistemic logic. We further give detailed results on the complexity of satisfiability, and on succinctness.",0
"This paper describes a simple new semantics for logic rules, the founded semantics, and its straightforward extension to another simple new semantics, the constraint semantics. The new semantics support unrestricted negation, as well as unrestricted existential and universal quantifications. They are uniquely expressive and intuitive by allowing assumptions about the predicates and rules to be specified explicitly, are completely declarative and easy to understand, and relate cleanly to prior semantics. In addition, founded semantics can be computed in linear time in the size of the ground program.",0
"Type-1 fuzzy logic has frequently been used in control systems. However this method is sometimes shown to be too restrictive and unable to adapt in the presence of uncertainty. In this paper we compare type-1 fuzzy control with several other fuzzy approaches under a range of uncertain conditions. Interval type-2 and non-stationary fuzzy controllers are compared, along with 'dual surface' type-2 control, named due to utilising both the lower and upper values produced from standard interval type-2 systems. We tune a type-1 controller, then derive the membership functions and footprints of uncertainty from the type-1 system and evaluate them using a simulated autonomous sailing problem with varying amounts of environmental uncertainty. We show that while these more sophisticated controllers can produce better performance than the type-1 controller, this is not guaranteed and that selection of Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) size has a large effect on this relative performance.",0
"We develop a Bayesian model for decision-making under time pressure with endogenous information acquisition. In our model, the decision maker decides when to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuous-time stochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential occurrence or non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the decision-making process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the adverse event, the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to acquire information from the time series (continuation), and when to stop acquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the optimal policy has a rendezvous structure, i.e. a structure in which whenever a new information sample is gathered from the time series, the optimal ""date"" for acquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two information samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker's surprise, i.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information, and suspense, i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time interval between two information samples. Moreover, we characterize the continuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker's state-space, and show that they depend not only on the decision-maker's beliefs, but also on the context, i.e. the current realization of the time series.",1
"Creating any aesthetically pleasing piece of art, like music, has been a long time dream for artificial intelligence research. Based on recent success of long-short term memory (LSTM) on sequence learning, we put forward a novel system to reflect the thinking pattern of a musician. For data representation, we propose a note-level encoding method, which enables our model to simulate how human composes and polishes music phrases. To avoid failure against music theory, we invent a novel method, grammar argumented (GA) method. It can teach machine basic composing principles. In this method, we propose three rules as argumented grammars and three metrics for evaluation of machine-made music. Results show that comparing to basic LSTM, grammar argumented model's compositions have higher contents of diatonic scale notes, short pitch intervals, and chords.",0
"There is much interest in using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) as a formal model for planning in stochastic domains. This paper is concerned with finding optimal policies for POMDPs. We propose several improvements to incremental pruning, presently the most efficient exact algorithm for solving POMDPs.",0
"The deployment of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in safety-critical applications poses a number of new verification and certification challenges. In particular, for ANN-enabled self-driving vehicles it is important to establish properties about the resilience of ANNs to noisy or even maliciously manipulated sensory input. We are addressing these challenges by defining resilience properties of ANN-based classifiers as the maximal amount of input or sensor perturbation which is still tolerated. This problem of computing maximal perturbation bounds for ANNs is then reduced to solving mixed integer optimization problems (MIP). A number of MIP encoding heuristics are developed for drastically reducing MIP-solver runtimes, and using parallelization of MIP-solvers results in an almost linear speed-up in the number (up to a certain limit) of computing cores in our experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach by means of computing maximal resilience bounds for a number of ANN benchmark sets ranging from typical image recognition scenarios to the autonomous maneuvering of robots.",0
"We exploit qualitative probabilistic relationships among variables for computing bounds of conditional probability distributions of interest in Bayesian networks. Using the signs of qualitative relationships, we can implement abstraction operations that are guaranteed to bound the distributions of interest in the desired direction. By evaluating incrementally improved approximate networks, our algorithm obtains monotonically tightening bounds that converge to exact distributions. For supermodular utility functions, the tightening bounds monotonically reduce the set of admissible decision alternatives as well.",0
"Improving the throughput of molecular docking, a computationally intensive phase of the virtual screening process, is a highly sought area of research since it has a significant weight in the drug designing process. With such improvements, the world might find cures for incurable diseases like HIV disease and Cancer sooner. Our approach presented in this paper is to utilize a multi-core environment to introduce Data Level Parallelism (DLP) to the Autodock Vina software, which is a widely used for molecular docking software. Autodock Vina already exploits Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) in multi-core environments and therefore optimized for such environments. However, with the results we have obtained, it can be clearly seen that our approach has enhanced the throughput of the already optimized software by more than six times. This will dramatically reduce the time consumed for the lead identification phase in drug designing along with the shift in the processor technology from multi-core to many-core of the current era. Therefore, we believe that the contribution of this project will effectively make it possible to expand the number of small molecules docked against a drug target and improving the chances to design drugs for incurable diseases.",0
"Training robots to perceive, act and communicate using multiple modalities still represents a challenging problem, particularly if robots are expected to learn efficiently from small sets of example interactions. We describe a learning approach as a step in this direction, where we teach a humanoid robot how to play the game of noughts and crosses. Given that multiple multimodal skills can be trained to play this game, we focus our attention to training the robot to perceive the game, and to interact in this game. Our multimodal deep reinforcement learning agent perceives multimodal features and exhibits verbal and non-verbal actions while playing. Experimental results using simulations show that the robot can learn to win or draw up to 98% of the games. A pilot test of the proposed multimodal system for the targeted game---integrating speech, vision and gestures---reports that reasonable and fluent interactions can be achieved using the proposed approach.",0
"An increasing amount of information is generated from the rapidly increasing number of sensor networks and smart devices. A wide variety of sources generate and publish information in different formats, thus highlighting interoperability as one of the key prerequisites for the success of Internet of Things (IoT). The BT Hypercat Data Hub provides a focal point for the sharing and consumption of available datasets from a wide range of sources. In this work, we propose a semantic enrichment of the BT Hypercat Data Hub, using well-accepted Semantic Web standards and tools. We propose an ontology that captures the semantics of the imported data and present the BT SPARQL Endpoint by means of a mapping between SPARQL and SQL queries. Furthermore, federated SPARQL queries allow queries over multiple hub-based and external data sources. Finally, we provide two use cases in order to illustrate the advantages afforded by our semantic approach.",0
"This paper investigates multi-agent frequencybased patrolling of intersecting, circle graphs under conditions where graph nodes have non-uniform visitation requirements and agents have limited ability to communicate. The task is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process, and a reinforcement learning solution is developed. Each agent generates its own policy from Markov chains, and policies are exchanged only when agents occupy the same or adjacent nodes. This constraint on policy exchange models sparse communication conditions over large, unstructured environments. Empirical results provide perspectives on convergence properties, agent cooperation, and generalization of learned patrolling policies to new instances of the task. The emergent behavior indicates learned coordination strategies between heterogeneous agents for patrolling large, unstructured regions as well as the ability to generalize to dynamic variation in node visitation requirements.",0
"This paper recalls the definition of consistency for pairwise comparison matrices and briefly presents the concept of inconsistency index in connection to other aspects of the theory of pairwise comparisons. By commenting on a recent contribution by Koczkodaj and Szwarc, it will be shown that the discussion on inconsistency indices is far from being over, and the ground is still fertile for debates.",0
"Model-based diagnostic reasoning often leads to a large number of diagnostic hypotheses. The set of diagnoses can be reduced by taking into account extra observations (passive monitoring), measuring additional variables (probing) or executing additional tests (sequential diagnosis/test sequencing). In this paper we combine the above approaches with techniques from Automated Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) and Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) into a framework called FRACTAL (FRamework for ACtive Testing ALgorithms). Apart from the inputs and outputs that connect a system to its environment, in active testing we consider additional input variables to which a sequence of test vectors can be supplied. We address the computationally hard problem of computing optimal control assignments (as defined in FRACTAL) in terms of a greedy approximation algorithm called FRACTAL-G. We compare the decrease in the number of remaining minimal cardinality diagnoses of FRACTAL-G to that of two more FRACTAL algorithms: FRACTAL-ATPG and FRACTAL-P. FRACTAL-ATPG is based on ATPG and sequential diagnosis while FRACTAL-P is based on probing and, although not an active testing algorithm, provides a baseline for comparing the lower bound on the number of reachable diagnoses for the FRACTAL algorithms. We empirically evaluate the trade-offs of the three FRACTAL algorithms by performing extensive experimentation on the ISCAS85/74XXX benchmark of combinational circuits.",0
"When writing a constraint program, we have to choose which variables should be the decision variables, and how to represent the constraints on these variables. In many cases, there is considerable choice for the decision variables. Consider, for example, permutation problems in which we have as many values as variables, and each variable takes an unique value. In such problems, we can choose between a primal and a dual viewpoint. In the dual viewpoint, each dual variable represents one of the primal values, whilst each dual value represents one of the primal variables. Alternatively, by means of channelling constraints to link the primal and dual variables, we can have a combined model with both sets of variables. In this paper, we perform an extensive theoretical and empirical study of such primal, dual and combined models for two classes of problems: permutation problems and injection problems. Our results show that it often be advantageous to use multiple viewpoints, and to have constraints which channel between them to maintain consistency. They also illustrate a general methodology for comparing different constraint models.",0
"The development of new methods and representations for temporal decision-making requires a principled basis for characterizing and measuring the flexibility of decision strategies in the face of uncertainty. Our goal in this paper is to provide a framework - not a theory - for observing how decision policies behave in the face of informational perturbations, to gain clues as to how they might behave in the face of unanticipated, possibly unarticulated uncertainties. To this end, we find it beneficial to distinguish between two types of uncertainty: ""Small World"" and ""Large World"" uncertainty. The first type can be resolved by posing an unambiguous question to a ""clairvoyant,"" and is anchored on some well-defined aspect of a decision frame. The second type is more troublesome, yet it is often of greater interest when we address the issue of flexibility; this type of uncertainty can be resolved only by consulting a ""psychic."" We next observe that one approach to flexibility used in the economics literature is already implicitly accounted for in the Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) principle from decision theory. Though simple, the observation establishes the context for a more illuminating notion of flexibility, what we term flexibility with respect to information revelation. We show how to perform flexibility analysis of a static (i.e., single period) decision problem using a simple example, and we observe that the most flexible alternative thus identified is not necessarily the MEU alternative. We extend our analysis for a dynamic (i.e., multi-period) model, and we demonstrate how to calculate the value of flexibility for decision strategies that allow downstream revision of an upstream commitment decision.",0
"Penetration Testing is a methodology for assessing network security, by generating and executing possible hacking attacks. Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question is how to generate the attacks. This is naturally formulated as planning under uncertainty, i.e., under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.",0
The Generational Garbage collection involves organizing the heap into different divisions of memory space in-order to filter long-lived objects from short-lived objects through moving the surviving object of each generation Garbage Collection cycle to another memory space updating its age and reclaiming space from the dead ones. The problem in this method is that the longer an object is alive during its initial generations the longer the garbage collector will have to deal with it by checking for its reachability from the root and promoting it to other space divisions where as the ultimate goal of the Garbage Collector is to reclaim memory from unreachable objects at a minimal time possible. This paper is a proposal of a method where the lifetime of every object getting into the heap will be predicted and will be placed in heap accordingly for the garbage collector to deal more with reclaiming space from dead objects and less in promoting the live ones to the higher level.,0
"In this paper, we present a transfer learning approach for music classification and regression tasks. We propose to use a pretrained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show that how this convnet feature can serve as a general-purpose music representation. In the experiment, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred for many music-related classification and regression tasks as well as an audio-related classification task. In experiments, the convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all tasks and many reported approaches of aggregating MFCCs and low- and high-level music features.",0
"The search for patterns or motifs in data represents a problem area of key interest to finance and economic researchers. In this paper we introduce the Motif Tracking Algorithm, a novel immune inspired pattern identification tool that is able to identify unknown motifs of a non specified length which repeat within time series data. The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it uses a small number of parameters with minimal assumptions regarding the data being examined or the underlying motifs. Our interest lies in applying the algorithm to financial time series data to identify unknown patterns that exist. The algorithm is tested using three separate data sets. Particular suitability to financial data is shown by applying it to oil price data. In all cases the algorithm identifies the presence of a motif population in a fast and efficient manner due to the utilisation of an intuitive symbolic representation. The resulting population of motifs is shown to have considerable potential value for other applications such as forecasting and algorithm seeding.",0
"Pairwise comparisons are a well-known method for the representation of the subjective preferences of a decision maker. Evaluating their inconsistency has been a widely studied and discussed topic and several indices have been proposed in the literature to perform this task. Since an acceptable level of consistency is closely related with the reliability of preferences, a suitable choice of an inconsistency index is a crucial phase in decision making processes. The use of different methods for measuring consistency must be carefully evaluated, as it can affect the decision outcome in practical applications. In this paper, we present five axioms aimed at characterizing inconsistency indices. In addition, we prove that some of the indices proposed in the literature satisfy these axioms, while others do not, and therefore, in our view, they may fail to correctly evaluate inconsistency.",0
"Building models that take advantage of the hierarchical structure of language without a priori annotation is a longstanding goal in natural language processing. We introduce such a model for the task of machine translation, pairing a recurrent neural network grammar encoder with a novel attentional RNNG decoder and applying policy gradient reinforcement learning to induce unsupervised tree structures on both the source and target. When trained on character-level datasets with no explicit segmentation or parse annotation, the model learns a plausible segmentation and shallow parse, obtaining performance close to an attentional baseline.",0
"We present an anytime algorithm which computes policies for decision problems represented as multi-stage influence diagrams. Our algorithm constructs policies incrementally, starting from a policy which makes no use of the available information. The incremental process constructs policies which includes more of the information available to the decision maker at each step. While the process converges to the optimal policy, our approach is designed for situations in which computing the optimal policy is infeasible. We provide examples of the process on several large decision problems, showing that, for these examples, the process constructs valuable (but sub-optimal) policies before the optimal policy would be available by traditional methods.",0
"In this paper we extend the classical notion of strong and weak backdoor sets by allowing that different instantiations of the backdoor variables result in instances that belong to different base classes; the union of the base classes forms a heterogeneous base class. Backdoor sets to heterogeneous base classes can be much smaller than backdoor sets to homogeneous ones, hence they are much more desirable but possibly harder to find. We draw a detailed complexity landscape for the problem of detecting strong and weak backdoor sets into heterogeneous base classes for SAT and CSP.",1
"Policy evaluation is a crucial step in many reinforcement-learning procedures, which estimates a value function that predicts states' long-term value under a given policy. In this paper, we focus on policy evaluation with linear function approximation over a fixed dataset. We first transform the empirical policy evaluation problem into a (quadratic) convex-concave saddle point problem, and then present a primal-dual batch gradient method, as well as two stochastic variance reduction methods for solving the problem. These algorithms scale linearly in both sample size and feature dimension. Moreover, they achieve linear convergence even when the saddle-point problem has only strong concavity in the dual variables but no strong convexity in the primal variables. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.",1
"The way experts manage uncertainty usually changes depending on the task they are performing. This fact has lead us to consider the problem of communicating modules (task implementations) in a large and structured knowledge based system when modules have different uncertainty calculi. In this paper, the analysis of the communication problem is made assuming that (i) each uncertainty calculus is an inference mechanism defining an entailment relation, and therefore the communication is considered to be inference-preserving, and (ii) we restrict ourselves to the case which the different uncertainty calculi are given by a class of truth functional Multiple-valued Logics.",0
"The validation of any database mining methodology goes through an evaluation process where benchmarks availability is essential. In this paper, we aim to randomly generate relational database benchmarks that allow to check probabilistic dependencies among the attributes. We are particularly interested in Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), which extend Bayesian Networks (BNs) to a relational data mining context and enable effective and robust reasoning over relational data. Even though a panoply of works have focused, separately , on the generation of random Bayesian networks and relational databases, no work has been identified for PRMs on that track. This paper provides an algorithmic approach for generating random PRMs from scratch to fill this gap. The proposed method allows to generate PRMs as well as synthetic relational data from a randomly generated relational schema and a random set of probabilistic dependencies. This can be of interest not only for machine learning researchers to evaluate their proposals in a common framework, but also for databases designers to evaluate the effectiveness of the components of a database management system.",0
"We show how, under certain conditions, the asymptotic behaviour of an Ordinary Differential Equation under non-constant interventions can be modelled using Dynamic Structural Causal Models. In contrast to earlier work, we study not only the effect of interventions on equilibrium states; rather, we model asymptotic behaviour that is dynamic under interventions that vary in time, and include as a special case the study of static equilibria.",0
"We give an interpretation of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) Principle in game-theoretic terms. Based on this interpretation, we make a formal distinction between different ways of {em applying/} Maximum Entropy distributions. MaxEnt has frequently been criticized on the grounds that it leads to highly representation dependent results. Our distinction allows us to avoid this problem in many cases.",0
"Semi-supervised learning plays an important role in large-scale machine learning. Properly using additional unlabeled data (largely available nowadays) often can improve the machine learning accuracy. However, if the machine learning model is misspecified for the underlying true data distribution, the model performance could be seriously jeopardized. This issue is known as model misspecification. To address this issue, we focus on generative models and propose a criterion to detect the onset of model misspecification by measuring the performance difference between models obtained using supervised and semi-supervised learning. Then, we propose to automatically modify the generative models during model training to achieve an unbiased generative model. Rigorous experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed method using two image classification data sets PASCAL VOC'07 and MIR Flickr. Our proposed method has been demonstrated to outperform a number of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches for the classification task.",0
"We examine Bayesian methods for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. In particular, we unify the approaches we presented at last year's conference for discrete and Gaussian domains. We derive a general Bayesian scoring metric, appropriate for both domains. We then use this metric in combination with well-known statistical facts about the Dirichlet and normal--Wishart distributions to derive our metrics for discrete and Gaussian domains.",0
"In practical situations, interval-valued fuzzy sets are frequently encountered. In this paper, firstly, we present shadowed sets for interpreting and understanding interval fuzzy sets. We also provide an analytic solution to computing the pair of thresholds by searching for a balance of uncertainty in the framework of shadowed sets. Secondly, we construct errors-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. We also provide an alternative decision-theoretic formulation for calculating the pair of thresholds by transforming interval-valued loss functions into single-valued loss functions, in which the required thresholds are computed by minimizing decision costs. Thirdly, we compute errors-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate that how to take an action for an object with interval-valued membership grade by using interval-valued loss functions.",0
"Given a point cloud, we consider inferring kinematic models of 3D articulated objects such as boxes for the purpose of manipulating them. While previous work has shown how to extract a planar kinematic model (often represented as a linear chain), such planar models do not apply to 3D objects that are composed of segments often linked to the other segments in cyclic configurations. We present an approach for building a model that captures the relation between the input point cloud features and the object segment as well as the relation between the neighboring object segments. We use a conditional random field that allows us to model the dependencies between different segments of the object. We test our approach on inferring the kinematic structure from partial and noisy point cloud data for a wide variety of boxes including cake boxes, pizza boxes, and cardboard cartons of several sizes. The inferred structure enables our robot to successfully close these boxes by manipulating the flaps.",0
"We investigate two context-dependent clustering techniques for content recommendation based on exploration-exploitation strategies in contextual multi-armed bandit settings. Our algorithms dynamically group users based on the items under consideration and, possibly, group items based on the similarity of the clusterings induced over the users. The resulting algorithm thus takes advantage of preference patterns in the data in a way akin to collaborative filtering methods. We provide an empirical analysis on extensive real-world datasets, showing scalability and increased prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for clustering bandits. For one of the two algorithms we also give a regret analysis within a standard linear stochastic noise setting.",1
"We describe a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the marginal distribution of discrete probabilistic programs. This algorithm takes a functional interpreter for an arbitrary probabilistic programming language and turns it into an efficient marginalizer. Because direct caching of sub-distributions is impossible in the presence of recursion, we build a graph of dependencies between sub-distributions. This factored sum-product network makes (potentially cyclic) dependencies between subproblems explicit, and corresponds to a system of equations for the marginal distribution. We solve these equations by fixed-point iteration in topological order. We illustrate this algorithm on examples used in teaching probabilistic models, computational cognitive science research, and game theory.",0
"The sparse, hierarchical, and modular processing of natural signals is related to the ability of humans to recognize objects with high accuracy. In this study, we report a sparse feature processing and encoding method, which improved the recognition performance of an automated object recognition system. Randomly distributed localized gradient enhanced features were selected before employing aggregate functions for representation, where we used a modular and hierarchical approach to detect the object features. These object features were combined with a minimum distance classifier, thereby obtaining object recognition system accuracies of 93% using the Amsterdam library of object images (ALOI) database, 92% using the Columbia object image library (COIL)-100 database, and 69% using the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database. The object recognition performance was shown to be robust to variations in noise, object scaling, and object shifts. Finally, a comparison with eight existing object recognition methods indicated that our new method improved the recognition accuracy by 10% with ALOI, 8% with the COIL-100 database, and 10% with the PASCAL visual object challenge 2007 database.",0
"Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships are useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform link prediction, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task.",1
"Supply chain formation is the process of determining the structure and terms of exchange relationships to enable a multilevel, multiagent production activity. We present a simple model of supply chains, highlighting two characteristic features: hierarchical subtask decomposition, and resource contention. To decentralize the formation process, we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain. In a competitive equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. To determine prices, we define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies. In the presence of resource contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However, complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs. A subsequent decommitment phase recovers a significant fraction of the lost surplus.",0
"A logical theory of regular double or multiple recurrence of eventualities, which are regular patterns of occurrences that are repeated, in time, has been developed within the context of temporal reasoning that enabled reasoning about the problem of coincidence. i.e. if two complex eventualities, or eventuality sequences consisting respectively of component eventualities x0, x1,....,xr and y0, y1, ..,ys both recur over an interval k and all eventualities are of fixed durations, is there a subinterval of k over which the occurrence xp and yq for p between 1 and r and q between 1 and s coincide. We present the ideas behind a new algorithm for detecting the coincidence of eventualities xp and yq within a cycle of the double recurrence of x and y. The algorithm is based on the novel concept of gcd partitions that requires the partitioning of each of the incidences of both x and y into eventuality sequences each of which components have a duration that is equal to the greatest common divisor of the durations of x and y. The worst case running time of the partitioning algorithm is linear in the maximum of the duration of x and that of y, while the worst case running time of an algorithm exploring a complete cycle is quadratic in the durations of x and y. Hence the partitioning algorithm works faster than the cyclical exploration in the worst case.",0
"I propose a framework for an agent to change its probabilistic beliefs when a new piece of propositional information $\alpha$ is observed. Traditionally, belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process, depending on whether the agent is informed with $\alpha$ in a static world or, respectively, whether $\alpha$ is a 'signal' from the environment due to an event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief change, which ""combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change."" In this paper, I propose a unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent's beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the approach are worked out.",0
"In this paper we provide a concise report on the complexity of the causal ordering problem, originally introduced by Simon to reason about causal relations implicit in mathematical models. We show that Simon's classical algorithm to infer causal ordering is NP-Hard---an intractability previously guessed by Nayak but not yet proven. We present then a detailed account based on Nayak's suggested algorithmic solution (the best available), which is dominated by computing transitive closure---bounded in time by $O(|\mathcal S|^3)$, where $\mathcal S(\mathcal E, \mathcal V)$ is the input system structure composed of a set $\mathcal E$ of equations over a set $\mathcal V$ of variables with density $|\mathcal S|$. We also comment on the potential of causal ordering for emerging applications in large-scale hypothesis management and predictive analytics.",0
We propose here a methodology to help to understand the shortcomings of public transportation in a city via the mining of complex networks representing the supply and demand of public transport. We show how to build these networks based upon data on smart card use in buses via the application of algorithms that estimate an OD and reconstruct the complete itinerary of the passengers. The overlapping of the two networks sheds light in potential overload and waste in the offer of resources that can be mitigated with strategies for balancing supply and demand.,0
"Alignment-free sequence analysis approaches provide important alternatives over multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in biological sequence analysis because alignment-free approaches have low computation complexity and are not dependent on high level of sequence identity, however, most of the existing alignment-free methods do not employ true full information content of sequences and thus can not accurately reveal similarities and differences among DNA sequences. We present a novel alignment-free computational method for sequence analysis based on Ramanujan-Fourier transform (RFT), in which complete information of DNA sequences is retained. We represent DNA sequences as four binary indicator sequences and apply RFT on the indicator sequences to convert them into frequency domain. The Euclidean distance of the complete RFT coefficients of DNA sequences are used as similarity measure. To address the different lengths in Euclidean space of RFT coefficients, we pad zeros to short DNA binary sequences so that the binary sequences equal the longest length in the comparison sequence data. Thus, the DNA sequences are compared in the same dimensional frequency space without information loss. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by presenting experimental results on hierarchical clustering of genes and genomes. The proposed method opens a new channel to biological sequence analysis, classification, and structural module identification.",0
"We consider a non-stationary formulation of the stochastic multi-armed bandit where the rewards are no longer assumed to be identically distributed. For the best-arm identification task, we introduce a version of Successive Elimination based on random shuffling of the $K$ arms. We prove that under a novel and mild assumption on the mean gap $\Delta$, this simple but powerful modification achieves the same guarantees in term of sample complexity and cumulative regret than its original version, but in a much wider class of problems, as it is not anymore constrained to stationary distributions. We also show that the original {\sc Successive Elimination} fails to have controlled regret in this more general scenario, thus showing the benefit of shuffling. We then remove our mild assumption and adapt the algorithm to the best-arm identification task with switching arms. We adapt the definition of the sample complexity for that case and prove that, against an optimal policy with $N-1$ switches of the optimal arm, this new algorithm achieves an expected sample complexity of $O(\Delta^{-2}\sqrt{NK\delta^{-1} \log(K \delta^{-1})})$, where $\delta$ is the probability of failure of the algorithm, and an expected cumulative regret of $O(\Delta^{-1}{\sqrt{NTK \log (TK)}})$ after $T$ time steps.",0
"Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are learning methods for pattern recognition. The probabilistic HMMs have been one of the most used techniques based on the Bayesian model. First-order probabilistic HMMs were adapted to the theory of belief functions such that Bayesian probabilities were replaced with mass functions. In this paper, we present a second-order Hidden Markov Model using belief functions. Previous works in belief HMMs have been focused on the first-order HMMs. We extend them to the second-order model.",0
"We present an algorithm that identifies the reasoning patterns of agents in a game, by iteratively examining the graph structure of its Multi-Agent Influence Diagram (MAID) representation. If the decision of an agent participates in no reasoning patterns, then we can effectively ignore that decision for the purpose of calculating a Nash equilibrium for the game. In some cases, this can lead to exponential time savings in the process of equilibrium calculation. Moreover, our algorithm can be used to enumerate the reasoning patterns in a game, which can be useful for constructing more effective computerized agents interacting with humans.",0
"Identity verification based on authenticity assessment of a handwritten signature is an important issue in biometrics. There are many effective methods for signature verification taking into account dynamics of a signing process. Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature. Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa). In the test of the proposed method two databases were used: public MCYT-100 and paid BioSecure.",0
"Pairwise comparisons are an important tool of modern (multiple criteria) decision making. Since human judgments are often inconsistent, many studies focused on the ways how to express and measure this inconsistency, and several inconsistency indices were proposed as an alternative to Saaty inconsistency index and inconsistency ratio for reciprocal pairwise comparisons matrices. This paper aims to: firstly, introduce a new measure of inconsistency of pairwise comparisons and to prove its basic properties; secondly, to postulate an additional axiom, an upper boundary axiom, to an existing set of axioms; and the last, but not least, the paper provides proofs of satisfaction of this additional axiom by selected inconsistency indices as well as it provides their numerical comparison.",0
"Public debates are a common platform for presenting and juxtaposing diverging views on important issues. In this work we propose a methodology for tracking how ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach in a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner is determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends on aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to make better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively pursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the course of the conversation.",1
Generative model has been one of the most common approaches for solving the Dialog State Tracking Problem with the capabilities to model the dialog hypotheses in an explicit manner. The most important task in such Bayesian networks models is constructing the most reliable user models by learning and reflecting the training data into the probability distribution of user actions conditional on networks states. This paper provides an overall picture of the learning process in a Bayesian framework with an emphasize on the state-of-the-art theoretical analyses of the Expectation Maximization learning algorithm.,0
"In this paper we propose a novel model for unconditional audio generation based on generating one audio sample at a time. We show that our model, which profits from combining memory-less modules, namely autoregressive multilayer perceptrons, and stateful recurrent neural networks in a hierarchical structure is able to capture underlying sources of variations in the temporal sequences over very long time spans, on three datasets of different nature. Human evaluation on the generated samples indicate that our model is preferred over competing models. We also show how each component of the model contributes to the exhibited performance.",1
"A famous biologically inspired hierarchical model firstly proposed by Riesenhuber and Poggio has been successfully applied to multiple visual recognition tasks. The model is able to achieve a set of position- and scale-tolerant recognition, which is a central problem in pattern recognition. In this paper, based on some other biological experimental results, we introduce the Memory and Association Mechanisms into the above biologically inspired model. The main motivations of the work are (a) to mimic the active memory and association mechanism and add the 'top down' adjustment to the above biologically inspired hierarchical model and (b) to build up an algorithm which can save the space and keep a good recognition performance. The new model is also applied to object recognition processes. The primary experimental results show that our method is efficient with much less memory requirement.",0
"Human Motion Analysis (HMA) is currently one of the most popularly active research domains as such significant research interests are motivated by a number of real world applications such as video surveillance, sports analysis, healthcare monitoring and so on. However, most of these real world applications face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA.",0
"The problem of organizing information for multidocument summarization so that the generated summary is coherent has received relatively little attention. While sentence ordering for single document summarization can be determined from the ordering of sentences in the input article, this is not the case for multidocument summarization where summary sentences may be drawn from different input articles. In this paper, we propose a methodology for studying the properties of ordering information in the news genre and describe experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we developed for the task. Based on these experiments, we implemented a strategy for ordering information that combines constraints from chronological order of events and topical relatedness. Evaluation of our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the ordering over two baseline strategies.",0
"Selling reserved instances (or virtual machines) is a basic service in cloud computing. In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for instance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and number of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can only choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we design randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social welfare and providers' revenue.",1
"We propose a purely extensional semantics for higher-order logic programming. In this semantics program predicates denote sets of ordered tuples, and two predicates are equal iff they are equal as sets. Moreover, every program has a unique minimum Herbrand model which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand models of the program and the least fixed-point of an immediate consequence operator. We also propose an SLD-resolution proof procedure which is proven sound and complete with respect to the minimum model semantics. In other words, we provide a purely extensional theoretical framework for higher-order logic programming which generalizes the familiar theory of classical (first-order) logic programming.",0
"We quantify a source of ineffectual computations when processing the multiplications of the convolutional layers in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and propose Pragmatic (PRA), an architecture that exploits it improving performance and energy efficiency. The source of these ineffectual computations is best understood in the context of conventional multipliers which generate internally multiple terms, that is, products of the multiplicand and powers of two, which added together produce the final product [1]. At runtime, many of these terms are zero as they are generated when the multiplicand is combined with the zero-bits of the multiplicator. While conventional bit-parallel multipliers calculate all terms in parallel to reduce individual product latency, PRA calculates only the non-zero terms using a) on-the-fly conversion of the multiplicator representation into an explicit list of powers of two, and b) hybrid bit-parallel multplicand/bit-serial multiplicator processing units. PRA exploits two sources of ineffectual computations: 1) the aforementioned zero product terms which are the result of the lack of explicitness in the multiplicator representation, and 2) the excess in the representation precision used for both multiplicants and multiplicators, e.g., [2]. Measurements demonstrate that for the convolutional layers, a straightforward variant of PRA improves performance by 2.6x over the DaDiaNao (DaDN) accelerator [3] and by 1.4x over STR [4]. Similarly, PRA improves energy efficiency by 28% and 10% on average compared to DaDN and STR. An improved cross lane synchronication scheme boosts performance improvements to 3.1x over DaDN. Finally, Pragmatic benefits persist even with an 8-bit quantized representation [5].",0
"In most current applications of belief networks, domain knowledge is represented by a single belief network that applies to all problem instances in the domain. In more complex domains, problem-specific models must be constructed from a knowledge base encoding probabilistic relationships in the domain. Most work in knowledge-based model construction takes the rule as the basic unit of knowledge. We present a knowledge representation framework that permits the knowledge base designer to specify knowledge in larger semantically meaningful units which we call network fragments. Our framework provides for representation of asymmetric independence and canonical intercausal interaction. We discuss the combination of network fragments to form problem-specific models to reason about particular problem instances. The framework is illustrated using examples from the domain of military situation awareness.",0
"In this paper, we present the results obtained by our DKP-AOM system within the OAEI 2015 campaign. DKP-AOM is an ontology merging tool designed to merge heterogeneous ontologies. In OAEI, we have participated with its ontology mapping component which serves as a basic module capable of matching large scale ontologies before their merging. This is our first successful participation in the Conference, OA4QA and Anatomy track of OAEI. DKP-AOM is participating with two versions (DKP-AOM and DKP-AOM_lite), DKP-AOM performs coherence analysis. In OA4QA track, DKPAOM out-performed in the evaluation and generated accurate alignments allowed to answer all the queries of the evaluation. We can also see its competitive results for the conference track in the evaluation initiative among other reputed systems. In the anatomy track, it has produced alignments within an allocated time and appeared in the list of systems which produce coherent results. Finally, we discuss some future work towards the development of DKP-AOM.",0
"We study the problem of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning with a single joint reward signal. This class of learning problems is difficult because of the often large combined action and observation spaces. In the fully centralized and decentralized approaches, we find the problem of spurious rewards and a phenomenon we call the ""lazy agent"" problem, which arises due to partial observability. We address these problems by training individual agents with a novel value decomposition network architecture, which learns to decompose the team value function into agent-wise value functions. We perform an experimental evaluation across a range of partially-observable multi-agent domains and show that learning such value-decompositions leads to superior results, in particular when combined with weight sharing, role information and information channels.",0
"This paper deals with the distributed processing in the search for an optimum classification model using evolutionary product unit neural networks. For this distributed search we used a cluster of computers. Our objective is to obtain a more efficient design than those net architectures which do not use a distributed process and which thus result in simpler designs. In order to get the best classification models we use evolutionary algorithms to train and design neural networks, which require a very time consuming computation. The reasons behind the need for this distribution are various. It is complicated to train this type of nets because of the difficulty entailed in determining their architecture due to the complex error surface. On the other hand, the use of evolutionary algorithms involves running a great number of tests with different seeds and parameters, thus resulting in a high computational cost",0
"Recent papers address the issue of updating the instance level of knowledge bases expressed in Description Logic following a model-based approach. One of the outcomes of these papers is that the result of updating a knowledge base K is generally not expressible in the Description Logic used to express K. In this paper we introduce a formula-based approach to this problem, by revisiting some research work on formula-based updates developed in the '80s, in particular the WIDTIO (When In Doubt, Throw It Out) approach. We show that our operator enjoys desirable properties, including that both insertions and deletions according to such operator can be expressed in the DL used for the original KB. Also, we present polynomial time algorithms for the evolution of the instance level knowledge bases expressed in the most expressive Description Logics of the DL-lite family.",0
"We investigate two new optimization problems -- minimizing a submodular function subject to a submodular lower bound constraint (submodular cover) and maximizing a submodular function subject to a submodular upper bound constraint (submodular knapsack). We are motivated by a number of real-world applications in machine learning including sensor placement and data subset selection, which require maximizing a certain submodular function (like coverage or diversity) while simultaneously minimizing another (like cooperative cost). These problems are often posed as minimizing the difference between submodular functions [14, 35] which is in the worst case inapproximable. We show, however, that by phrasing these problems as constrained optimization, which is more natural for many applications, we achieve a number of bounded approximation guarantees. We also show that both these problems are closely related and an approximation algorithm solving one can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee for the other. We provide hardness results for both problems thus showing that our approximation factors are tight up to log-factors. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance and good scalability properties of our algorithms.",1
"The discovery, representation and reconstruction of (technical) integration networks from Network Mining (NM) raw data is a difficult problem for enterprises. This is due to large and complex IT landscapes within and across enterprise boundaries, heterogeneous technology stacks, and fragmented data. To remain competitive, visibility into the enterprise and partner IT networks on different, interrelated abstraction levels is desirable.",0
"Neural networks have proven effective at solving difficult problems but designing their architectures can be challenging, even for image classification problems alone. Evolutionary algorithms provide a technique to discover such networks automatically. Despite significant computational requirements, we show that evolving models that rival large, hand-designed architectures is possible today. We employ simple evolutionary techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions. To do this, we use novel and intuitive mutation operators that navigate large search spaces. We stress that no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trained model. Throughout this work, we place special emphasis on the repeatability of results, the variability in the outcomes and the computational requirements.",1
"Traditional pattern mining algorithms generally suffer from a lack of flexibility. In this paper, we propose a SAT formulation of the problem to successfully mine frequent flexible sequences occurring in transactional datasets. Our SAT-based approach can easily be extended with extra constraints to address a broad range of pattern mining applications. To demonstrate this claim, we formulate and add several constraints, such as gap and span constraints, to our model in order to extract more specific patterns. We also use interactive solving to perform important derived tasks, such as closed pattern mining or maximal pattern mining. Finally, we prove the practical feasibility of our SAT model by running experiments on two real datasets.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the learning of policies for complex tasks in partially observable environments, without explicitly learning the underlying model of the tasks. While such model-free methods achieve considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a natural representation of to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems using Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), to better exploit this inherent structure. We define 3 such RCNNs, whose forward passes execute an efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Backpropagating gradients through these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP, serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of replanning, learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learnt models to achieve near-optimal policies.",0
"A fundamental problem in control is to learn a model of a system from observations that is useful for controller synthesis. To provide good performance guarantees, existing methods must assume that the real system is in the class of models considered during learning. We present an iterative method with strong guarantees even in the agnostic case where the system is not in the class. In particular, we show that any no-regret online learning algorithm can be used to obtain a near-optimal policy, provided some model achieves low training error and access to a good exploration distribution. Our approach applies to both discrete and continuous domains. We demonstrate its efficacy and scalability on a challenging helicopter domain from the literature.",1
"For robotic vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in pedestrian-rich environments, it is important to model subtle human behaviors and navigation rules. However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.",0
This paper specifies a notation for Markov decision processes.,0
"In this paper, we analyze the relationship between probability and Spohn's theory for representation of uncertain beliefs. Using the intuitive idea that the more probable a proposition is, the more believable it is, we study transformations from probability to Sphonian disbelief and vice-versa. The transformations described in this paper are different from those described in the literature. In particular, the former satisfies the principles of ordinal congruence while the latter does not. Such transformations between probability and Spohn's calculi can contribute to (1) a clarification of the semantics of nonprobabilistic degree of uncertain belief, and (2) to a construction of a decision theory for such calculi. In practice, the transformations will allow a meaningful combination of more than one calculus in different stages of using an expert system such as knowledge acquisition, inference, and interpretation of results.",0
"Spreadsheet workbook contents are simple programs. Because of this, probabilistic programming techniques can be used to perform Bayesian inversion of spreadsheet computations. What is more, existing execution engines in spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel can be made to do this using only built-in functionality. We demonstrate this by developing a native Excel implementation of both a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo variant and black-box variational inference for spreadsheet probabilistic programming. The resulting engine performs probabilistically coherent inference over spreadsheet computations, notably including spreadsheets that include user-defined black-box functions. Spreadsheet engines that choose to integrate the functionality we describe in this paper will give their users the ability to both easily develop probabilistic models and maintain them over time by including actuals via a simple user-interface mechanism. For spreadsheet end-users this would mean having access to efficient and probabilistically coherent probabilistic modeling and inference for use in all kinds of decision making under uncertainty.",0
"The First Trading Agent Competition (TAC) was held from June 22nd to July 8th, 2000. TAC was designed to create a benchmark problem in the complex domain of e-marketplaces and to motivate researchers to apply unique approaches to a common task. This article describes ATTac-2000, the first-place finisher in TAC. ATTac-2000 uses a principled bidding strategy that includes several elements of adaptivity. In addition to the success at the competition, isolated empirical results are presented indicating the robustness and effectiveness of ATTac-2000's adaptive strategy.",0
"The proposed methodology is procedural i.e. it follows finite number of steps that extracts relevant documents according to users query. It is based on principles of Data Mining for analyzing web data. Data Mining first adapts integration of data to generate warehouse. Then, it extracts useful information with the help of algorithm. The task of representing extracted documents is done by using Vector Based Statistical Approach that represents each document in set of Terms.",0
"This paper proposes a new mechanism for pruning a search game-tree in computer chess. The algorithm stores and then reuses chains or sequences of moves, built up from previous searches. These move sequences have a built-in forward-pruning mechanism that can radically reduce the search space. A typical search process might retrieve a move from a Transposition Table, where the decision of what move to retrieve would be based on the position itself. This algorithm stores move sequences based on what previous sequences were better, or caused cutoffs. This is therefore position independent and so it could also be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole situation is not known at any one time. Over a small set of tests, the algorithm was shown to clearly out-perform Transposition Tables, both in terms of search reduction and game-play results.",0
"A negotiation team is a set of agents with common and possibly also conflicting preferences that forms one of the parties of a negotiation. A negotiation team is involved in two decision making processes simultaneously, a negotiation with the opponents, and an intra-team process to decide on the moves to make in the negotiation. This article focuses on negotiation team decision making for circumstances that require unanimity of team decisions. Existing agent-based approaches only guarantee unanimity in teams negotiating in domains exclusively composed of predictable and compatible issues. This article presents a model for negotiation teams that guarantees unanimous team decisions in domains consisting of predictable and compatible, and also unpredictable issues. Moreover, the article explores the influence of using opponent, and team member models in the proposing strategies that team members use. Experimental results show that the team benefits if team members employ Bayesian learning to model their teammates' preferences.",0
"Non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft cause significant harm to our economies, as in some countries they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. Detecting NTLs requires costly on-site inspections. Accurate prediction of NTLs for customers using machine learning is therefore crucial. To date, related research largely ignore that the two classes of regular and non-regular customers are highly imbalanced, that NTL proportions may change and mostly consider small data sets, often not allowing to deploy the results in production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to assess three NTL detection models for different NTL proportions in large real world data sets of 100Ks of customers: Boolean rules, fuzzy logic and Support Vector Machine. This work has resulted in appreciable results that are about to be deployed in a leading industry solution. We believe that the considerations and observations made in this contribution are necessary for future smart meter research in order to report their effectiveness on imbalanced and large real world data sets.",0
"In the existing evidential networks with belief functions, the relations among the variables are always represented by joint belief functions on the product space of the involved variables. In this paper, we use conditional belief functions to represent such relations in the network and show some relations of these two kinds of representations. We also present a propagation algorithm for such networks. By analyzing the properties of some special evidential networks with conditional belief functions, we show that the reasoning process can be simplified in such kinds of networks.",0
"Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms have been successfully applied to a large number of symmetric graphical models. Unfortunately, the majority of real-world graphical models is asymmetric. This is even the case for relational representations when evidence is given. Therefore, more recent work in the community moved to making the models symmetric and then applying existing lifted inference algorithms. However, this approach has two shortcomings. First, all existing over-symmetric approximations require a relational representation such as Markov logic networks. Second, the induced symmetries often change the distribution significantly, making the computed probabilities highly biased. We present a framework for probabilistic sampling-based inference that only uses the induced approximate symmetries to propose steps in a Metropolis-Hastings style Markov chain. The framework, therefore, leads to improved probability estimates while remaining unbiased. Experiments demonstrate that the approach outperforms existing MCMC algorithms.",1
"Traditional AI reasoning techniques have been used successfully in many domains, including logistics, scheduling and game playing. This paper is part of a project aimed at investigating how such techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments. Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate -- and communication actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among distributed agents as a given. We address this challenge by developing an agent architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). Although ASP has been used successfully in a number of applications, to the best of our knowledge this is the first practical application of a complete ASP-based agent architecture. It is also the first practical application of ASP involving a combination of centralized reasoning, decentralized reasoning, execution monitoring, and reasoning about network communications.",0
"Because of several technological limitations of traditional silicon based computing, for past few years a paradigm shift, from silicon to carbon, is occurring in computational world. DNA computing has been considered to be quite promising in solving computational and reasoning problems by using DNA strands. Resolution, an important aspect of automated theorem proving and mathematical logic, is a rule of inference which leads to proof by contradiction technique for sentences in propositional logic and first-order logic. This can also be called refutation theorem-proving. In this paper we have shown how the theorem proving with resolution refutation by DNA computation can be represented by the semantics of process calculus and strand graph.",0
"In this work we propose a multi-valued extension of logic programs under the stable models semantics where each true atom in a model is associated with a set of justifications. These justifications are expressed in terms of causal graphs formed by rule labels and edges that represent their application ordering. For positive programs, we show that the causal justifications obtained for a given atom have a direct correspon- dence to (relevant) syntactic proofs of that atom using the program rules involved in the graphs. The most interesting contribution is that this causal information is obtained in a purely semantic way, by algebraic op- erations (product, sum and application) on a lattice of causal values whose ordering relation expresses when a justification is stronger than another. Finally, for programs with negation, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz's program reduct. As a result, default negation behaves as ""absence of proof"" and no justification is derived from negative liter",0
"The concept of movable evidence masses that flow from supersets to subsets as specified by experts represents a suitable framework for reasoning under uncertainty. The mass flow is controlled by specialization matrices. New evidence is integrated into the frame of discernment by conditioning or revision (Dempster's rule of conditioning), for which special specialization matrices exist. Even some aspects of non-monotonic reasoning can be represented by certain specialization matrices.",0
"To improve the effectiveness of the fuzzy identification, a structure identification method based on moving rate is proposed for T-S fuzzy model. The proposed method is called ""T-S modeling (or T-S fuzzy identification method) based on moving rate"". First, to improve the shortcomings of existing fuzzy reasoning methods based on matching degree, the moving rates for s-type, z-type and trapezoidal membership functions of T-S fuzzy model were defined. Then, the differences between proposed moving rate and existing matching degree were explained. Next, the identification method based on moving rate is proposed for T-S model. Finally, the proposed identification method is applied to the fuzzy modeling for the precipitation forecast and security situation prediction. Test results show that the proposed method significantly improves the effectiveness of fuzzy identification.",0
"Bayesian belief network learning algorithms have three basic components: a measure of a network structure and a database, a search heuristic that chooses network structures to be considered, and a method of estimating the probability tables from the database. This paper contributes to all these three topics. The behavior of the Bayesian measure of Cooper and Herskovits and a minimum description length (MDL) measure are compared with respect to their properties for both limiting size and finite size databases. It is shown that the MDL measure has more desirable properties than the Bayesian measure when a distribution is to be learned. It is shown that selecting belief networks with certain minimallity properties is NP-hard. This result justifies the use of search heuristics instead of exact algorithms for choosing network structures to be considered. In some cases, a collection of belief networks can be represented by a single belief network which leads to a new kind of probability table estimation called smoothing. We argue that smoothing can be efficiently implemented by incorporating it in the search heuristic. Experimental results suggest that for learning probabilities of belief networks smoothing is helpful.",0
"A backbone of a boolean formula $F$ is a collection $S$ of its variables for which there is a unique partial assignment $a_S$ such that $F[a_S]$ is satisfiable [MZK+99,WGS03]. This paper studies the nontransparency of backbones. We show that, under the widely believed assumption that integer factoring is hard, there exist sets of boolean formulas that have obvious, nontrivial backbones yet finding the values, $a_S$, of those backbones is intractable. We also show that, under the same assumption, there exist sets of boolean formulas that obviously have large backbones yet producing such a backbone $S$ is intractable. Further, we show that if integer factoring is not merely worst-case hard but is frequently hard, as is widely believed, then the frequency of hardness in our two results is not too much less than that frequency.",1
"The idea of dynamic move chains has been described in a preceding paper [6]. It allows the search tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be dangerous, because that can remove important moves which would only be evaluated through a more exhaustive search process. This paper has added to the forward-pruning technique, through the use of 'Move Tables' that can act in the same way as Transposition Tables, but for moves not positions. They use an efficient memory structure and have put the design into the context of short or long-term memories. These can allow the search to be broadened, making it more reliable and are relatively independent, allowing some configuration as to how much to use. It has advanced some of the future work theory of the earlier paper and made more explicit where logical plans or more knowledge-based approaches might be applied.",0
"Ontology alignment is widely used to find the correspondences between different ontologies in diverse fields. After discovering the alignment by methods, several performance scores are available to evaluate them. The scores require the produced alignment by a method and the reference alignment containing the underlying actual correspondences of the given ontologies. The current trend in alignment evaluation is to put forward a new score and to compare various alignments by juxtaposing their performance scores. However, it is substantially provocative to select one performance score among others for comparison. On top of that, claiming if one method has a better performance than one another can not be substantiated by solely comparing the scores. In this paper, we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically favor one method over one another. The McNemar test is considered as a reliable and suitable means for comparing two ontology alignment methods over one matching task. The test applies to a 2 x 2 contingency table which can be constructed in two different ways based on the alignments, each of which has their own merits/pitfalls. The ways of the contingency table construction and various apposite statistics from the McNemar test are elaborated in minute detail. In the case of having more than two alignment methods for comparison, the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. Thus, the ways of preventing such an error are also discussed. A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the McNemar test in the presence of multiple alignment methods. From this graph, it is readily understood if one method is better than one another or if their differences are imperceptible. Our investigation on the methods participated in the anatomy track of OAEI 2016 demonstrates that AML and CroMatcher are the top two methods and DKP-AOM and Alin are the bottom two ones.",0
"We propose a novel Bayesian approach to solve stochastic optimization problems that involve finding extrema of noisy, nonlinear functions. Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of first, doing inference over the function space and second, finding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior where the natural parameter corresponds to a given kernel function and the sufficient statistic is composed of the observed function values. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function.",1
"The number of publicly available Web services (WS) is continuously growing, and in parallel, we are witnessing a rapid development in semantic-related web technologies. The intersection of the semantic web and WS allows the development of semantic WS. In this work, we adopt a complex network perspective to perform a comparative analysis of the syntactic and semantic approaches used to describe WS. From a collection of publicly available WS descriptions, we extract syntactic and semantic WS interaction networks. We take advantage of tools from the complex network field to analyze them and determine their properties. We show that WS interaction networks exhibit some of the typical characteristics observed in real-world networks, such as short average distance between nodes and community structure. By comparing syntactic and semantic networks through their properties, we show the introduction of semantics in WS descriptions should improve the composition process.",0
"This paper aims to highlight distinctive features of the ""SP theory of intelligence"" and its apparent advantages compared with some AI-related alternatives. The theory is outlined in an appendix. The distinctive features and advantages are summarised: simplification and integration of observations and concepts, and of structures and processes in computing systems; the SP theory is itself a theory of computing; a central role for information compression via the matching and unification of patterns, and for multiple alignment; transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge; the discovery of 'natural' structures via information compression (DONSVIC); interpretation of aspects of mathematics; interpretation of phenomena in human perception and cognition; realisation of abstract concepts in terms of neurons and their inter-connections (""SP-neural""). Distinctive features and advantages of the SP system compared with alternatives in: minimum length encoding and related concepts; deep learning in neural networks; universal search; Bayesian networks and other models for AI; analysis and production of natural language; learning natural language; exact and inexact reasoning; representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge; IBM's Watson; problems associated with big data, and in the development of intelligence in autonomous robots. In conclusion, a major strength of SP system is that it can provide a firm foundation for the long-term development of AI and, at the same time, it may deliver some benefits and applications on relatively short timescales. It is envisaged that a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine will be created, hosted on an existing high-performance computer and derived from the existing SP computer model. This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and to create new versions of it.",0
"The increasing amount of available Linked Data resources is laying the foundations for more advanced Semantic Web applications. One of their main limitations, however, remains the general low level of data quality. In this paper we focus on a measure of quality which is negatively affected by the increase of the available resources. We propose a measure of semantic richness of Linked Data concepts and we demonstrate our hypothesis that the more a concept is reused, the less semantically rich it becomes. This is a significant scalability issue, as one of the core aspects of Linked Data is the propagation of semantic information on the Web by reusing common terms. We prove our hypothesis with respect to our measure of semantic richness and we validate our model empirically. Finally, we suggest possible future directions to address this scalability problem.",0
"Search is a major technique for planning. It amounts to exploring a state space of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph. However, prohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive. Developing better heuristic functions has been the main technique for improving search efficiency. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that improving heuristics alone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency. Recently, a new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been proposed as an alternative to improving heuristics. POR has shown promise in speeding up searches.",0
"In this paper, we consider the task of learning control policies for text-based games. In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against a baseline with a bag-of-words state representation. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline on quest completion by 54% on a newly created world and by 14% on a pre-existing fantasy game.",1
"A new natural language understanding method for disambiguation of difficult pronouns is described. Difficult pronouns are those pronouns for which a level of world or domain knowledge is needed in order to perform anaphoral or other types of resolution. Resolution of difficult pronouns may in some cases require a prior step involving the application of inference to a situation that is represented by the natural language text. A general method is described: it performs entity resolution and pronoun resolution. An extension to the general pronoun resolution method performs inference as an embedded commonsense reasoning method. The general method and the embedded method utilize features of the ROSS representational scheme; in particular the methods use ROSS ontology classes and the ROSS situation model. The overall method is a working solution that solves the following Winograd schemas: a) trophy and suitcase, b) person lifts person, c) person pays detective, and d) councilmen and demonstrators.",0
"Study of soft sets was first proposed by Molodtsov in 1999 to deal with uncertainty in a non-parametric manner. The researchers did not pay attention to soft set theory at that time but now the soft set theory has been developed in many areas of mathematics. Algebraic structures using soft set theory are very rapidly developed. In this book we developed soft neutrosophic algebraic structures by using soft sets and neutrosophic algebraic structures. In this book we study soft neutrosophic groups, soft neutrosophic semigroups, soft neutrosophic loops, soft neutrosophic LA-semigroups, and their generalizations respectively.",0
"Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, including spatial dependencies (nearby and distant), temporal dependencies (closeness, period, trend), and external conditions (e.g., weather and events). We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast two types of crowd flows (i.e. inflow and outflow) in each and every region of a city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We have developed a real-time system based on Microsoft Azure Cloud, called UrbanFlow, providing the crowd flow monitoring and forecasting in Guiyang City of China. In addition, we present an extensive experimental evaluation using two types of crowd flows in Beijing and New York City (NYC), where ST-ResNet outperforms nine well-known baselines.",0
"Representation and learning of commonsense knowledge is one of the foundational problems in the quest to enable deep language understanding. This issue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story Cloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense stories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental evaluation shows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on shallow language understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story Cloze Test. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and offer suggestions for deeper language understanding.",0
"Inspired by the recent success of methods that employ shape priors to achieve robust 3D reconstructions, we propose a novel recurrent neural network architecture that we call the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network (3D-R2N2). The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data. Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).",0
"Neutrosophic set has the ability to handle uncertain, incomplete, inconsistent, indeterminate information in a more accurate way. In this paper, we proposed a neutrosophic recommender system to predict the diseases based on neutrosophic set which includes single-criterion neutrosophic recommender system (SC-NRS) and multi-criterion neutrosophic recommender system (MC-NRS). Further, we investigated some algebraic operations of neutrosophic recommender system such as union, complement, intersection, probabilistic sum, bold sum, bold intersection, bounded difference, symmetric difference, convex linear sum of min and max operators, Cartesian product, associativity, commutativity and distributive. Based on these operations, we studied the algebraic structures such as lattices, Kleen algebra, de Morgan algebra, Brouwerian algebra, BCK algebra, Stone algebra and MV algebra. In addition, we introduced several types of similarity measures based on these algebraic operations and studied some of their theoretic properties. Moreover, we accomplished a prediction formula using the proposed algebraic similarity measure. We also proposed a new algorithm for medical diagnosis based on neutrosophic recommender system. Finally to check the validity of the proposed methodology, we made experiments on the datasets Heart, RHC, Breast cancer, Diabetes and DMD. At the end, we presented the MSE and computational time by comparing the proposed algorithm with the relevant ones such as ICSM, DSM, CARE, CFMD, as well as other variants namely Variant 67, Variant 69, and Varian 71 both in tabular and graphical form to analyze the efficiency and accuracy. Finally we analyzed the strength of all 8 algorithms by ANOVA statistical tool.",0
"Quick interaction between a human teacher and a learning machine presents numerous benefits and challenges when working with web-scale data. The human teacher guides the machine towards accomplishing the task of interest. The learning machine leverages big data to find examples that maximize the training value of its interaction with the teacher. When the teacher is restricted to labeling examples selected by the machine, this problem is an instance of active learning. When the teacher can provide additional information to the machine (e.g., suggestions on what examples or predictive features should be used) as the learning task progresses, then the problem becomes one of interactive learning.",0
There is a generic way to add any new feature to a system. It involves 1) identifying the basic units which build up the system and 2) introducing the new feature to each of these basic units.,0
The dynamics of belief and knowledge is one of the major components of any autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. We show that knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. Many different view update algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach.,0
"Monitoring plan preconditions can allow for replanning when a precondition fails, generally far in advance of the point in the plan where the precondition is relevant. However, monitoring is generally costly, and some precondition failures have a very small impact on plan quality. We formulate a model for optimal precondition monitoring, using partially-observable Markov decisions processes, and describe methods for solving this model efficitively, though approximately. Specifically, we show that the single-precondition monitoring problem is generally tractable, and the multiple-precondition monitoring policies can be efficitively approximated using single-precondition soultions.",0
"As most database users cannot precisely express their information needs, it is challenging for database querying and exploration interfaces to understand them. We propose a novel formal framework for representing and understanding information needs in database querying and exploration. Our framework considers querying as a collaboration between the user and the database system to establish a mutual language for representing information needs. We formalize this collaboration as a signaling game, where each mutual language is an equilibrium for the game. A query interface is more effective if it establishes a less ambiguous mutual language faster. We discuss some equilibria, strategies, and the convergence in this game. In particular, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism and analyze it within our framework. We prove that this adaptation mechanism for the query interface improves the effectiveness of answering queries stochastically speaking, and converges almost surely. Most importantly, we show that the proposed learning rule is robust to the choice of the metric/reward by the database.",0
"Entity Resolution, also called record linkage or deduplication, refers to the process of identifying and merging duplicate versions of the same entity into a unified representation. The standard practice is to use a Rule based or Machine Learning based model that compares entity pairs and assigns a score to represent the pairs' Match/Non-Match status. However, performing an exhaustive pair-wise comparison on all pairs of records leads to quadratic matcher complexity and hence a Blocking step is performed before the Matching to group similar entities into smaller blocks that the matcher can then examine exhaustively. Several blocking schemes have been developed to efficiently and effectively block the input dataset into manageable groups. At CareerBuilder (CB), we perform deduplication on massive datasets of people profiles collected from disparate sources with varying informational content. We observed that, employing a single blocking technique did not cover the base for all possible scenarios due to the multi-faceted nature of our data sources. In this paper, we describe our ensemble approach to blocking that combines two different blocking techniques to leverage their respective strengths.",0
"The main objective of this paper is to develop a new semantic Network structure, based on the fuzzy sets theory, used in Artificial Intelligent system in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems. This Semantic Networks is used to describe the knowledge of an ""ideal"" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an ""ideal"" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as ""Word"" and Goals such as ""Cut"" or ""Copy"". We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation's levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user's fuzzy queries.",0
"Artificial intelligence methods have often been applied to perform specific functions or tasks in the cyber-defense realm. However, as adversary methods become more complex and difficult to divine, piecemeal efforts to understand cyber-attacks, and malware-based attacks in particular, are not providing sufficient means for malware analysts to understand the past, present and future characteristics of malware.",0
"In a world where communication and information sharing are at the heart of our business, the terminology needs are most pressing. It has become imperative to identify the terms used and defined in a consensual and coherent way while preserving linguistic diversity. To streamline and strengthen the process of acquisition, representation and exploitation of scenarii of train accidents, it is necessary to harmonize and standardize the terminology used by players in the security field. The research aims to significantly improve analytical activities and operations of the various safety studies, by tracking the error in system, hardware, software and human. This paper presents the contribution of ontology to modeling scenarii for rail accidents through a knowledge model based on a generic ontology and domain ontology. After a detailed presentation of the state of the art material, this article presents the first results of the developed model.",0
"Keyphrase boundary classification (KBC) is the task of detecting keyphrases in scientific articles and labelling them with respect to predefined types. Although important in practice, this task is so far underexplored, partly due to the lack of labelled data. To overcome this, we explore several auxiliary tasks, including semantic super-sense tagging and identification of multi-word expressions, and cast the task as a multi-task learning problem with deep recurrent neural networks. Our multi-task models perform significantly better than previous state of the art approaches on two scientific KBC datasets, particularly for long keyphrases.",1
"The notion of class is ubiquitous in computer science and is central in many formalisms for the representation of structured knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases. In this paper we study the basic issues underlying such representation formalisms and single out both their common characteristics and their distinguishing features. Such investigation leads us to propose a unifying framework in which we are able to capture the fundamental aspects of several representation languages used in different contexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of description logics, which have been introduced in knowledge representation as a means to provide a semantically well-founded basis for the structural aspects of knowledge representation systems. The description logic considered in this paper is a subset of first order logic with nice computational characteristics. It is quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs that has not been studied before. The distinguishing constructs are number restrictions, which generalize existence and functional dependencies, inverse roles, which allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly cyclic assertions, which are necessary for capturing real world domains. We are able to show that it is precisely such combination of constructs that makes our logic powerful enough to model the essential set of features for defining class structures that are common to frame systems, object-oriented database languages, and semantic data models. As a consequence of the established correspondences, several significant extensions of each of the above formalisms become available. The high expressiveness of the logic we propose and the need for capturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and finite model reasoning. A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both cases is decidable. We argue that, by virtue of the high expressive power and of the associated reasoning capabilities on both unrestricted and finite models, our logic provides a common core for class-based representation formalisms.",0
"We present a novel extension of Thompson Sampling for stochastic sequential decision problems with graph feedback, even when the graph structure itself is unknown and/or changing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the Bayesian regret of the algorithm, linking its performance to the underlying properties of the graph. Thompson Sampling has the advantage of being applicable without the need to construct complicated upper confidence bounds for different problems. We illustrate its performance through extensive experimental results on real and simulated networks with graph feedback. More specifically, we tested our algorithms on power law, planted partitions and Erdo's-Renyi graphs, as well as on graphs derived from Facebook and Flixster data. These all show that our algorithms clearly outperform related methods that employ upper confidence bounds, even if the latter use more information about the graph.",1
"We present two new and efficient algorithms for computing all-pairs shortest paths. The algorithms operate on directed graphs with real (possibly negative) weights. They make use of directed path consistency along a vertex ordering d. Both algorithms run in O(n^2 w_d) time, where w_d is the graph width induced by this vertex ordering. For graphs of constant treewidth, this yields O(n^2) time, which is optimal. On chordal graphs, the algorithms run in O(nm) time. In addition, we present a variant that exploits graph separators to arrive at a run time of O(n w_d^2 + n^2 s_d) on general graphs, where s_d andlt= w_d is the size of the largest minimal separator induced by the vertex ordering d. We show empirically that on both constructed and realistic benchmarks, in many cases the algorithms outperform Floyd-Warshalls as well as Johnsons algorithm, which represent the current state of the art with a run time of O(n^3) and O(nm + n^2 log n), respectively. Our algorithms can be used for spatial and temporal reasoning, such as for the Simple Temporal Problem, which underlines their relevance to the planning and scheduling community.",0
"In this paper we focus on finding high quality solutions for the problem of maximum partitioning of graphs with supply and demand (MPGSD). There is a growing interest for the MPGSD due to its close connection to problems appearing in the field of electrical distribution systems, especially for the optimization of self-adequacy of interconnected microgrids. We propose an ant colony optimization algorithm for the problem. With the goal of further improving the algorithm we combine it with a previously developed correction procedure. In our computational experiments we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on both trees and general graphs. The tests show that the method manages to find optimal solutions in more than 50% of the problem instances, and has an average relative error of less than 0.5% when compared to known optimal solutions.",0
"The paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the performance of likelihood weighting (LW) on a subset of nodes in Bayesian networks. The proposed scheme requires fewer samples to converge due to reduction in sampling variance. The method exploits the structure of the network to bound the complexity of exact inference used to compute sampling distributions, similar to Gibbs cutset sampling. Yet, the extension of the previosly proposed cutset sampling principles to likelihood weighting is non-trivial due to differences in the sampling processes of Gibbs sampler and LW. We demonstrate empirically that likelihood weighting on a cutset (LWLC) is effective time-wise and has a lower rejection rate than LW when applied to networks with many deterministic probabilities. Finally, we show that the performance of likelihood weighting on a cutset can be improved further by caching computed sampling distributions and, consequently, learning 'zeros' of the target distribution.",0
"For assignment problems where agents, specifying ordinal preferences, are allocated indivisible objects, two widely studied randomized mechanisms are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). These two mechanisms both have desirable economic and computational properties, but the outcomes they induce can be incomparable in many instances, thus creating challenges in deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper we first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposed to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable when there are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, we provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyze economic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of each mechanism in different application domains.",0
"A simple advertising strategy that can be used to help increase sales of a product is to mail out special offers to selected potential customers. Because there is a cost associated with sending each offer, the optimal mailing strategy depends on both the benefit obtained from a purchase and how the offer affects the buying behavior of the customers. In this paper, we describe two methods for partitioning the potential customers into groups, and show how to perform a simple cost-benefit analysis to decide which, if any, of the groups should be targeted. In particular, we consider two decision-tree learning algorithms. The first is an ""off the shelf"" algorithm used to model the probability that groups of customers will buy the product. The second is a new algorithm that is similar to the first, except that for each group, it explicitly models the probability of purchase under the two mailing scenarios: (1) the mail is sent to members of that group and (2) the mail is not sent to members of that group. Using data from a real-world advertising experiment, we compare the algorithms to each other and to a naive mail-to-all strategy.",0
Algorithms that generate computer game content require game design knowledge. We present an approach to automatically learn game design knowledge for level design from gameplay videos. We further demonstrate how the acquired design knowledge can be used to generate sections of game levels. Our approach involves parsing video of people playing a game to detect the appearance of patterns of sprites and utilizing machine learning to build a probabilistic model of sprite placement. We show how rich game design information can be automatically parsed from gameplay videos and represented as a set of generative probabilistic models. We use Super Mario Bros. as a proof of concept. We evaluate our approach on a measure of playability and stylistic similarity to the original levels as represented in the gameplay videos.,0
"The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of the stirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate for the solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. In the VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best solution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides simplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along. Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to select a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to being trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-size adjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the created candidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if the algorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes much more difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latter iterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposed to overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVS algorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points at each iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of this modification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improved and the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABC algorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.",0
"In this paper we present a broad overview of the last 40 years of research on cognitive architectures. Although the number of existing architectures is nearing several hundred, most of the existing surveys do not reflect this growth and focus on a handful of well-established architectures. While their contributions are undeniable, they represent only a part of the research in the field. Thus, in this survey we wanted to shift the focus towards a more inclusive and high-level overview of the research in cognitive architectures. Our final set of 86 architectures includes 55 that are still actively developed, and borrow from a diverse set of disciplines, spanning areas from psychoanalysis to neuroscience. To keep the length of this paper within reasonable limits we discuss only the core cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention mechanisms, learning and memory structure. To assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we gathered information on over 700 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list. We use various visualization techniques to highlight overall trends in the development of the field. Our analysis of practical applications shows that most architectures are very narrowly focused on a particular application domain. Furthermore, there is an apparent gap between general research in robotics and computer vision and research in these areas within the cognitive architectures field. It is very clear that biologically inspired models do not have the same range and efficiency compared to the systems based on engineering principles and heuristics. Another observation is related to a general lack of collaboration. Several factors hinder communication, such as the closed nature of the individual projects (only one-third of the reviewed here architectures are open-source) and terminological differences.",0
"User preferences for automated assistance often vary widely, depending on the situation, and quality or presentation of help. Developing effectivemodels to learn individual preferences online requires domain models that associate observations of user behavior with their utility functions, which in turn can be constructed using utility elicitation techniques. However, most elicitation methods ask for users' predicted utilities based on hypothetical scenarios rather than more realistic experienced utilities. This is especially true in interface customization, where users are asked to assess novel interface designs. We propose experiential utility elicitation methods for customization and compare these to predictivemethods. As experienced utilities have been argued to better reflect true preferences in behavioral decision making, the purpose here is to investigate accurate and efficient procedures that are suitable for software domains. Unlike conventional elicitation, our results indicate that an experiential approach helps people understand stochastic outcomes, as well as better appreciate the sequential utility of intelligent assistance.",0
"We present Populous, a tool for gathering content with which to populate an ontology. Domain experts need to add content, that is often repetitive in its form, but without having to tackle the underlying ontological representation. Populous presents users with a table based form in which columns are constrained to take values from particular ontologies; the user can select a concept from an ontology via its meaningful label to give a value for a given entity attribute. Populated tables are mapped to patterns that can then be used to automatically generate the ontology's content. Populous's contribution is in the knowledge gathering stage of ontology development. It separates knowledge gathering from the conceptualisation and also separates the user from the standard ontology authoring environments. As a result, Populous can allow knowledge to be gathered in a straight-forward manner that can then be used to do mass production of ontology content.",0
"Text analysis includes lexical analysis of the text and has been widely studied and used in diverse applications. In the last decade, researchers have proposed many efficient solutions to analyze / classify large text dataset, however, analysis / classification of short text is still a challenge because 1) the data is very sparse 2) It contains noise words and 3) It is difficult to understand the syntactical structure of the text. Short Messaging Service (SMS) is a text messaging service for mobile/smart phone and this service is frequently used by all mobile users. Because of the popularity of SMS service, marketing companies nowadays are also using this service for direct marketing also known as SMS marketing.In this paper, we have proposed Ontology based SMS Controller which analyze the text message and classify it using ontology aslegitimate or spam. The proposed system has been tested on different scenarios and experimental results shows that the proposed solution is effective both in terms of efficiency and time.",0
"There is much interest in applying reinforcement learning methods to multi-agent systems. A popular way to do so is the method of reactive training -- ie. treating other agents as if they are a stationary part of the learner's environment. Dyads of such learners, if they converge, will converge to Nash equilibria of the game. However, there is an important game theoretic issue here: positive-sum games can have multiple equilibria which differ in their payoffs. We show that even in simple coordination games reactive reinforcement learning agents will often coordinate on equilibria with suboptimal payoffs for both agents. We also show that receiving utility from rewards other agents receive - ie. having prosocial preferences - leads agents to converging to better equilibria in a class of generalized Stag Hunt games. We show this analytically for matrix games and experimentally for more complex Markov versions. Importantly, this is true even if only one of the agents has social preferences. This implies that even if an agent designer only controls a single agent out of a dyad and only cares about their agent's payoff, it can still be better for the designer to make the agent prosocial rather than selfish.",0
"Scientists often run experiments to distinguish competing theories. This requires patience, rigor, and ingenuity - there is often a large space of possible experiments one could run. But we need not comb this space by hand - if we represent our theories as formal models and explicitly declare the space of experiments, we can automate the search for good experiments, looking for those with high expected information gain. Here, we present a general and principled approach to experiment design based on probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). PPLs offer a clean separation between declaring problems and solving them, which means that the scientist can automate experiment design by simply declaring her model and experiment spaces in the PPL without having to worry about the details of calculating information gain. We demonstrate our system in two case studies drawn from cognitive psychology, where we use it to design optimal experiments in the domains of sequence prediction and categorization. We find strong empirical validation that our automatically designed experiments were indeed optimal. We conclude by discussing a number of interesting questions for future research.",0
"Community detection has attracted considerable attention crossing many areas as it can be used for discovering the structure and features of complex networks. With the increasing size of social networks in real world, community detection approaches should be fast and accurate. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is known to be one of the near-linear solutions and benefits of easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we extend the update rule and propagation criterion of LPA in the framework of belief functions. A new community detection approach, called Evidential Label Propagation (ELP), is proposed as an enhanced version of conventional LPA. The node influence is first defined to guide the propagation process. The plausibility is used to determine the domain label of each node. The update order of nodes is discussed to improve the robustness of the method. ELP algorithm will converge after the domain labels of all the nodes become unchanged. The mass assignments are calculated finally as memberships of nodes. The overlapping nodes and outliers can be detected simultaneously through the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ELP.",0
"Discourse structure is the hidden link between surface features and document-level properties, such as sentiment polarity. We show that the discourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can improve document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information up the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units according to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical structure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Next, we present a recursive neural network over the RST structure, which offers significant improvements over classification-based methods.",1
"In this paper, we present a Virtual-Suspect system which can be used to train inexperienced law enforcement personnel in interrogation strategies. The system supports different scenario configurations based on historical data. The responses presented by the Virtual-Suspect are selected based on the psychological state of the suspect, which can be configured as well. Furthermore, each interrogator's statement affects the Virtual-Suspect's current psychological state, which may lead the interrogation in different directions. In addition, the model takes into account the context in which the statements are made. Experiments with 24 subjects demonstrate that the Virtual-Suspect's behavior is similar to that of a human who plays the role of the suspect.",1
"The paper presents some steps for multi-valued representation of neutrosophic information. These steps are provided in the framework of multi-valued logics using the following logical value: true, false, neutral, unknown and saturated. Also, this approach provides some calculus formulae for the following neutrosophic features: truth, falsity, neutrality, ignorance, under-definedness, over-definedness, saturation and entropy. In addition, it was defined net truth, definedness and neutrosophic score.",0
"The notion of events has occupied a central role in modeling and has an influence in computer science and philosophy. Recent developments in diagrammatic modeling have made it possible to examine conceptual representation of events. This paper explores some aspects of the notion of events that are produced by applying a new diagrammatic methodology with a focus on the interaction of events with such concepts as time and space, objects. The proposed description applies to abstract machines where events form the dynamic phases of a system. The results of this nontechnical research can be utilized in many fields where the notion of an event is typically used in interdisciplinary application.",0
"We study propagation of the RegularGcc global constraint. This ensures that each row of a matrix of decision variables satisfies a Regular constraint, and each column satisfies a Gcc constraint. On the negative side, we prove that propagation is NP-hard even under some strong restrictions (e.g. just 3 values, just 4 states in the automaton, or just 5 columns to the matrix). On the positive side, we identify two cases where propagation is fixed parameter tractable. In addition, we show how to improve propagation over a simple decomposition into separate Regular and Gcc constraints by identifying some necessary but insufficient conditions for a solution. We enforce these conditions with some additional weighted row automata. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of these methods on some standard benchmark problems.",0
"We present theoretical results in terms of lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of noisy search with comparative feedback. In this search model, the noise in the feedback depends on the distance between query points and the search target. Consequently, the error probability in the feedback is not fixed but varies for the queries posed by the search algorithm. Our results show that a target out of n items can be found in O(log n) queries. We also show the surprising result that for k possible answers per query, the speedup is not log k (as for k-ary search) but only log log k in some cases.",0
Detection and segmentation of Brain tumor is very important because it provides anatomical information of normal and abnormal tissues which helps in treatment planning and patient follow-up. There are number of techniques for image segmentation. Proposed research work uses ANFIS (Artificial Neural Network Fuzzy Inference System) for image classification and then compares the results with FCM (Fuzzy C means) and K-NN (K-nearest neighbor). ANFIS includes benefits of both ANN and the fuzzy logic systems. A comprehensive feature set and fuzzy rules are selected to classify an abnormal image to the corresponding tumor type. Experimental results illustrate promising results in terms of classification accuracy. A comparative analysis is performed with the FCM and K-NN to show the superior nature of ANFIS systems.,0
"In this paper, we address the problem of change in an abstract argumentation system. We focus on a particular change: the addition of a new argument which interacts with previous arguments. We study the impact of such an addition on the outcome of the argumentation system, more particularly on the set of its extensions. Several properties for this change operation are defined by comparing the new set of extensions to the initial one, these properties are called structural when the comparisons are based on set-cardinality or set-inclusion relations. Several other properties are proposed where comparisons are based on the status of some particular arguments: the accepted arguments; these properties refer to the evolution of this status during the change, e.g., Monotony and Priority to Recency. All these properties may be more or less desirable according to specific applications. They are studied under two particular semantics: the grounded and preferred semantics.",0
"This article deals with plausible reasoning from incomplete knowledge about large-scale spatial properties. The availableinformation, consisting of a set of pointwise observations,is extrapolated to neighbour points. We make use of belief functions to represent the influence of the knowledge at a given point to another point; the quantitative strength of this influence decreases when the distance between both points increases. These influences arethen aggregated using a variant of Dempster's rule of combination which takes into account the relative dependence between observations.",0

"The recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence may leave many educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophical issues in their AI courses. As instructors we want to develop curriculum that not only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, but also to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that artificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general artificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial intelligence ethics course.",0
"We consider infinite-horizon stationary $\gamma$-discounted Markov Decision Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. Using Value and Policy Iteration with some error $\epsilon$ at each iteration, it is well-known that one can compute stationary policies that are $\frac{2\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$-optimal. After arguing that this guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy Iteration for computing non-stationary policies that can be up to $\frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$-optimal, which constitutes a significant improvement in the usual situation when $\gamma$ is close to 1. Surprisingly, this shows that the problem of ""computing near-optimal non-stationary policies"" is much simpler than that of ""computing near-optimal stationary policies"".",1
"To deal with the prohibitive complexity of calculating policies in Decentralized MDPs, researchers have proposed models that exploit structured agent interactions. Settings where most agent actions are independent except for few actions that affect the transitions and/or rewards of other agents can be modeled using Event-Driven Interactions with Complex Rewards (EDI-CR). Finding the optimal joint policy can be formulated as an optimization problem. However, existing formulations are too verbose and/or lack optimality guarantees. We propose a compact Mixed Integer Linear Program formulation of EDI-CR instances. The key insight is that most action sequences of a group of agents have the same effect on a given agent. This allows us to treat these sequences similarly and use fewer variables. Experiments show that our formulation is more compact and leads to faster solution times and better solutions than existing formulations.",0
"GNU Prolog is a general-purpose implementation of the Prolog language, which distinguishes itself from most other systems by being, above all else, a native-code compiler which produces standalone executables which don't rely on any byte-code emulator or meta-interpreter. Other aspects which stand out include the explicit organization of the Prolog system as a multipass compiler, where intermediate representations are materialized, in Unix compiler tradition. GNU Prolog also includes an extensible and high-performance finite domain constraint solver, integrated with the Prolog language but implemented using independent lower-level mechanisms. This article discusses the main issues involved in designing and implementing GNU Prolog: requirements, system organization, performance and portability issues as well as its position with respect to other Prolog system implementations and the ISO standardization initiative.",0
"A class of interval-based temporal languages for uniformly representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented. Actions are represented by describing what is true while the action itself is occurring, and plans are constructed by temporally relating actions and world states. The temporal languages are members of the family of Description Logics, which are characterized by high expressivity combined with good computational properties. The subsumption problem for a class of temporal Description Logics is investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given. The basic language TL-F is considered first: it is the composition of a temporal logic TL -- able to express interval temporal networks -- together with the non-temporal logic F -- a Feature Description Logic. It is proven that subsumption in this language is an NP-complete problem. Then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive languages TLU-FU and TL-ALCF. The former adds disjunction both at the temporal and non-temporal sides of the language, the latter extends the non-temporal side with set-valued features (i.e., roles) and a propositionally complete language.",0
"In this paper, we discussed CNF-SAT problem (NP-Complete problem) and analysis two solutions that can solve the problem, the PL-Resolution algorithm and the WalkSAT algorithm. PL-Resolution is a sound and complete algorithm that can be used to determine satisfiability and unsatisfiability with certainty. WalkSAT can determine satisfiability if it finds a model, but it cannot guarantee to find a model even there exists one. However, WalkSAT is much faster than PL-Resolution, which makes WalkSAT more practical; and we have analysis the performance between these two algorithms, and the performance of WalkSAT is acceptable if the problem is not so hard.",0
"This paper presents an analysis of data from a gift-exchange-game experiment. The experiment was described in `The Impact of Social Comparisons on Reciprocity' by G\""achter et al. 2012. Since this paper uses state-of-art data science techniques, the results provide a different point of view on the problem. As already shown in relevant literature from experimental economics, human decisions deviate from rational payoff maximization. The average gift rate was $31$%. Gift rate was under no conditions zero. Further, we derive some special findings and calculate their significance.",0
"Constrained counting is important in domains ranging from artificial intelligence to software analysis. There are already a few approaches for counting models over various types of constraints. Recently, hashing-based approaches achieve both theoretical guarantees and scalability, but still rely on solution enumeration. In this paper, a new probabilistic polynomial time approximate model counter is proposed, which is also a hashing-based universal framework, but with only satisfiability queries. A variant with a dynamic stopping criterion is also presented. Empirical evaluation over benchmarks on propositional logic formulas and SMT(BV) formulas shows that the approach is promising.",0
"Knowledge representation is a popular research field in IT. As mathematical knowledge is most formalized, its representation is important and interesting. Mathematical knowledge consists of various mathematical theories. In this paper we consider a deductive system that derives mathematical notions, axioms and theorems. All these notions, axioms and theorems can be considered as the part of elementary set theory. This theory will be represented as a semantic net.",0
"According to the distributional inclusion hypothesis, entailment between words can be measured via the feature inclusions of their distributional vectors. In recent work, we showed how this hypothesis can be extended from words to phrases and sentences in the setting of compositional distributional semantics. This paper focuses on inclusion properties of tensors; its main contribution is a theoretical and experimental analysis of how feature inclusion works in different concrete models of verb tensors. We present results for relational, Frobenius, projective, and holistic methods and compare them to the simple vector addition, multiplication, min, and max models. The degrees of entailment thus obtained are evaluated via a variety of existing word-based measures, such as Weed's and Clarke's, KL-divergence, APinc, balAPinc, and two of our previously proposed metrics at the phrase/sentence level. We perform experiments on three entailment datasets, investigating which version of tensor-based composition achieves the highest performance when combined with the sentence-level measures.",0
"The amount of digitally available but heterogeneous information about the world is remarkable, and new technologies such as self-driving cars, smart homes or the ""internet of things"" will further increase it. In this paper we examine certain aspects of the problem of how such heterogeneous information can be harnessed by intelligent agents. We first discuss potentials and limitations of some existing approaches, followed by two investigations. The focus of the first investigation is on using the novel experimentation platform {\em Malmo} to obtain a better understanding of the problem. The focus of the second investigation is on understanding how information about the hardware of different agents (such as self-driving cars), the agents' sensory data, and physical or causal information can be utilized for knowledge transfer between agents and subsequent more data-efficient decision making. Finally, we present some thoughts on what a general theory for the problem could look like, and formulate open questions.",0
"The goal of sequence mining is to find sequences of symbols that are included in (i.e. that are subsequences of) a large number of input sequences. Many constraints have been proposed in the literature for this type of problem, but a general framework for handling these constraints is missing. We investigate the use of constraint programming as general framework for this task. We first identify four categories of constraints that are applicable to sequence mining. We then propose two constraint programming formulation: the first formulation introduces a new global constraint called exists embedding that hides the complexity of the inclusion relation. However, this approach does not support one category of constraints. To support such constraints, we develop a second for- mulation that is more general but incurs more overhead. Both formulations can be related to the projected database technique used in specialised algorithms, and can use projected frequency to speed up the search. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility towards constraint-based settings and compare the approach to existing methods. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of a CP-based approach for constrained mining.",0
"Can non-player characters have human-realistic personalities, changing over time depending on input from those around them? And can they have different reactions and thoughts about different people? Using Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine using the Five Factor model of personality, I answer these questions by creating personalities for 100 voters and allowing them to react to two politicians to see if the NPC voters' choice of candidate develops in a realistic-seeming way, based on initial and changing personality facets and on their differing feelings toward the politicians (in this case, across liking, trusting, and feeling affiliated with the candidates). After 16 test runs, the voters did indeed change their attitudes and feelings toward the candidates in different and yet generally realistic ways, and even changed their attitudes about other issues based on what a candidate extolled.",0
"Modern recommender systems model people and items by discovering or `teasing apart' the underlying dimensions that encode the properties of items and users' preferences toward them. Critically, such dimensions are uncovered based on user feedback, often in implicit form (such as purchase histories, browsing logs, etc.); in addition, some recommender systems make use of side information, such as product attributes, temporal information, or review text. However one important feature that is typically ignored by existing personalized recommendation and ranking methods is the visual appearance of the items being considered. In this paper we propose a scalable factorization model to incorporate visual signals into predictors of people's opinions, which we apply to a selection of large, real-world datasets. We make use of visual features extracted from product images using (pre-trained) deep networks, on top of which we learn an additional layer that uncovers the visual dimensions that best explain the variation in people's feedback. This not only leads to significantly more accurate personalized ranking methods, but also helps to alleviate cold start issues, and qualitatively to analyze the visual dimensions that influence people's opinions.",1
"The relationship between belief networks and relational databases is examined. Based on this analysis, a method to construct belief networks automatically from statistical relational data is proposed. A comparison between our method and other methods shows that our method has several advantages when generalization or prediction is deeded.",0
"In this work we describe and evaluate methods to learn musical embeddings. Each embedding is a vector that represents four contiguous beats of music and is derived from a symbolic representation. We consider autoencoding-based methods including denoising autoencoders, and context reconstruction, and evaluate the resulting embeddings on a forward prediction and a classification task.",0
"The common internal structure and algorithmic organization of object detection, detection-based tracking, and event recognition facilitates a general approach to integrating these three components. This supports multidirectional information flow between these components allowing object detection to influence tracking and event recognition and event recognition to influence tracking and object detection. The performance of the combination can exceed the performance of the components in isolation. This can be done with linear asymptotic complexity.",0
Dealing with sparse rewards is one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum.,1
"This paper studies the off-policy evaluation problem, where one aims to estimate the value of a target policy based on a sample of observations collected by another policy. We first consider the multi-armed bandit case, establish a minimax risk lower bound, and analyze the risk of two standard estimators. It is shown, and verified in simulation, that one is minimax optimal up to a constant, while another can be arbitrarily worse, despite its empirical success and popularity. The results are applied to related problems in contextual bandits and fixed-horizon Markov decision processes, and are also related to semi-supervised learning.",0
In this article we present an elitism levels traverse mechanism that we designed to find bounds on population-based Evolutionary algorithms solving unimodal functions. We prove its efficiency theoretically and test it on OneMax function deriving bounds c{\mu}n log n - O({\mu} n). This analysis can be generalized to any similar algorithm using variants of tournament selection and genetic operators that flip or swap only 1 bit in each string.,0
"Some aspects of the result of applying unit resolution on a CNF formula can be formalized as functions with domain a set of partial truth assignments. We are interested in two ways for computing such functions, depending on whether the result is the production of the empty clause or the assignment of a variable with a given truth value. We show that these two models can compute the same functions with formulae of polynomially related sizes, and we explain how this result is related to the CNF encoding of Boolean constraints.",0
"Computational Grids are a new trend in distributed computing systems. They allow the sharing of geographically distributed resources in an efficient way, extending the boundaries of what we perceive as distributed computing. Various sciences can benefit from the use of grids to solve CPU-intensive problems, creating potential benefits to the entire society. Job scheduling is an integrated part of parallel and distributed computing. It allows selecting correct match of resource for a particular job and thus increases the job throughput and utilization of resources. Job should be scheduled in an automatic way to make the system more reliable, accessible and less sensitive to subsystem failures. This paper provides a survey on various heuristic algorithms, used for scheduling in grid.",0
"The main problems of school course timetabling are time, curriculum, and classrooms. In addition there are other problems that vary from one institution to another. This paper is intended to solve the problem of satisfying the teachers preferred schedule in a way that regards the importance of the teacher to the supervising institute, i.e. his score according to some criteria. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been presented as an elegant method in solving timetable problem (TTP) in order to produce solutions with no conflict. In this paper, we consider the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to efficiently obtain a score for each teacher, and consequently produce a GA-based TTP solution that satisfies most of the teachers preferences.",0
"We present algorithms for generating alternative solutions for explicit acyclic AND/OR structures in non-decreasing order of cost. The proposed algorithms use a best first search technique and report the solutions using an implicit representation ordered by cost. In this paper, we present two versions of the search algorithm -- (a) an initial version of the best first search algorithm, ASG, which may present one solution more than once while generating the ordered solutions, and (b) another version, LASG, which avoids the construction of the duplicate solutions. The actual solutions can be reconstructed quickly from the implicit compact representation used. We have applied the methods on a few test domains, some of them are synthetic while the others are based on well known problems including the search space of the 5-peg Tower of Hanoi problem, the matrix-chain multiplication problem and the problem of finding secondary structure of RNA. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the existing approach. Our proposed algorithms have potential use in various domains ranging from knowledge based frameworks to service composition, where the AND/OR structure is widely used for representing problems.",0
"This research introduces a new constraint domain for reasoning about data with uncertainty. It extends convex modeling with the notion of p-box to gain additional quantifiable information on the data whereabouts. Unlike existing approaches, the p-box envelops an unknown probability instead of approximating its representation. The p-box bounds are uniform cumulative distribution functions (cdf) in order to employ linear computations in the probabilistic domain. The reasoning by means of p-box cdf-intervals is an interval computation which is exerted on the real domain then it is projected onto the cdf domain. This operation conveys additional knowledge represented by the obtained probabilistic bounds. Empirical evaluation shows that, with minimal overhead, the output solution set realizes a full enclosure of the data along with tighter bounds on its probabilistic distributions.",0
"This short paper concerns discretization schemes for representing and computing approximate Nash equilibria, with emphasis on graphical games, but briefly touching on normal-form and poly-matrix games. The main technical contribution is a representation theorem that informally states that to account for every exact Nash equilibrium using a nearby approximate Nash equilibrium on a grid over mixed strategies, a uniform discretization size linear on the inverse of the approximation quality and natural game-representation parameters suffices. For graphical games, under natural conditions, the discretization is logarithmic in the game-representation size, a substantial improvement over the linear dependency previously required. The paper has five other objectives: (1) given the venue, to highlight the important, but often ignored, role that work on constraint networks in AI has in simplifying the derivation and analysis of algorithms for computing approximate Nash equilibria; (2) to summarize the state-of-the-art on computing approximate Nash equilibria, with emphasis on relevance to graphical games; (3) to help clarify the distinction between sparse-discretization and sparse-support techniques; (4) to illustrate and advocate for the deliberate mathematical simplicity of the formal proof of the representation theorem; and (5) to list and discuss important open problems, emphasizing graphical-game generalizations, which the AI community is most suitable to solve.",0
"This note revisits the concepts of task and difficulty. The notion of cognitive task and its use for the evaluation of intelligent systems is still replete with issues. The view of tasks as MDP in the context of reinforcement learning has been especially useful for the formalisation of learning tasks. However, this alternate interaction does not accommodate well for some other tasks that are usual in artificial intelligence and, most especially, in animal and human evaluation. In particular, we want to have a more general account of episodes, rewards and responses, and, most especially, the computational complexity of the algorithm behind an agent solving a task. This is crucial for the determination of the difficulty of a task as the (logarithm of the) number of computational steps required to acquire an acceptable policy for the task, which includes the exploration of policies and their verification. We introduce a notion of asynchronous-time stochastic tasks. Based on this interpretation, we can see what task difficulty is, what instance difficulty is (relative to a task) and also what task compositions and decompositions are.",0
"The fastest known exact algorithms for scorebased structure discovery in Bayesian networks on n nodes run in time and space 2nnO(1). The usage of these algorithms is limited to networks on at most around 25 nodes mainly due to the space requirement. Here, we study space-time tradeoffs for finding an optimal network structure. When little space is available, we apply the Gurevich-Shelah recurrence-originally proposed for the Hamiltonian path problem-and obtain time 22n-snO(1) in space 2snO(1) for any s = n/2, n/4, n/8, . . .; we assume the indegree of each node is bounded by a constant. For the more practical setting with moderate amounts of space, we present a novel scheme. It yields running time 2n(3/2)pnO(1) in space 2n(3/4)pnO(1) for any p = 0, 1, . . ., n/2; these bounds hold as long as the indegrees are at most 0.238n. Furthermore, the latter scheme allows easy and efficient parallelization beyond previous algorithms. We also explore empirically the potential of the presented techniques.",0
"This paper describes an application of Bayesian programming to the control of an autonomous avatar in a multiplayer role-playing game (the example is based on World of Warcraft). We model a particular task, which consists of choosing what to do and to select which target in a situation where allies and foes are present. We explain the model in Bayesian programming and show how we could learn the conditional probabilities from data gathered during human-played sessions.",0
"In this work, we present and analyze reported failures of artificially intelligent systems and extrapolate our analysis to future AIs. We suggest that both the frequency and the seriousness of future AI failures will steadily increase. AI Safety can be improved based on ideas developed by cybersecurity experts. For narrow AIs safety failures are at the same, moderate, level of criticality as in cybersecurity, however for general AI, failures have a fundamentally different impact. A single failure of a superintelligent system may cause a catastrophic event without a chance for recovery. The goal of cybersecurity is to reduce the number of successful attacks on the system; the goal of AI Safety is to make sure zero attacks succeed in bypassing the safety mechanisms. Unfortunately, such a level of performance is unachievable. Every security system will eventually fail; there is no such thing as a 100% secure system.",0
"Latent variable models have accumulated a considerable amount of interest from the industry and academia for their versatility in a wide range of applications. A large amount of effort has been made to develop systems that is able to extend the systems to a large scale, in the hope to make use of them on industry scale data. In this paper, we describe a system that operates at a scale orders of magnitude higher than previous works, and an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art system at the same scale, at the same time showing more robustness and more accurate results.",0
"The World Wide Web (WWW) allows the people to share the information (data) from the large database repositories globally. The amount of information grows billions of databases. We need to search the information will specialize tools known generically search engine. There are many of search engines available today, retrieving meaningful information is difficult. However to overcome this problem in search engines to retrieve meaningful information intelligently, semantic web technologies are playing a major role. In this paper we present survey on the search engine generations and the role of search engines in intelligent web and semantic search technologies.",0
"ExtractingMUCs(MinimalUnsatisfiableCores)fromanunsatisfiable constraint network is a useful process when causes of unsatisfiability must be understood so that the network can be re-engineered and relaxed to become sat- isfiable. Despite bad worst-case computational complexity results, various MUC- finding approaches that appear tractable for many real-life instances have been proposed. Many of them are based on the successive identification of so-called transition constraints. In this respect, we show how local search can be used to possibly extract additional transition constraints at each main iteration step. The approach is shown to outperform a technique based on a form of model rotation imported from the SAT-related technology and that also exhibits additional transi- tion constraints. Our extensive computational experimentations show that this en- hancement also boosts the performance of state-of-the-art DC(WCORE)-like MUC extractors.",0
"Usually bilingual word vectors are trained ""online"". Mikolov et al. showed they can also be found ""offline"", whereby two pre-trained embeddings are aligned with a linear transformation, using dictionaries compiled from expert knowledge. In this work, we prove that the linear transformation between two spaces should be orthogonal. This transformation can be obtained using the singular value decomposition. We introduce a novel ""inverted softmax"" for identifying translation pairs, with which we improve the precision @1 of Mikolov's original mapping from 34% to 43%, when translating a test set composed of both common and rare English words into Italian. Orthogonal transformations are more robust to noise, enabling us to learn the transformation without expert bilingual signal by constructing a ""pseudo-dictionary"" from the identical character strings which appear in both languages, achieving 40% precision on the same test set. Finally, we extend our method to retrieve the true translations of English sentences from a corpus of 200k Italian sentences with a precision @1 of 68%.",1
"Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) form a useful tool for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing environments such as road networks and office buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here is concerned with acquiring such models. We demonstrate how domain-specific information and constraints can be incorporated into the statistical estimation process, greatly improving the learned models in terms of the model quality, the number of iterations required for convergence and robustness to reduction in the amount of available data. We present new initialization heuristics which can be used even when the data suffers from cumulative rotational error, new update rules for the model parameters, as an instance of generalized EM, and a strategy for enforcing complete geometrical consistency in the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for both simulated and real robot data, in traditionally hard-to-learn environments.",0
"Relational representations in reinforcement learning allow for the use of structural information like the presence of objects and relationships between them in the description of value functions. Through this paper, we show that such representations allow for the inclusion of background knowledge that qualitatively describes a state and can be used to design agents that demonstrate learning behavior in domains with large state and actions spaces such as computer games.",1
"Information discounting plays an important role in the theory of belief functions and, generally, in information fusion. Nevertheless, neither classical uniform discounting nor contextual cannot model certain use cases, notably temporal discounting. In this article, new contextual discounting schemes, conservative, proportional and optimistic, are proposed. Some properties of these discounting operations are examined. Classical discounting is shown to be a special case of these schemes. Two motivating cases are discussed: modelling of source reliability and application to temporal discounting.",0
"Local consistency techniques such as k-consistency are a key component of specialised solvers for constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper we show that the power of using k-consistency techniques on a constraint satisfaction problem is precisely captured by using a particular inference rule, which we call negative-hyper-resolution, on the standard direct encoding of the problem into Boolean clauses. We also show that current clause-learning SAT-solvers will discover in expected polynomial time any inconsistency that can be deduced from a given set of clauses using negative-hyper-resolvents of a fixed size. We combine these two results to show that, without being explicitly designed to do so, current clause-learning SAT-solvers efficiently simulate k-consistency techniques, for all fixed values of k. We then give some experimental results to show that this feature allows clause-learning SAT-solvers to efficiently solve certain families of constraint problems which are challenging for conventional constraint-programming solvers.",0
"We present a new system S for handling uncertainty in a quantified modal logic (first-order modal logic). The system is based on both probability theory and proof theory. The system is derived from Chisholm's epistemology. We concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive (i.e. foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can be useful in systems that have to interact with humans and provide justifications for their uncertainty. As a demonstration of the system, we apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values for counterfactual statements. Counterfactuals are statements that an agent knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals are useful when systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for counterfactuals fall out naturally from our system.",0
"Computational analysis of time-course data with an underlying causal structure is needed in a variety of domains, including neural spike trains, stock price movements, and gene expression levels. However, it can be challenging to determine from just the numerical time course data alone what is coordinating the visible processes, to separate the underlying prima facie causes into genuine and spurious causes and to do so with a feasible computational complexity. For this purpose, we have been developing a novel algorithm based on a framework that combines notions of causality in philosophy with algorithmic approaches built on model checking and statistical techniques for multiple hypotheses testing. The causal relationships are described in terms of temporal logic formulae, reframing the inference problem in terms of model checking. The logic used, PCTL, allows description of both the time between cause and effect and the probability of this relationship being observed. We show that equipped with these causal formulae with their associated probabilities we may compute the average impact a cause makes to its effect and then discover statistically significant causes through the concepts of multiple hypothesis testing (treating each causal relationship as a hypothesis), and false discovery control. By exploring a well-chosen family of potentially all significant hypotheses with reasonably minimal description length, it is possible to tame the algorithm's computational complexity while exploring the nearly complete search-space of all prima facie causes. We have tested these ideas in a number of domains and illustrate them here with two examples.",0
"This paper discusses an interested party who wishes to influence the behavior of agents in a game (multi-agent interaction), which is not under his control. The interested party cannot design a new game, cannot enforce agents' behavior, cannot enforce payments by the agents, and cannot prohibit strategies available to the agents. However, he can influence the outcome of the game by committing to non-negative monetary transfers for the different strategy profiles that may be selected by the agents. The interested party assumes that agents are rational in the commonly agreed sense that they do not use dominated strategies. Hence, a certain subset of outcomes is implemented in a given game if by adding non-negative payments, rational players will necessarily produce an outcome in this subset. Obviously, by making sufficiently big payments one can implement any desirable outcome. The question is what is the cost of implementation? In this paper we introduce the notion of k-implementation of a desired set of strategy profiles, where k stands for the amount of payment that need to be actually made in order to implement desirable outcomes. A major point in k-implementation is that monetary offers need not necessarily materialize when following desired behaviors. We define and study k-implementation in the contexts of games with complete and incomplete information. In the latter case we mainly focus on the VCG games. Our setting is later extended to deal with mixed strategies using correlation devices. Together, the paper introduces and studies the implementation of desirable outcomes by a reliable party who cannot modify game rules (i.e. provide protocols), complementing previous work in mechanism design, while making it more applicable to many realistic CS settings.",0
"Scene understanding includes many related sub-tasks, such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection, etc. Each of these sub-tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classifiers already exist for many of them. These classifiers operate on the same raw image and provide correlated outputs. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring any changes to the inner workings of any classifier.",1
"Upcoming many core processors are expected to employ a distributed memory architecture similar to currently available supercomputers, but parallel pattern mining algorithms amenable to the architecture are not comprehensively studied. We present a novel closed pattern mining algorithm with a well-engineered communication protocol, and generalize it to find statistically significant patterns from personal genome data. For distributing communication evenly, it employs global load balancing with multiple stacks distributed on a set of cores organized as a hypercube with random edges. Our algorithm achieved up to 1175-fold speedup by using 1200 cores for solving a problem with 11,914 items and 697 transactions, while the naive approach of separating the search space failed completely.",0
"We take another look at the general problem of selecting a preferred probability measure among those that comply with some given constraints. The dominant role that entropy maximization has obtained in this context is questioned by arguing that the minimum information principle on which it is based could be supplanted by an at least as plausible ""likelihood of evidence"" principle. We then review a method for turning given selection functions into representation independent variants, and discuss the tradeoffs involved in this transformation.",0
"Combinatorial evolution and forecasting of system requirements is examined. The morphological model is used for a hierarchical requirements system (i.e., system parts, design alternatives for the system parts, ordinal estimates for the alternatives). A set of system changes involves changes of the system structure, component alternatives and their estimates. The composition process of the forecast is based on combinatorial synthesis (knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, hierarchical morphological design). An illustrative numerical example for four-phase evolution and forecasting of requirements to communications is described.",0
"When a system behaves abnormally, sequential diagnosis takes a sequence of measurements of the system until the faults causing the abnormality are identified, and the goal is to reduce the diagnostic cost, defined here as the number of measurements. To propose measurement points, previous work employs a heuristic based on reducing the entropy over a computed set of diagnoses. This approach generally has good performance in terms of diagnostic cost, but can fail to diagnose large systems when the set of diagnoses is too large. Focusing on a smaller set of probable diagnoses scales the approach but generally leads to increased average diagnostic costs. In this paper, we propose a new diagnostic framework employing four new techniques, which scales to much larger systems with good performance in terms of diagnostic cost. First, we propose a new heuristic for measurement point selection that can be computed efficiently, without requiring the set of diagnoses, once the system is modeled as a Bayesian network and compiled into a logical form known as d-DNNF. Second, we extend hierarchical diagnosis, a technique based on system abstraction from our previous work, to handle probabilities so that it can be applied to sequential diagnosis to allow larger systems to be diagnosed. Third, for the largest systems where even hierarchical diagnosis fails, we propose a novel method that converts the system into one that has a smaller abstraction and whose diagnoses form a superset of those of the original system; the new system can then be diagnosed and the result mapped back to the original system. Finally, we propose a novel cost estimation function which can be used to choose an abstraction of the system that is more likely to provide optimal average cost. Experiments with ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits indicate that our approach scales to all circuits in the suite except one that has a flat structure not susceptible to useful abstraction.",0
"The Android operating system has become the most popular operating system for smartphones and tablets leading to a rapid rise in malware. Sophisticated Android malware employ detection avoidance techniques in order to hide their malicious activities from analysis tools. These include a wide range of anti-emulator techniques, where the malware programs attempt to hide their malicious activities by detecting the emulator. For this reason, countermeasures against antiemulation are becoming increasingly important in Android malware detection. Analysis and detection based on real devices can alleviate the problems of anti-emulation as well as improve the effectiveness of dynamic analysis. Hence, in this paper we present an investigation of machine learning based malware detection using dynamic analysis on real devices. A tool is implemented to automatically extract dynamic features from Android phones and through several experiments, a comparative analysis of emulator based vs. device based detection by means of several machine learning algorithms is undertaken. Our study shows that several features could be extracted more effectively from the on-device dynamic analysis compared to emulators. It was also found that approximately 24% more apps were successfully analysed on the phone. Furthermore, all of the studied machine learning based detection performed better when applied to features extracted from the on-device dynamic analysis.",0
"As Wireless Sensor Networks are penetrating into the industrial domain, many research opportunities are emerging. One such essential and challenging application is that of node localization. A feed-forward neural network based methodology is adopted in this paper. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of the anchor node beacons are used. The number of anchor nodes and their configurations has an impact on the accuracy of the localization system, which is also addressed in this paper. Five different training algorithms are evaluated to find the training algorithm that gives the best result. The multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was trained using Matlab. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real time, the model obtained was then implemented on the Arduino microcontroller. With four anchor nodes, an average 2D localization error of 0.2953 m has been achieved with a 12-12-2 neural network structure. The proposed method can also be implemented on any other embedded microcontroller system.",0
"Many real-world phenomena can be modelled as dynamic optimization problems. In such cases, the environment problem changes dynamically and therefore, conventional methods are not capable of dealing with such problems. In this paper, a novel multi-swarm cellular particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed by clustering and local search. In the proposed algorithm, the search space is partitioned into cells, while the particles identify changes in the search space and form clusters to create sub-swarms. Then a local search is applied to improve the solutions in the each cell. Simulation results for static standard benchmarks and dynamic environments show superiority of the proposed method over other alternative approaches.",0
"An efficient policy search algorithm should estimate the local gradient of the objective function, with respect to the policy parameters, from as few trials as possible. Whereas most policy search methods estimate this gradient by observing the rewards obtained during policy trials, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that taking into account the sensor data as well gives better gradient estimates and hence faster learning. The reason is that rewards obtained during policy execution vary from trial to trial due to noise in the environment; sensor data, which correlates with the noise, can be used to partially correct for this variation, resulting in an estimatorwith lower variance.",0
"CHRONIOUS is an Open, Ubiquitous and Adaptive Chronic Disease Management Platform for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Renal Insufficiency. It consists of several modules: an ontology based literature search engine, a rule based decision support system, remote sensors interacting with lifestyle interfaces (PDA, monitor touchscreen) and a machine learning module. All these modules interact each other to allow the monitoring of two types of chronic diseases and to help clinician in taking decision for cure purpose. This paper illustrates how some machine learning algorithms and a rule based decision support system can be used in smart devices, to monitor chronic patient. We will analyse how a set of machine learning algorithms can be used in smart devices to alert the clinician in case of a patient health condition worsening trend.",0
"We describe and evaluate a novel optimization-based off-line path planning algorithm for mobile robots based on the Counterexample-Guided Inductive Optimization (CEGIO) technique. CEGIO iteratively employs counterexamples generated from Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers, in order to guide the optimization process and to ensure global optimization. This paper marks the first application of CEGIO for planning mobile robot path. In particular, CEGIO has been successfully applied to obtain optimal two-dimensional paths for autonomous mobile robots using off-the-shelf SAT and SMT solvers.",0
"The LCF tradition of interactive theorem proving, which was started by Milner in the 1970-ies, appears to be tied to the classic READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP of sequential and synchronous evaluation of prover commands. We break up this loop and retrofit the read-eval-print phases into a model of parallel and asynchronous proof processing. Thus we explain some key concepts of the Isabelle/Scala approach to prover interaction and integration, and the Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE as front-end technology. We hope to open up the scientific discussion about non-trivial interaction models for ITP systems again, and help getting other old-school proof assistants on a similar track.",0
"Solving symmetric Bayesian decision problems is a computationally intensive task to perform regardless of the algorithm used. In this paper we propose a method for improving the efficiency of algorithms for solving Bayesian decision problems. The method is based on the principle of lazy evaluation - a principle recently shown to improve the efficiency of inference in Bayesian networks. The basic idea is to maintain decompositions of potentials and to postpone computations for as long as possible. The efficiency improvements obtained with the lazy evaluation based method is emphasized through examples. Finally, the lazy evaluation based method is compared with the hugin and valuation-based systems architectures for solving symmetric Bayesian decision problems.",0
"An RDF data shape is a description of the expected contents of an RDF document (aka graph) or dataset. A major part of this description is the set of constraints that the document or dataset is required to satisfy. W3C recently (2014) chartered the RDF Data Shapes Working Group to define SHACL, a standard RDF data shape language. We refer to the ability to name and reference shape language elements as recursion. This article provides a precise definition of the meaning of recursion as used in Resource Shape 2.0. The definition of recursion presented in this article is largely independent of language-specific details. We speculate that it also applies to ShEx and to all three of the current proposals for SHACL. In particular, recursion is not permitted in the SHACL-SPARQL proposal, but we conjecture that recursion could be added by using the definition proposed here as a top-level control structure.",0
"Local Process Model (LPM) discovery is focused on the mining of a set of process models where each model describes the behavior represented in the event log only partially, i.e. subsets of possible events are taken into account to create so-called local process models. Often such smaller models provide valuable insights into the behavior of the process, especially when no adequate and comprehensible single overall process model exists that is able to describe the traces of the process from start to end. The practical application of LPM discovery is however hindered by computational issues in the case of logs with many activities (problems may already occur when there are more than 17 unique activities). In this paper, we explore three heuristics to discover subsets of activities that lead to useful log projections with the goal of speeding up LPM discovery considerably while still finding high-quality LPMs. We found that a Markov clustering approach to create projection sets results in the largest improvement of execution time, with discovered LPMs still being better than with the use of randomly generated activity sets of the same size. Another heuristic, based on log entropy, yields a more moderate speedup, but enables the discovery of higher quality LPMs. The third heuristic, based on the relative information gain, shows unstable performance: for some data sets the speedup and LPM quality are higher than with the log entropy based method, while for other data sets there is no speedup at all.",0
"The ability to reason under uncertainty and with incomplete information is a fundamental requirement of decision support technology. In this paper we argue that the concentration on theoretical techniques for the evaluation and selection of decision options has distracted attention from many of the wider issues in decision making. Although numerical methods of reasoning under uncertainty have strong theoretical foundations, they are representationally weak and only deal with a small part of the decision process. Knowledge based systems, on the other hand, offer greater flexibility but have not been accompanied by a clear decision theory. We describe here work which is under way towards providing a theoretical framework for symbolic decision procedures. A central proposal is an extended form of inference which we call argumentation; reasoning for and against decision options from generalised domain theories. The approach has been successfully used in several decision support applications, but it is argued that a comprehensive decision theory must cover autonomous decision making, where the agent can formulate questions as well as take decisions. A major theoretical challenge for this theory is to capture the idea of reflection to permit decision agents to reason about their goals, what they believe and why, and what they need to know or do in order to achieve their goals.",0
"PDM Systems contain and manage heavy amount of data but the search mechanism of most of the systems is not intelligent which can process user""s natural language based queries to extract desired information. Currently available search mechanisms in almost all of the PDM systems are not very efficient and based on old ways of searching information by entering the relevant information to the respective fields of search forms to find out some specific information from attached repositories. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in fields of PDM Systems and Language Technology. Concerning the PDM System, conducted research provides the information about PDM and PDM Systems in detail. Concerning the field of Language Technology, helps in implementing a search mechanism for PDM Systems to search user""s needed information by analyzing user""s natural language based requests. The accomplished goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a new proposition of a conceptual model for the implementation of natural language based search. The proposed conceptual model is successfully designed and partially implementation in the form of a prototype. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept, implementation designs and developed prototype of proposed approach is discussed in this paper. Implemented prototype is compared with respective functions of existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness against targeted challenges.",0
"The BusPlus project aims at improving the off-peak hours public transit service in Canberra, Australia. To address the difficulty of covering a large geographic area, BusPlus proposes a hub and shuttle model consisting of a combination of a few high-frequency bus routes between key hubs and a large number of shuttles that bring passengers from their origin to the closest hub and take them from their last bus stop to their destination. This paper focuses on the design of bus network and proposes an efficient solving method to this multimodal network design problem based on the Benders decomposition method. Starting from a MIP formulation of the problem, the paper presents a Benders decomposition approach using dedicated solution techniques for solving independent sub-problems, Pareto optimal cuts, cut bundling, and core point update. Computational results on real-world data from Canberra's public transit system justify the design choices and show that the approach outperforms the MIP formulation by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the results show that the hub and shuttle model may decrease transit time by a factor of 2, while staying within the costs of the existing transit system.",0
"Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of automated sequential decision making, and has been addressed by researchers in many different fields, including AI planning, decision analysis, operations research, control theory and economics. While the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory. This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods, showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal or approximately optimal policies or plans. Planning problems commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations. Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting these various forms of structure. Certain AI techniques -- in particular those based on the use of structured, intensional representations -- can be viewed in this way. This paper surveys several types of representations for both classical and decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease the computational burden of constructing policies or plans. It focuses primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques based on AI-style representations.",0
"Refinement is a powerful mechanism for mastering the complexities that arise when formally modelling systems. Refinement also brings with it additional proof obligations -- requiring a developer to discover properties relating to their design decisions. With the goal of reducing this burden, we have investigated how a general purpose theory formation tool, HR, can be used to automate the discovery of such properties within the context of Event-B. Here we develop a heuristic approach to the automatic discovery of invariants and report upon a series of experiments that we undertook in order to evaluate our approach. The set of heuristics developed provides systematic guidance in tailoring HR for a given Event-B development. These heuristics are based upon proof-failure analysis, and have given rise to some promising results.",0
"As artificial agents proliferate, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that their interactions with one another are well-behaved. In this paper, we formalize a common-sense notion of when algorithms are well-behaved: an algorithm is safe if it does no harm. Motivated by recent progress in deep learning, we focus on the specific case where agents update their actions according to gradient descent. The first result is that gradient descent converges to a Nash equilibrium in safe games.",1
"Machine-part cell formation is used in cellular manufacturing in order to process a large variety, quality, lower work in process levels, reducing manufacturing lead-time and customer response time while retaining flexibility for new products. This paper presents a new and novel approach for obtaining machine cells and part families. In the cellular manufacturing the fundamental problem is the formation of part families and machine cells. The present paper deals with the Self Organising Map (SOM) method an unsupervised learning algorithm in Artificial Intelligence, and has been used as a visually decipherable clustering tool of machine-part cell formation. The objective of the paper is to cluster the binary machine-part matrix through visually decipherable cluster of SOM color-coding and labelling via the SOM map nodes in such a way that the part families are processed in that machine cells. The Umatrix, component plane, principal component projection, scatter plot and histogram of SOM have been reported in the present work for the successful visualization of the machine-part cell formation. Computational result with the proposed algorithm on a set of group technology problems available in the literature is also presented. The proposed SOM approach produced solutions with a grouping efficacy that is at least as good as any results earlier reported in the literature and improved the grouping efficacy for 70% of the problems and found immensely useful to both industry practitioners and researchers.",0
"Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 1MB (461x smaller than AlexNet).",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a trending field of research, showing great promise in challenging problems such as playing Atari, solving Go and controlling robots. While DRL agents perform well in practice we are still lacking the tools to analayze their performance. In this work we present the Semi-Aggregated MDP (SAMDP) model. A model best suited to describe policies exhibiting both spatial and temporal hierarchies. We describe its advantages for analyzing trained policies over other modeling approaches, and show that under the right state representation, like that of DQN agents, SAMDP can help to identify skills. We detail the automatic process of creating it from recorded trajectories, up to presenting it on t-SNE maps. We explain how to evaluate its fitness and show surprising results indicating high compatibility with the policy at hand. We conclude by showing how using the SAMDP model, an extra performance gain can be squeezed from the agent.",0
"Existing methods for dealing with knowledge updates differ greatly depending on the underlying knowledge representation formalism. When Classical Logic is used, updates are typically performed by manipulating the knowledge base on the model-theoretic level. On the opposite side of the spectrum stand the semantics for updating Answer-Set Programs that need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a unifying perspective that could embrace both these branches of research is of great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and further development.",0
"Dung's abstract argumentation framework consists of a set of interacting arguments and a series of semantics for evaluating them. Those semantics partition the powerset of the set of arguments into two classes: extensions and non-extensions. In order to reason with a specific semantics, one needs to take a credulous or skeptical approach, i.e. an argument is eventually accepted, if it is accepted in one or all extensions, respectively. In our previous work \cite{ref-pu2015counting}, we have proposed a novel semantics, called \emph{counting semantics}, which allows for a more fine-grained assessment to arguments by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders based on argument graph and argument game. In this paper, we continue our previous work by presenting some supplementaries about how to choose the damaging factor for the counting semantics, and what relationships with some existing approaches, such as Dung's classical semantics, generic gradual valuations. Lastly, an axiomatic perspective on the ranking semantics induced by our counting semantics are presented.",0
"Frequent itemset mining is an essential part of data analysis and data mining. Recent works propose interesting SAT-based encodings for the problem of discovering frequent itemsets. Our aim in this work is to define strategies for adapting SAT solvers to such encodings in order to improve models enumeration. In this context, we deeply study the effects of restart, branching heuristics and clauses learning. We then conduct an experimental evaluation on SAT-Based itemset mining instances to show how SAT solvers can be adapted to obtain an efficient SAT model enumerator.",0
"In this paper, we propose to use deep policy networks which are trained with an advantage actor-critic method for statistically optimised dialogue systems. First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.",0
"Useless paths are a chronic problem for marker-passing techniques. We use a probabilistic analysis to justify a method for quickly identifying and rejecting useless paths. Using the same analysis, we identify key conditions and assumptions necessary for marker-passing to perform well.",0
"This paper presents an idea of inductive learning use for rule generation from ontologies. The main purpose of the paper is to evaluate the possibility of inductive learning use in rule generation from ontologies and to develop the way how this can be done. Generated rules are necessary to supplement or even to develop the Semantic Web Expert System (SWES) knowledge base. The SWES emerges as the result of evolution of expert system concept toward the Web, and the SWES is based on the Semantic Web technologies. Available publications show that the problem of rule generation from ontologies based on inductive learning is not investigated deeply enough.",0
"It has been quite a long time since AI researchers in the field of computer science stop talking about simulating human intelligence or trying to explain how brain works. Recently, represented by deep learning techniques, the field of machine learning is experiencing unprecedented prosperity and some applications with near human-level performance bring researchers confidence to imply that their approaches are the promising candidate for understanding the mechanism of human brain. However apart from several ancient philological criteria and some imaginary black box tests (Turing test, Chinese room) there is no computational level explanation, definition or criteria about intelligence or any of its components. Base on the common sense that learning ability is one critical component of intelligence and inspect from the viewpoint of mapping relations, this paper presents two laws which explains what is the ""learning ability"" as we familiar with and under what conditions a mapping relation can be acknowledged as ""Learning Model"".",0
"In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to identify noun sense changes based on rigorous analysis of time-varying text data available in the form of millions of digitized books. We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet. Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet. Our approach can be applied for lexicography, as well as for applications like word sense disambiguation or semantic search.",1
"Traffic regulation must be respected by all vehicles, either human- or computer- driven. However, extreme traffic situations might exhibit practical cases in which a vehicle should safely and reasonably relax traffic regulation, e.g., in order not to be indefinitely blocked and to keep circulating. In this paper, we propose a high-level representation of an automated vehicle, other vehicles and their environment, which can assist drivers in taking such ""illegal"" but practical relaxation decisions. This high-level representation (an ontology) includes topological knowledge and inference rules, in order to compute the next high-level motion an automated vehicle should take, as assistance to a driver. Results on practical cases are presented.",0
"We present a new preprocessing algorithm for embedding the nodes of a given edge-weighted undirected graph into a Euclidean space. In this space, the Euclidean distance between any two nodes approximates the length of the shortest path between them in the given graph. Later, at runtime, a shortest path between any two nodes can be computed using A* search with the Euclidean distances as heuristic estimates. Our preprocessing algorithm, dubbed FastMap, is inspired by the Data Mining algorithm of the same name and runs in near-linear time. Hence, FastMap is orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches that produce a Euclidean embedding using Semidefinite Programming. Our FastMap algorithm also produces admissible and consistent heuristics and therefore guarantees the generation of optimal paths. Moreover, FastMap works on general undirected graphs for which many traditional heuristics, such as the Manhattan Distance heuristic, are not always well defined. Empirically too, we demonstrate that the FastMap heuristic is competitive with other state-of-the-art heuristics like the Differential heuristic.",0
"We propose and investigate a semantics for ""peer data exchange systems"" where different peers are related by data exchange constraints and trust relationships. These two elements plus the data at the peers' sites and their local integrity constraints are made compatible via a semantics that characterizes sets of ""solution instances"" for the peers. They are the intended -possibly virtual- instances for a peer that are obtained through a data repair semantics that we introduce and investigate. The semantically correct answers from a peer to a query, the so-called ""peer consistent answers"", are defined as those answers that are invariant under all its different solution instances. We show that solution instances can be specified as the models of logic programs with a stable model semantics. The repair semantics is based on null values as used in SQL databases, and is also of independent interest for repairs of single databases with respect to integrity constraints.",0
"Software aging is a phenomenon that refers to progressive performance degradation or transient failures or even crashes in long running software systems such as web servers. It mainly occurs due to the deterioration of operating system resource, fragmentation and numerical error accumulation. A primitive method to fight against software aging is software rejuvenation. Software rejuvenation is a proactive fault management technique aimed at cleaning up the system internal state to prevent the occurrence of more severe crash failures in the future. It involves occasionally stopping the running software, cleaning its internal state and restarting it. An optimized schedule for performing the software rejuvenation has to be derived in advance because a long running application could not be put down now and then as it may lead to waste of cost. This paper proposes a method to derive an accurate and optimized schedule for rejuvenation of a web server (Apache) by using Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Feed Forward Neural Network, a variant of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Aging indicators are obtained through experimental setup involving Apache web server and clients, which acts as input to the neural network model. This method is better than existing ones because usage of RBF leads to better accuracy and speed in convergence.",0
"We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training.",0
"Stackelberg security game models and associated computational tools have seen deployment in a number of high-consequence security settings, such as LAX canine patrols and Federal Air Marshal Service. These models focus on isolated systems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system with multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation networks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and, consequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To understand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we investigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders. Unlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender must protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response decision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical investigation of multidefender security games with independent targets, offering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with increasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive to over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler models, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing both in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender. Considering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make use of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply this approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of networks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks. Our analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread determine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.",0
"Top-down and bottom-up theorem proving approaches each have specific advantages and disadvantages. Bottom-up provers profit from strong redundancy control but suffer from the lack of goal-orientation, whereas top-down provers are goal-oriented but often have weak calculi when their proof lengths are considered. In order to integrate both approaches, we try to achieve cooperation between a top-down and a bottom-up prover in two different ways: The first technique aims at supporting a bottom-up with a top-down prover. A top-down prover generates subgoal clauses, they are then processed by a bottom-up prover. The second technique deals with the use of bottom-up generated lemmas in a top-down prover. We apply our concept to the areas of model elimination and superposition. We discuss the ability of our techniques to shorten proofs as well as to reorder the search space in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, in order to identify subgoal clauses and lemmas which are actually relevant for the proof task, we develop methods for a relevancy-based filtering. Experiments with the provers SETHEO and SPASS performed in the problem library TPTP reveal the high potential of our cooperation approaches.",0

"Simulation is widely used to make model-based predictions, but few approaches have attempted this technique in dynamic physical environments of medium to high complexity or in general contexts. After an introduction to the cognitive science concepts from which this work is inspired and the current development in the use of simulation as a decision-making technique, we propose a generic framework based on theory of mind, which allows an agent to reason and perform actions using multiple simulations of automatically created or externally inputted models of the perceived environment. A description of a partial implementation is given, which aims to solve a popular game within the IJCAI2013 AIBirds contest. Results of our approach are presented, in comparison with the competition benchmark. Finally, future developments regarding the framework are discussed.",0
"In this paper we present a model that leverages a bidirectional long short-term memory network to learn word sense disambiguation directly from data. The approach is end-to-end trainable and makes effective use of word order. Further, to improve the robustness of the model we introduce dropword, a regularization technique that randomly removes words from the text. The model is evaluated on two standard datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets, using identical hyperparameter settings.",0
"Time series interpretation aims to provide an explanation of what is observed in terms of its underlying processes. The present work is based on the assumption that common classification-based approaches to time series interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses whose ultimate cause lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm. In this document we propose a new approach to this problem based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize patterns appearing in a time series. The result of the interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy, and explaining what has been observed. A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism. As a promising application domain, the interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of the present approach in comparison with traditional classification-based approaches.",0
"This paper is concerned with graphical criteria that can be used to solve the problem of identifying casual effects from nonexperimental data in a causal Bayesian network structure, i.e., a directed acyclic graph that represents causal relationships. We first review Pearl's work on this topic [Pearl, 1995], in which several useful graphical criteria are presented. Then we present a complete algorithm [Huang and Valtorta, 2006b] for the identifiability problem. By exploiting the completeness of this algorithm, we prove that the three basic do-calculus rules that Pearl presents are complete, in the sense that, if a causal effect is identifiable, there exists a sequence of applications of the rules of the do-calculus that transforms the causal effect formula into a formula that only includes observational quantities.",0
"There is increasing interest within the research community in the design and use of recursive probability models. Although there still remains concern about computational complexity costs and the fact that computing exact solutions can be intractable for many nonrecursive models and impossible in the general case for recursive problems, several research groups are actively developing computational techniques for recursive stochastic languages. We have developed an extension to the traditional lambda-calculus as a framework for families of Turing complete stochastic languages. We have also developed a class of exact inference algorithms based on the traditional reductions of the lambda-calculus. We further propose that using the deBruijn notation (a lambda-calculus notation with nameless dummies) supports effective caching in such systems (caching being an essential component of efficient computation). Finally, our extension to the lambda-calculus offers a foundation and general theory for the construction of recursive stochastic modeling languages as well as promise for effective caching and efficient approximation algorithms for inference.",0
"Unsupervised term weighting schemes, borrowed from information retrieval field, have been widely used for text categorization and the most famous one is tf.idf. The intuition behind idf seems less reasonable for TC task than IR task. In this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency into supervised term weighting schemes and propose a novel icf-based method. The method combines icf and relevance frequency (rf) to weight terms in training dataset. Our experiments have shown that icf-based supervised term weighting scheme is superior to tf.rf and prob-based supervised term weighting schemes and tf.idf based on two widely used datasets, i.e., the unbalanced Reuters-21578 corpus and the balanced 20 Newsgroup corpus. We also present the detailed evaluations of each category of the two datasets among the four term weighting schemes on precision, recall and F1 measure.",0
"Automatic construction of large knowledge graphs (KG) by mining web-scale text datasets has received considerable attention over the last few years, resulting in the construction of several KGs, such as NELL, Google Knowledge Vault, etc. These KGs consist of thousands of predicate-relations (e.g., isPerson, isMayorOf ) and millions of their instances (e.g., (Bill de Blasio, isMayorOf, New York City)). Estimating accuracy of such automatically constructed KGs is a challenging problem due to their size and diversity. Even though crowdsourcing is an obvious choice for such evaluation, the standard single-task crowdsourcing, where each predicate in the KG is evaluated independently, is very expensive and especially problematic if the budget available is limited. We show that such approaches are sub-optimal as they ignore dependencies among various predicates and their instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), where the tasks are created while taking dependencies among predicates and instances into account. We apply this framework in the context of evaluation of large-scale KGs and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.",0
"The recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is one of the most well-known algorithms used in adaptive filtering, system identification and adaptive control. Its popularity is mainly due to its fast convergence speed, which is considered to be optimal in practice. In this paper, RLS methods are used to solve reinforcement learning problems, where two new reinforcement learning algorithms using linear value function approximators are proposed and analyzed. The two algorithms are called RLS-TD(lambda) and Fast-AHC (Fast Adaptive Heuristic Critic), respectively. RLS-TD(lambda) can be viewed as the extension of RLS-TD(0) from lambda=0 to general lambda within interval [0,1], so it is a multi-step temporal-difference (TD) learning algorithm using RLS methods. The convergence with probability one and the limit of convergence of RLS-TD(lambda) are proved for ergodic Markov chains. Compared to the existing LS-TD(lambda) algorithm, RLS-TD(lambda) has advantages in computation and is more suitable for online learning. The effectiveness of RLS-TD(lambda) is analyzed and verified by learning prediction experiments of Markov chains with a wide range of parameter settings. The Fast-AHC algorithm is derived by applying the proposed RLS-TD(lambda) algorithm in the critic network of the adaptive heuristic critic method. Unlike conventional AHC algorithm, Fast-AHC makes use of RLS methods to improve the learning-prediction efficiency in the critic. Learning control experiments of the cart-pole balancing and the acrobot swing-up problems are conducted to compare the data efficiency of Fast-AHC with conventional AHC. From the experimental results, it is shown that the data efficiency of learning control can also be improved by using RLS methods in the learning-prediction process of the critic. The performance of Fast-AHC is also compared with that of the AHC method using LS-TD(lambda). Furthermore, it is demonstrated in the experiments that different initial values of the variance matrix in RLS-TD(lambda) are required to get better performance not only in learning prediction but also in learning control. The experimental results are analyzed based on the existing theoretical work on the transient phase of forgetting factor RLS methods.",0
"This paper considers a general data-fitting problem over a networked system, in which many computing nodes are connected by an undirected graph. This kind of problem can find many real-world applications and has been studied extensively in the literature. However, existing solutions either need a central controller for information sharing or requires slot synchronization among different nodes, which increases the difficulty of practical implementations, especially for a very large and heterogeneous system.",0
In this paper we present a preliminary logic-based evaluation of the integration of post-composed phenotypic descriptions with domain ontologies. The evaluation has been performed using a description logic reasoner together with scalable techniques: ontology modularization and approximations of the logical difference between ontologies.,0
"We study propagation algorithms for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. Solutions of an AllDifferent constraint can be seen as perfect matchings on the variable/value bipartite graph. Therefore, we investigate the problem of finding simultaneous bipartite matchings. We present an extension of the famous Hall theorem which characterizes when simultaneous bipartite matchings exists. Unfortunately, finding such matchings is NP-hard in general. However, we prove a surprising result that finding a simultaneous matching on a convex bipartite graph takes just polynomial time. Based on this theoretical result, we provide the first polynomial time bound consistency algorithm for the conjunction of two AllDifferent constraints. We identify a pathological problem on which this propagator is exponentially faster compared to existing propagators. Our experiments show that this new propagator can offer significant benefits over existing methods.",1
"The decision variable selection policy used by the most competitive CDCL (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) SAT solvers is either VSIDS (Variable State Independent Decaying Sum) or its variants such as exponential version EVSIDS. The common characteristic of VSIDS and its variants is to make use of statistical information in the solving process, but ignore structure information of the problem. For this reason, this paper modifies the decision variable selection policy, and presents a SAT solving technique based on BCD (Blocked Clause Decomposition). Its basic idea is that a part of decision variables are selected by VSIDS heuristic, while another part of decision variables are selected by blocked sets that are obtained by BCD. Compared with the existing BCD-based technique, our technique is simple, and need not to reencode CNF formulas. SAT solvers for certified UNSAT track can apply also our BCD-based technique. Our experiments on application benchmarks demonstrate that the new variables selection policy based on BCD can increase the performance of SAT solvers such as abcdSAT. The solver with BCD solved an instance from the SAT Race 2015 that was not solved by any solver so far. This shows that in some cases, the heuristic based on structure information is more efficient than that based on statistical information.",0
"As manufacturing processes become increasingly automated, so should tool condition monitoring (TCM) as it is impractical to have human workers monitor the state of the tools continuously. Tool condition is crucial to ensure the good quality of products: Worn tools affect not only the surface quality but also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how to learn process without paying attention to other two crucial issues: what to learn, and when to learn. The what to learn and the when to learn provide self regulating mechanisms to select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A novel tool condition monitoring approach based on a psychologically plausible concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built upon a recently published algorithm, recurrent classifier (rClass). The learning process consists of three phases: what to learn, how to learn, when to learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity over its counterparts.",0
"Most data for evaluating and training recommender systems is subject to selection biases, either through self-selection by the users or through the actions of the recommendation system itself. In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handling selection biases, adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, finding that it is highly practical and scalable.",1
"Reasoning does not work well when done in isolation from its significance, both to the needs and interests of an agent and with respect to the wider world. Moreover, those issues may best be handled with a new sort of data structure that goes beyond the knowledge base and incorporates aspects of perceptual knowledge and even more, in which a kind of anticipatory action may be key.",1
"Attribute exploration has been investigated in several studies, with particular emphasis on the algorithmic aspects of this knowledge acquisition method. In its basic version the method itself is rather simple and transparent. But when background knowledge and partially described counter-examples are admitted, it gets more difficult. Here we discuss this case in an abstract, somewhat ""axiomatic"" setting, providing a terminology that clarifies the abstract strategy of the method rather than its algorithmic implementation.",0
"Microsoft Kinect camera and its skeletal tracking capabilities have been embraced by many researchers and commercial developers in various applications of real-time human movement analysis. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of the human kinematic motion data in the first and second generation of the Kinect system, and compare the results with an optical motion capture system. We collected motion data in 12 exercises for 10 different subjects and from three different viewpoints. We report on the accuracy of the joint localization and bone length estimation of Kinect skeletons in comparison to the motion capture. We also analyze the distribution of the joint localization offsets by fitting a mixture of Gaussian and uniform distribution models to determine the outliers in the Kinect motion data. Our analysis shows that overall Kinect 2 has more robust and more accurate tracking of human pose as compared to Kinect 1.",0
"This paper considers the problem of representative selection: choosing a subset of data points from a dataset that best represents its overall set of elements. This subset needs to inherently reflect the type of information contained in the entire set, while minimizing redundancy. For such purposes, clustering may seem like a natural approach. However, existing clustering methods are not ideally suited for representative selection, especially when dealing with non-metric data, where only a pairwise similarity measure exists. In this paper we propose $\delta$-medoids, a novel approach that can be viewed as an extension to the $k$-medoids algorithm and is specifically suited for sample representative selection from non-metric data. We empirically validate $\delta$-medoids in two domains, namely music analysis and motion analysis. We also show some theoretical bounds on the performance of $\delta$-medoids and the hardness of representative selection in general.",0
"We address the problem of identifying dynamic sequential plans in the framework of causal Bayesian networks, and show that the problem is reduced to identifying causal effects, for which there are complete identi cation algorithms available in the literature.",0
"The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.",1
"This paper presents a design of a non-player character (AI) for promoting balancedness in use of body segments when engaging in full-body motion gaming. In our experiment, we settle a battle between the proposed AI and a player by using FightingICE, a fighting game platform for AI development. A middleware called UKI is used to allow the player to control the game by using body motion instead of the keyboard and mouse. During gameplay, the proposed AI analyze health states of the player; it determines its next action by predicting how each candidate action, recommended by a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, will induce the player to move, and how the player's health tends to be affected. Our result demonstrates successful improvement in balancedness in use of body segments on 4 out of 5 subjects.",0
"To date, developing a good model for early intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction is still challenging. This paper presents a patient based predictive modeling framework (PPMF) to improve the performance of ICU mortality prediction using data collected during the first 48 hours of ICU admission. PPMF consists of three main components verifying three related research hypotheses. The first component captures dynamic changes of patients status in the ICU using their time series data (e.g., vital signs and laboratory tests). The second component is a local approximation algorithm that classifies patients based on their similarities. The third component is a Gradient Decent wrapper that updates feature weights according to the classification feedback. Experiments using data from MIMICIII show that PPMF significantly outperforms: (1) the severity score systems, namely SASP III, APACHE IV, and MPM0III, (2) the aggregation based classifiers that utilize summarized time series, and (3) baseline feature selection methods.",0
"As digital games continue to be explored as solutions to educational and behavioural challenges, the need for evaluation methodologies which support both the unique nature of the format and the need for comparison with other approaches continues to increase. In this workshop paper, a range of challenges are described related specifically to the case of cultural learning using digital games, in terms of how it may best be assessed, understood, and sustained through an iterative process supported by research. An evaluation framework is proposed, identifying metrics for reach and impact and their associated challenges, as well as presenting ethical considerations and the means to utilize evaluation outcomes within an iterative cycle, and to provide feedback to learners. Presenting as a case study a serious game from the Mobile Assistance for Social Inclusion and Empowerment of Immigrants with Persuasive Learning Technologies and Social Networks (MASELTOV) project, the use of the framework in the context of an integrative project is discussed, with emphasis on the need to view game-based learning as a blended component of the cultural learning process, rather than a standalone solution. The particular case of mobile gaming is also considered within this case study, providing a platform by which to deliver and update content in response to evaluation outcomes. Discussion reflects upon the general challenges related to the assessment of cultural learning, and behavioural change in more general terms, suggesting future work should address the need to provide sustainable, research-driven platforms for game-based learning content.",0
"The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) is an important combinatorial problem with applications in many areas. It is among the first problems used for studying intrinsic properties, including phase transitions, of combinatorial problems. While thorough theoretical and experimental analyses have been made on the HCP in undirected graphs, a limited amount of work has been done for the HCP in directed graphs (DHCP). The main contribution of this work is an effective algorithm for the DHCP. Our algorithm explores and exploits the close relationship between the DHCP and the Assignment Problem (AP) and utilizes a technique based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT). By combining effective algorithms for the AP and SAT, our algorithm significantly outperforms previous exact DHCP algorithms, including an algorithm based on the award-winning Concorde TSP algorithm. The second result of the current study is an experimental analysis of phase transitions of the DHCP, verifying and refining a known phase transition of the DHCP.",0
"Path queries on a knowledge graph can be used to answer compositional questions such as ""What languages are spoken by people living in Lisbon?"". However, knowledge graphs often have missing facts (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute missing facts by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors. This motivates a new ""compositional"" training objective, which dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing errors by up to 43%) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.",1
"In reinforcement learning, the standard criterion to evaluate policies in a state is the expectation of (discounted) sum of rewards. However, this criterion may not always be suitable, we consider an alternative criterion based on the notion of quantiles. In the case of episodic reinforcement learning problems, we propose an algorithm based on stochastic approximation with two timescales. We evaluate our proposition on a simple model of the TV show, Who wants to be a millionaire.",0
"Evaluation of counterfactual queries (e.g., ""If A were true, would C have been true?"") is important to fault diagnosis, planning, and determination of liability. In this paper we present methods for computing the probabilities of such queries using the formulation proposed in [Balke and Pearl, 1994], where the antecedent of the query is interpreted as an external action that forces the proposition A to be true. When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms governing the domain, counterfactual probabilities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as conditional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determination of liability in product-safety litigation.",0
"For a pure Horn Boolean function on $n$ variables, we show that unless P=NP, it is not possible to approximate in polynomial time (in $n$) the minimum numbers of clauses and literals to within factors of $2^{O(\log^{1-o(1)} n)}$ even when the inputs are restricted to 3-CNFs with $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ clauses, for some small $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Furthermore, we show that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false, it is not possible to obtain constant factor approximations for these problems even having sub-exponential time (in $n$) available.",0
"Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) which were introduced in 2008 has since drawn attention around the world for both its advantages as well as criticism on its drawbacks. One of the issues in MOOCs which is the lack of interactivity with the instructor has brought conversational bot into the picture to fill in this gap. In this study, a prototype of MOOCs conversational bot, MOOC-bot is being developed and integrated into MOOCs website to respond to the learner inquiries using text or speech input. MOOC-bot is using the popular Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base, leverage from AIML capability to deliver appropriate responses and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains. The system architecture of MOOC-bot consists of knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface, MOOCs website and Web Speech API to provide speech recognition and speech synthesis capability. The initial MOOC-bot prototype has the general knowledge from the past Loebner Prize winner - ALICE, frequent asked questions, and a content offered by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). The evaluation of MOOC-bot based on the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize has shown that it was able to provide correct answers most of the time during the test and demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation. The advantages of MOOC-bot such as able to provide 24-hour service that can serve different time zones, able to have knowledge in multiple domains, and can be shared by multiple sites simultaneously have outweighed its existing limitations.",0
"The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on a relational structure B is to decide, given a set of constraints on variables where the relations come from B, whether or not there is a assignment to the variables satisfying all of the constraints; the surjective CSP is the variant where one decides the existence of a surjective satisfying assignment onto the universe of B. We present an algebraic condition on the polymorphism clone of B and prove that it is sufficient for the hardness of the surjective CSP on a finite structure B, in the sense that this problem admits a reduction from a certain fixed-structure CSP. To our knowledge, this is the first result that allows one to use algebraic information from a relational structure B to infer information on the complexity hardness of surjective constraint satisfaction on B. A corollary of our result is that, on any finite non-trivial structure having only essentially unary polymorphisms, surjective constraint satisfaction is NP-complete.",0
"This paper presents a sound and completecalculus for causal relevance, based onPearl's functional models semantics.The calculus consists of axioms and rulesof inference for reasoning about causalrelevance relationships.We extend the set of known axioms for causalrelevance with three new axioms, andintroduce two new rules of inference forreasoning about specific subclasses ofmodels.These subclasses give a more refinedcharacterization of causal models than the one given in Halpern's axiomatizationof counterfactual reasoning.Finally, we show how the calculus for causalrelevance can be used in the task ofidentifying causal structure from non-observational data.",0
"Many real-world problems involving constraints can be regarded as instances of the Max-SAT problem, which is the optimization variant of the classic satisfiability problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic approach for Max-SAT called ProMS. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic local search strategy using a novel probability distribution function with two strategies for picking variables, one based on available information and another purely random one. Moreover, while most previous algorithms based on WalkSAT choose unsatisfied clauses randomly, we introduce a novel clause selection strategy to improve our algorithm. Experimental results illustrate that ProMS outperforms many state-of-the-art stochastic local search solvers on hard unweighted random Max-SAT benchmarks.",0
A completeness result for d-separation applied to discrete Bayesian networks is presented and it is shown that in a strong measure-theoretic sense almost all discrete distributions for a given network structure are faithful; i.e. the independence facts true of the distribution are all and only those entailed by the network structure.,0
"Formalisms for specifying statistical models, such as probabilistic-programming languages, typically consist of two components: a specification of a stochastic process (the prior), and a specification of observations that restrict the probability space to a conditional subspace (the posterior). Use cases of such formalisms include the development of algorithms in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We propose and investigate a declarative framework for specifying statistical models on top of a database, through an appropriate extension of Datalog. By virtue of extending Datalog, our framework offers a natural integration with the database, and has a robust declarative semantics. Our Datalog extension provides convenient mechanisms to include numerical probability functions; in particular, conclusions of rules may contain values drawn from such functions. The semantics of a program is a probability distribution over the possible outcomes of the input database with respect to the program; these outcomes are minimal solutions with respect to a related program with existentially quantified variables in conclusions. Observations are naturally incorporated by means of integrity constraints over the extensional and intensional relations. We focus on programs that use discrete numerical distributions, but even then the space of possible outcomes may be uncountable (as a solution can be infinite). We define a probability measure over possible outcomes by applying the known concept of cylinder sets to a probabilistic chase procedure. We show that the resulting semantics is robust under different chases. We also identify conditions guaranteeing that all possible outcomes are finite (and then the probability space is discrete). We argue that the framework we propose retains the purely declarative nature of Datalog, and allows for natural specifications of statistical models.",0
"The AGM model is the most remarkable framework for modeling belief revision. However, it is not perfect in all aspects. Paraconsistent belief revision, multi-agent belief revision and non-prioritized belief revision are three different extensions to AGM to address three important criticisms applied to it. In this article, we propose a framework based on AGM that takes a position in each of these categories. Also, we discuss some features of our framework and study the satisfiability of AGM postulates in this new context.",0
"This article proposes the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures for implementing Hierarchical Graph Neuron, an architecture for memorizing patterns of generic sensor stimuli. The adoption of a Vector Symbolic representation ensures a one-layered design for the approach, while maintaining the previously reported properties and performance characteristics of Hierarchical Graph Neuron, and also improving the noise resistance of the architecture. The proposed architecture enables a linear (with respect to the number of stored entries) time search for an arbitrary sub-pattern.",0
"Penetration Testing is a methodology for assessing network security, by generating and executing possible attacks. Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question then is how to automatically generate the attacks. A natural way to address this issue is as an attack planning problem. In this thesis, we are concerned with the specific context of regular automated pentesting, and use the term ""attack planning"" in that sense. The following three research directions are investigated.",0
"The survey propagation (SP) algorithm has been shown to work well on large instances of the random 3-SAT problem near its phase transition. It was shown that SP estimates marginals over covers that represent clusters of solutions. The SP-y algorithm generalizes SP to work on the maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) problem, but the cover interpretation of SP does not generalize to SP-y. In this paper, we formulate the relaxed survey propagation (RSP) algorithm, which extends the SP algorithm to apply to the weighted Max-SAT problem. We show that RSP has an interpretation of estimating marginals over covers violating a set of clauses with minimal weight. This naturally generalizes the cover interpretation of SP. Empirically, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y and other state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on random Max-SAT instances. RSP also outperforms state-of-the-art weighted Max-SAT solvers on random weighted Max-SAT instances.",0
"Probabilistic independence can dramatically simplify the task of eliciting, representing, and computing with probabilities in large domains. A key technique in achieving these benefits is the idea of graphical modeling. We survey existing notions of independence for utility functions in a multi-attribute space, and suggest that these can be used to achieve similar advantages. Our new results concern conditional additive independence, which we show always has a perfect representation as separation in an undirected graph (a Markov network). Conditional additive independencies entail a particular functional for the utility function that is analogous to a product decomposition of a probability function, and confers analogous benefits. This functional form has been utilized in the Bayesian network and influence diagram literature, but generally without an explanation in terms of independence. The functional form yields a decomposition of the utility function that can greatly speed up expected utility calculations, particularly when the utility graph has a similar topology to the probabilistic network being used.",0
"Lately, there has been an increasing interest in hand gesture analysis systems. Recent works have employed pattern recognition techniques and have focused on the development of systems with more natural user interfaces. These systems may use gestures to control interfaces or recognize sign language gestures, which can provide systems with multimodal interaction; or consist in multimodal tools to help psycholinguists to understand new aspects of discourse analysis and to automate laborious tasks. Gestures are characterized by several aspects, mainly by movements and sequence of postures. Since data referring to movements or sequences carry temporal information, this paper presents a literature review about temporal aspects of hand gesture analysis, focusing on applications related to natural conversation and psycholinguistic analysis, using Systematic Literature Review methodology. In our results, we organized works according to type of analysis, methods, highlighting the use of Machine Learning techniques, and applications.",0
"We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.",0
"Dung's abstract argumentation theory can be seen as a general framework for non-monotonic reasoning. An important question is then: what is the class of logics that can be subsumed as instantiations of this theory? The goal of this paper is to identify and study the large class of logic-based instantiations of Dung's theory which correspond to the maxi-consistent operator, i.e. to the function which returns maximal consistent subsets of an inconsistent knowledge base. In other words, we study the class of instantiations where very extension of the argumentation system corresponds to exactly one maximal consistent subset of the knowledge base. We show that an attack relation belonging to this class must be conflict-dependent, must not be valid, must not be conflict-complete, must not be symmetric etc. Then, we show that some attack relations serve as lower or upper bounds of the class (e.g. if an attack relation contains canonical undercut then it is not a member of this class). By using our results, we show for all existing attack relations whether or not they belong to this class. We also define new attack relations which are members of this class. Finally, we interpret our results and discuss more general questions, like: what is the added value of argumentation in such a setting? We believe that this work is a first step towards achieving our long-term goal, which is to better understand the role of argumentation and, particularly, the expressivity of logic-based instantiations of Dung-style argumentation frameworks.",0
"Speech based solutions have taken center stage with growth in the services industry where there is a need to cater to a very large number of people from all strata of the society. While natural language speech interfaces are the talk in the research community, yet in practice, menu based speech solutions thrive. Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to respond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A sequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion of a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can correctly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by the system. The usual mechanism to evaluate the performance of a speech solution is to do an extensive test of the system by putting it to actual people use and then evaluating the performance by analyzing the logs for successful transactions. This kind of evaluation could lead to dissatisfied test users especially if the performance of the system were to result in a poor transaction completion rate. To negate this the Wizard of Oz approach is adopted during evaluation of a speech system. Overall this kind of evaluations is an expensive proposition both in terms of time and cost. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the performance of a speech solution without actually putting it to people use. We first describe the methodology and then show experimentally that this can be used to identify the performance bottlenecks of the speech solution even before the system is actually used thus saving evaluation time and expenses.",0
"Consider the situation where some evidence e has been entered to a Bayesian network. When performing conflict analysis, sensitivity analysis, or when answering questions like ""What if the finding on X had been y instead of x?"" you need probabilities P (e'| h), where e' is a subset of e, and h is a configuration of a (possibly empty) set of variables. Cautious propagation is a modification of HUGIN propagation into a Shafer-Shenoy-like architecture. It is less efficient than HUGIN propagation; however, it provides easy access to P (e'| h) for a great deal of relevant subsets e'.",0
"Chinese poetry generation is a very challenging task in natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage poetry generating method which first plans the sub-topics of the poem according to the user's writing intent, and then generates each line of the poem sequentially, using a modified recurrent neural network encoder-decoder framework. The proposed planning-based method can ensure that the generated poem is coherent and semantically consistent with the user's intent. A comprehensive evaluation with human judgments demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poetry generating methods and the poem quality is somehow comparable to human poets.",0
"In this paper, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based technique for Multi-label classification problems is proposed and discussed. In multi-label classification, each of the input data samples belongs to one or more than one class labels. The traditional binary and multi-class classification problems are the subset of the multi-label problem with the number of labels corresponding to each sample limited to one. The proposed ELM based multi-label classification technique is evaluated with six different benchmark multi-label datasets from different domains such as multimedia, text and biology. A detailed comparison of the results is made by comparing the proposed method with the results from nine state of the arts techniques for five different evaluation metrics. The nine methods are chosen from different categories of multi-label methods. The comparative results shows that the proposed Extreme Learning Machine based multi-label classification technique is a better alternative than the existing state of the art methods for multi-label problems.",0
"In previous work, we pointed out the limitations of standard Bayesian networks as a modeling framework for large, complex domains. We proposed a new, richly structured modeling language, {em Object-oriented Bayesian Netorks}, that we argued would be able to deal with such domains. However, it turns out that OOBNs are not expressive enough to model many interesting aspects of complex domains: the existence of specific named objects, arbitrary relations between objects, and uncertainty over domain structure. These aspects are crucial in real-world domains such as battlefield awareness. In this paper, we present SPOOK, an implemented system that addresses these limitations. SPOOK implements a more expressive language that allows it to represent the battlespace domain naturally and compactly. We present a new inference algorithm that utilizes the model structure in a fundamental way, and show empirically that it achieves orders of magnitude speedup over existing approaches.",0
"Recent years are seeing an increasing need for on-line monitoring of teams of cooperating agents, e.g., for visualization, or performance tracking. However, in monitoring deployed teams, we often cannot rely on the agents to always communicate their state to the monitoring system. This paper presents a non-intrusive approach to monitoring by 'overhearing', where the monitored team's state is inferred (via plan-recognition) from team-members' routine communications, exchanged as part of their coordinated task execution, and observed (overheard) by the monitoring system. Key challenges in this approach include the demanding run-time requirements of monitoring, the scarceness of observations (increasing monitoring uncertainty), and the need to scale-up monitoring to address potentially large teams. To address these, we present a set of complementary novel techniques, exploiting knowledge of the social structures and procedures in the monitored team: (i) an efficient probabilistic plan-recognition algorithm, well-suited for processing communications as observations; (ii) an approach to exploiting knowledge of the team's social behavior to predict future observations during execution (reducing monitoring uncertainty); and (iii) monitoring algorithms that trade expressivity for scalability, representing only certain useful monitoring hypotheses, but allowing for any number of agents and their different activities to be represented in a single coherent entity. We present an empirical evaluation of these techniques, in combination and apart, in monitoring a deployed team of agents, running on machines physically distributed across the country, and engaged in complex, dynamic task execution. We also compare the performance of these techniques to human expert and novice monitors, and show that the techniques presented are capable of monitoring at human-expert levels, despite the difficulty of the task.",0
"Measuring research impact and ranking academic achievement are important and challenging problems. Having an objective picture of research institution is particularly valuable for students, parents and funding agencies, and also attracts attention from government and industry. KDD Cup 2016 proposes the paper acceptance rank prediction task, in which the participants are asked to rank the importance of institutions based on predicting how many of their papers will be accepted at the 8 top conferences in computer science. In our work, we adopt a three-step feature engineering method, including basic features definition, finding similar conferences to enhance the feature set, and dimension reduction using PCA. We propose three ranking models and the ensemble methods for combining such models. Our experiment verifies the effectiveness of our approach. In KDD Cup 2016, we achieved the overall rank of the 2nd place.",0
"Although a number of related algorithms have been developed to evaluate influence diagrams, exploiting the conditional independence in the diagram, the exact solution has remained intractable for many important problems. In this paper we introduce decision circuits as a means to exploit the local structure usually found in decision problems and to improve the performance of influence diagram analysis. This work builds on the probabilistic inference algorithms using arithmetic circuits to represent Bayesian belief networks [Darwiche, 2003]. Once compiled, these arithmetic circuits efficiently evaluate probabilistic queries on the belief network, and methods have been developed to exploit both the global and local structure of the network. We show that decision circuits can be constructed in a similar fashion and promise similar benefits.",0
"Prime implicates and prime implicants have proven relevant to a number of areas of artificial intelligence, most notably abductive reasoning and knowledge compilation. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these notions might be appropriately extended from propositional logic to the modal logic K. We begin the paper by considering a number of potential definitions of clauses and terms for K. The different definitions are evaluated with respect to a set of syntactic, semantic, and complexity-theoretic properties characteristic of the propositional definition. We then compare the definitions with respect to the properties of the notions of prime implicates and prime implicants that they induce. While there is no definition that perfectly generalizes the propositional notions, we show that there does exist one definition which satisfies many of the desirable properties of the propositional case. In the second half of the paper, we consider the computational properties of the selected definition. To this end, we provide sound and complete algorithms for generating and recognizing prime implicates, and we show the prime implicate recognition task to be PSPACE-complete. We also prove upper and lower bounds on the size and number of prime implicates. While the paper focuses on the logic K, all of our results hold equally well for multi-modal K and for concept expressions in the description logic ALC.",0

"Imprecise-information processing will play an indispensable role in intelligent systems, especially in the anthropomorphic intelligent systems (as intelligent robots). A new theoretical and technological system of imprecise-information processing has been founded in Principles of Imprecise-Information Processing: A New Theoretical and Technological System[1] which is different from fuzzy technology. The system has clear hierarchy and rigorous structure, which results from the formation principle of imprecise information and has solid mathematical and logical bases, and which has many advantages beyond fuzzy technology. The system provides a technological platform for relevant applications and lays a theoretical foundation for further research.",0
"The knowledge base paradigm aims to express domain knowledge in a rich formal language, and to use this domain knowledge as a knowledge base to solve various problems and tasks that arise in the domain by applying multiple forms of inference. As such, the paradigm applies a strict separation of concerns between information and problem solving. In this paper, we analyze the principles and feasibility of the knowledge base paradigm in the context of an important class of applications: interactive configuration problems. In interactive configuration problems, a configuration of interrelated objects under constraints is searched, where the system assists the user in reaching an intended configuration. It is widely recognized in industry that good software solutions for these problems are very difficult to develop. We investigate such problems from the perspective of the KB paradigm. We show that multiple functionalities in this domain can be achieved by applying different forms of logical inferences on a formal specification of the configuration domain. We report on a proof of concept of this approach in a real-life application with a banking company. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",0
"Poker is ideal for testing automated reasoning under uncertainty. It introduces uncertainty both by physical randomization and by incomplete information about opponents hands.Another source OF uncertainty IS the limited information available TO construct psychological models OF opponents, their tendencies TO bluff, play conservatively, reveal weakness, etc. AND the relation BETWEEN their hand strengths AND betting behaviour. ALL OF these uncertainties must be assessed accurately AND combined effectively FOR ANY reasonable LEVEL OF skill IN the game TO be achieved, since good decision making IS highly sensitive TO those tasks.We describe our Bayesian Poker Program(BPP), which uses a Bayesian network TO model the programs poker hand, the opponents hand AND the opponents playing behaviour conditioned upon the hand, and betting curves which govern play given a probability of winning. The history of play with opponents is used to improve BPPs understanding OF their behaviour.We compare BPP experimentally WITH : a simple RULE - based system; a program which depends exclusively ON hand probabilities(i.e., without opponent modeling); AND WITH human players.BPP has shown itself TO be an effective player against ALL these opponents, barring the better humans.We also sketch out SOME likely ways OF improving play.",0
"Holding commercial negotiations and selecting the best supplier in supply chain management systems are among weaknesses of producers in production process. Therefore, applying intelligent systems may have an effective role in increased speed and improved quality in the selections .This paper introduces a system which tries to trade using multi-agents systems and holding negotiations between any agents. In this system, an intelligent agent is considered for each segment of chains which it tries to send order and receive the response with attendance in negotiation medium and communication with other agents .This paper introduces how to communicate between agents, characteristics of multi-agent and standard registration medium of each agent in the environment.

"Avoiding collisions is one of the vital tasks for systems of autonomous mobile agents. We focus on the problem of finding continuous coordinated paths for multiple mobile disc agents in a 2-d environment with polygonal obstacles. The problem is PSPACE-hard, with the state space growing exponentially in the number of agents. Therefore, the state of the art methods include mainly reactive techniques and sampling-based iterative algorithms.",0
"Merging beliefs requires the plausibility of the sources of the information to be merged. They are typically assumed equally reliable in lack of hints indicating otherwise; yet, a recent line of research spun from the idea of deriving this information from the revision process itself. In particular, the history of previous revisions and previous merging examples provide information for performing subsequent mergings.",0
"Without Linked Data, transport data is limited to applications exclusively around transport. In this paper, we present a workflow for publishing and linking transport data on the Web. So we will be able to develop transport applications and to add other features which will be created from other datasets. This will be possible because transport data will be linked to these datasets. We apply this workflow to two datasets: NEPTUNE, a French standard describing a transport line, and Passim, a directory containing relevant information on transport services, in every French city.",0
"Standard belief change assumes an underlying logic containing full classical propositional logic. However, there are good reasons for considering belief change in less expressive logics as well. In this paper we build on recent investigations by Delgrande on contraction for Horn logic. We show that the standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the Horn case. This result stands in contrast to Delgrande's conjecture that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate form of contraction for Horn logic. We then define a more appropriate notion of basic contraction for the Horn case, influenced by the convexity property holding for full propositional logic and which we refer to as infra contraction. The main contribution of this work is a result which shows that the construction method for Horn contraction for belief sets based on our infra remainder sets corresponds exactly to Hansson's classical kernel contraction for belief sets, when restricted to Horn logic. This result is obtained via a detour through contraction for belief bases. We prove that kernel contraction for belief bases produces precisely the same results as the belief base version of infra contraction. The use of belief bases to obtain this result provides evidence for the conjecture that Horn belief change is best viewed as a hybrid version of belief set change and belief base change. One of the consequences of the link with base contraction is the provision of a representation result for Horn contraction for belief sets in which a version of the Core-retainment postulate features.",0
"Many Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics applications involves the generation of new texts based on some existing texts, such as summarization, text simplification and machine translation. However, there has been a serious problem haunting these applications for decades, that is, how to automatically and accurately assess quality of these applications. In this paper, we will present some preliminary results on one especially useful and challenging problem in NLP system evaluation: how to pinpoint content differences of two text passages (especially for large pas-sages such as articles and books). Our idea is intuitive and very different from existing approaches. We treat one text passage as a small knowledge base, and ask it a large number of questions to exhaustively identify all content points in it. By comparing the correctly answered questions from two text passages, we will be able to compare their content precisely. The experiment using 2007 DUC summarization corpus clearly shows promising results.",0
"This paper reviews related work and state-of-the-art publications for recognizing motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD). It presents research efforts that were undertaken to inform on how well traditional machine learning algorithms can handle this task. In particular, four PD related motor symptoms are highlighted (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait and dyskinesia) and their details summarized. Thus the primary objective of this research is to provide a literary foundation for development and improvement of algorithms for detecting PD related motor symptoms.",0
"In recent years, with the advent of the web of data, a growing number of national mapping agencies tend to publish their geospatial data as Linked Data. However, differences between traditional GIS data models and Linked Data model can make the publication process more complicated. Besides, it may require, to be done, the setting of several parameters and some expertise in the semantic web technologies. In addition, the use of standards like GeoSPARQL (or ad hoc predicates) is mandatory to perform spatial queries on published geospatial data. In this paper, we present GeomRDF, a tool that helps users to convert spatial data from traditional GIS formats to RDF model easily. It generates geometries represented as GeoSPARQL WKT literal but also as structured geometries that can be exploited by using only the RDF query language, SPARQL. GeomRDF was implemented as a module in the RDF publication platform Datalift. A validation of GeomRDF has been realized against the French administrative units dataset (provided by IGN France).",0
"We consider the problem of learning good trajectories for manipulation tasks. This is challenging because the criterion defining a good trajectory varies with users, tasks and environments. In this paper, we propose a co-active online learning framework for teaching robots the preferences of its users for object manipulation tasks. The key novelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user: the human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training data, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly improve over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that this co-active preference feedback can be more easily elicited from the user than demonstrations of optimal trajectories, while, nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds of our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms. We demonstrate the generalization ability of our algorithm on a variety of tasks, for whom, the preferences were not only influenced by the object being manipulated but also by the surrounding environment.",1
"This paper presents a new anytime algorithm for the marginal MAP problem in graphical models. The algorithm is described in detail, its complexity and convergence rate are studied, and relations to previous theoretical results for the problem are discussed. It is shown that the algorithm runs in polynomial-time if the underlying graph of the model has bounded tree-width, and that it provides guarantees to the lower and upper bounds obtained within a fixed amount of computational resources. Experiments with both real and synthetic generated models highlight its main characteristics and show that it compares favorably against Park and Darwiche's systematic search, particularly in the case of problems with many MAP variables and moderate tree-width.",1
"Many exact and approximate solution methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) attempt to exploit structure in the problem and are based on factorization of the value function. Especially multiagent settings, however, are known to suffer from an exponential increase in value component sizes as interactions become denser, meaning that approximation architectures are restricted in the problem sizes and types they can handle. We present an approach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems, exploiting a property that can be thought of as ""anonymous influence"" in the factored MDP. Anonymous influence summarizes joint variable effects efficiently whenever the explicit representation of variable identity in the problem can be avoided. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into computational efficiencies, both for general variable elimination in a factor graph but in particular also for the approximate linear programming solution to factored MDPs. The latter allows to scale linear programming to factored MDPs that were previously unsolvable. Our results are shown for the control of a stochastic disease process over a densely connected graph with 50 nodes and 25 agents.",1
"While the possibility of time travel in physics is still debated, the explosive growth of virtual-reality simulations opens up new possibilities to rigorously explore such time travel and its consequences in the digital domain. Here we provide a computational model of time travel and a computer program that allows exploring digital time travel. In order to explain our method we formalize a simplified version of the famous grandfather paradox, show how the system can allow the participant to go back in time, try to kill their ancestors before they were born, and experience the consequences. The system has even come up with scenarios that can be considered consistent ""solutions"" of the grandfather paradox. We discuss the conditions for digital time travel, which indicate that it has a large number of practical applications.",0
"The EM-algorithm is a general procedure to get maximum likelihood estimates if part of the observations on the variables of a network are missing. In this paper a stochastic version of the algorithm is adapted to probabilistic neural networks describing the associative dependency of variables. These networks have a probability distribution, which is a special case of the distribution generated by probabilistic inference networks. Hence both types of networks can be combined allowing to integrate probabilistic rules as well as unspecified associations in a sound way. The resulting network may have a number of interesting features including cycles of probabilistic rules, hidden 'unobservable' variables, and uncertain and contradictory evidence.",0
"We provide a systematic analysis of levels of integration between discrete high-level reasoning and continuous low-level reasoning to address hybrid planning problems in robotics. We identify four distinct strategies for such an integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the results of previous low- level checks. We perform experiments on hybrid planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies for a given domain.",0
"In this paper new hierarchical hybrid fuzzy-crisp methods for decision making and action selection of an agent in soccer simulation 3D environment are presented. First, the skills of an agent are introduced, implemented and classified in two layers, the basicskills and the highlevel skills. In the second layer, a twophase mechanism for decision making is introduced. In phase one, some useful methods are implemented which check the agent's situation for performing required skills. In the next phase, the team str ategy, team for mation, agent's role and the agent's positioning system are introduced. A fuzzy logical approach is employed to recognize the team strategy and further more to tell the player the best position to move. At last, we comprised our implemented algor ithm in the Robocup Soccer Simulation 3D environment and results showed th eefficiency of the introduced methodology.",0
"The Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm is a direct search technique mostly used in discrete domains. It repeats the process of randomly selecting a neighbour of a best-so-far solution and accepts the neighbour if it is better than or equal to it. In this work, we propose to use a novel method to select the neighbour solution using a set of independent multi- armed bandit-style selection units which results in a bandit-based Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm. The new algorithm significantly outperforms Random Mutation Hill-Climbing in both OneMax (in noise-free and noisy cases) and Royal Road problems (in the noise-free case). The algorithm shows particular promise for discrete optimisation problems where each fitness evaluation is expensive.",0
A large part of the use of knowledge base systems is the interpretation of the output by the end-users and the interaction with these users. Even during the development process visualisations can be a great help to the developer. We created IDPD3 as a library to visualise models of logic theories. IDPD3 is a new version of $ID^{P}_{Draw}$ and adds support for visualised interactive simulations.,0
We propose a novel online learning method for minimizing regret in large extensive-form games. The approach learns a function approximator online to estimate the regret for choosing a particular action. A no-regret algorithm uses these estimates in place of the true regrets to define a sequence of policies.,1
"Surely we want solid foundations. What kind of castle can we build on sand? What is the point of devoting effort to balconies and minarets, if the foundation may be so weak as to allow the structure to collapse of its own weight? We want our foundations set on bedrock, designed to last for generations. Who would want an architect who cannot certify the soundness of the foundations of his buildings?",0
"Many formalisms combining ontology languages with uncertainty, usually in the form of probabilities, have been studied over the years. Most of these formalisms, however, assume that the probabilistic structure of the knowledge remains static over time. We present a general approach for extending ontology languages to handle time-evolving uncertainty represented by a dynamic Bayesian network. We show how reasoning in the original language and dynamic Bayesian inferences can be exploited for effective reasoning in our framework.",0
"A fundamental task for propositional logic is to compute models of propositional formulas. Programs developed for this task are called satisfiability solvers. We show that transition systems introduced by Nieuwenhuis, Oliveras, and Tinelli to model and analyze satisfiability solvers can be adapted for solvers developed for two other propositional formalisms: logic programming under the answer-set semantics, and the logic PC(ID). We show that in each case the task of computing models can be seen as ""satisfiability modulo answer-set programming,"" where the goal is to find a model of a theory that also is an answer set of a certain program. The unifying perspective we develop shows, in particular, that solvers CLASP and MINISATID are closely related despite being developed for different formalisms, one for answer-set programming and the latter for the logic PC(ID).",0
"Symmetry is an important problem in many combinatorial problems. One way of dealing with symmetry is to add constraints that eliminate symmetric solutions. We survey recent results in this area, focusing especially on two common and useful cases: symmetry breaking constraints for row and column symmetry, and symmetry breaking constraints for eliminating value symmetry",1
"Scheduling problems in manufacturing, logistics and project management have frequently been modeled using the framework of Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problems with minimum and maximum time lags (RCPSP/max). Due to the importance of these problems, providing scalable solution schedules for RCPSP/max problems is a topic of extensive research. However, all existing methods for solving RCPSP/max assume that durations of activities are known with certainty, an assumption that does not hold in real world scheduling problems where unexpected external events such as manpower availability, weather changes, etc. lead to delays or advances in completion of activities. Thus, in this paper, our focus is on providing a scalable method for solving RCPSP/max problems with durational uncertainty. To that end, we introduce the robust local search method consisting of three key ideas: (a) Introducing and studying the properties of two decision rule approximations used to compute start times of activities with respect to dynamic realizations of the durational uncertainty; (b) Deriving the expression for robust makespan of an execution strategy based on decision rule approximations; and (c) A robust local search mechanism to efficiently compute activity execution strategies that are robust against durational uncertainty. Furthermore, we also provide enhancements to local search that exploit temporal dependencies between activities. Our experimental results illustrate that robust local search is able to provide robust execution strategies efficiently.",0
"Cybersecurity research involves publishing papers about malicious exploits as much as publishing information on how to design tools to protect cyber-infrastructure. It is this information exchange between ethical hackers and security experts, which results in a well-balanced cyber-ecosystem. In the blooming domain of AI Safety Engineering, hundreds of papers have been published on different proposals geared at the creation of a safe machine, yet nothing, to our knowledge, has been published on how to design a malevolent machine. Availability of such information would be of great value particularly to computer scientists, mathematicians, and others who have an interest in AI safety, and who are attempting to avoid the spontaneous emergence or the deliberate creation of a dangerous AI, which can negatively affect human activities and in the worst case cause the complete obliteration of the human species. This paper provides some general guidelines for the creation of a Malevolent Artificial Intelligence (MAI).",0
"In this paper, harmony search algorithm is applied to curriculum-based course timetabling. The implementation, specifically the process of improvisation consists of memory consideration, random consideration and pitch adjustment. In memory consideration, the value of the course number for new solution was selected from all other course number located in the same column of the Harmony Memory. This research used the highest occurrence of the course number to be scheduled in a new harmony. The remaining courses that have not been scheduled by memory consideration will go through random consideration, i.e. will select any feasible location available to be scheduled in the new harmony solution. Each course scheduled out of memory consideration is examined as to whether it should be pitch adjusted with probability of eight procedures. However, the algorithm produced results that were not comparatively better than those previously known as best solution. With proper modification in terms of the approach in this algorithm would make the algorithm perform better on curriculum-based course timetabling.",0
"Successful applications of reinforcement learning in real-world problems often require dealing with partially observable states. It is in general very challenging to construct and infer hidden states as they often depend on the agent's entire interaction history and may require substantial domain knowledge. In this work, we investigate a deep-learning approach to learning the representation of states in partially observable tasks, with minimal prior knowledge of the domain. In particular, we study reinforcement learning with deep neural networks, including RNN and LSTM, which are equipped with the desired property of being able to capture long-term dependency on history, and thus providing an effective way of learning the representation of hidden states. We further develop a hybrid approach that combines the strength of both supervised learning (for representing hidden states) and reinforcement learning (for optimizing control) with joint training. Extensive experiments based on a KDD Cup 1998 direct mailing campaign problem demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach, which performs the best across the board.",0
"Many real-world decision making tasks require us to choose among several expensive observations. In a sensor network, for example, it is important to select the subset of sensors that is expected to provide the strongest reduction in uncertainty. In medical decision making tasks, one needs to select which tests to administer before deciding on the most effective treatment. It has been general practice to use heuristic-guided procedures for selecting observations. In this paper, we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of probabilistic graphical models. For example, our algorithms allow to optimally label hidden variables in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations, and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan.",0
"We investigate the use of temporally abstract actions, or macro-actions, in the solution of Markov decision processes. Unlike current models that combine both primitive actions and macro-actions and leave the state space unchanged, we propose a hierarchical model (using an abstract MDP) that works with macro-actions only, and that significantly reduces the size of the state space. This is achieved by treating macroactions as local policies that act in certain regions of state space, and by restricting states in the abstract MDP to those at the boundaries of regions. The abstract MDP approximates the original and can be solved more efficiently. We discuss several ways in which macro-actions can be generated to ensure good solution quality. Finally, we consider ways in which macro-actions can be reused to solve multiple, related MDPs; and we show that this can justify the computational overhead of macro-action generation.",0
"We introduce a family of new equational semantics for argumentation networks which can handle odd and even loops in a uniform manner. We offer one version of equational semantics which is equivalent to CF2 semantics, and a better version which gives the same results as traditional Dung semantics for even loops but can still handle odd loops.",0
"Nowadays, several crowdsourcing projects exploit social choice methods for computing an aggregate ranking of alternatives given individual rankings provided by workers. Motivated by such systems, we consider a setting where each worker is asked to rank a fixed (small) number of alternatives and, then, a positional scoring rule is used to compute the aggregate ranking. Among the apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking. Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical viewpoint and present positive and negative complexity results and, furthermore, complement our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world and synthetic data.",1
"Speech Recognition searches to predict the spoken words automatically. These systems are known to be very expensive because of using several pre-recorded hours of speech. Hence, building a model that minimizes the cost of the recognizer will be very interesting. In this paper, we present a new approach for recognizing speech based on belief HMMs instead of proba-bilistic HMMs. Experiments shows that our belief recognizer is insensitive to the lack of the data and it can be trained using only one exemplary of each acoustic unit and it gives a good recognition rates. Consequently, using the belief HMM recognizer can greatly minimize the cost of these systems.",0
"The management of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the regulation of sedation and analgesia during ventilation, constitutes a major part of the care of patients admitted to intensive care units. Both prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation and premature extubation are associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs, but clinical opinion on the best protocol for weaning patients off of a ventilator varies. This work aims to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information to predict time-to-extubation readiness and to recommend a personalized regime of sedation dosage and ventilator support. To this end, we use off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the best action at a given patient state from sub-optimal historical ICU data. We compare treatment policies from fitted Q-iteration with extremely randomized trees and with feedforward neural networks, and demonstrate that the policies learnt show promise in recommending weaning protocols with improved outcomes, in terms of minimizing rates of reintubation and regulating physiological stability.",0
"Detecting and classifying targets in video streams from surveillance cameras is a cumbersome, error-prone and expensive task. Often, the incurred costs are prohibitive for real-time monitoring. This leads to data being stored locally or transmitted to a central storage site for post-incident examination. The required communication links and archiving of the video data are still expensive and this setup excludes preemptive actions to respond to imminent threats. An effective way to overcome these limitations is to build a smart camera that transmits alerts when relevant video sequences are detected. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to outperform humans in visual classifications tasks. The concept of DNNs and Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) can easily be extended to make use of higher-dimensional input data such as multispectral data. We explore this opportunity in terms of achievable accuracy and required computational effort. To analyze the precision of DNNs for scene labeling in an urban surveillance scenario we have created a dataset with 8 classes obtained in a field experiment. We combine an RGB camera with a 25-channel VIS-NIR snapshot sensor to assess the potential of multispectral image data for target classification. We evaluate several new DNNs, showing that the spectral information fused together with the RGB frames can be used to improve the accuracy of the system or to achieve similar accuracy with a 3x smaller computation effort. We achieve a very high per-pixel accuracy of 99.1%. Even for scarcely occurring, but particularly interesting classes, such as cars, 75% of the pixels are labeled correctly with errors occurring only around the border of the objects. This high accuracy was obtained with a training set of only 30 labeled images, paving the way for fast adaptation to various application scenarios.",0
"To overcome the #P-hardness of computing/updating prices in logarithm market scoring rule-based (LMSR-based) combinatorial prediction markets, Chen et al. [5] recently used a simple Bayesian network to represent the prices of securities in combinatorial predictionmarkets for tournaments, and showed that two types of popular securities are structure preserving. In this paper, we significantly extend this idea by employing Bayesian networks in general combinatorial prediction markets. We reveal a very natural connection between LMSR-based combinatorial prediction markets and probabilistic belief aggregation,which leads to a complete characterization of all structure preserving securities for decomposable network structures. Notably, the main results by Chen et al. [5] are corollaries of our characterization. We then prove that in order for a very basic set of securities to be structure preserving, the graph of the Bayesian network must be decomposable. We also discuss some approximation techniques for securities that are not structure preserving.",0
"Psychological research results have confirmed that people can have different emotional reactions to different visual stimuli. Several papers have been published on the problem of visual emotion analysis. In particular, attempts have been made to analyze and predict people's emotional reaction towards images. To this end, different kinds of hand-tuned features are proposed. The results reported on several carefully selected and labeled small image data sets have confirmed the promise of such features. While the recent successes of many computer vision related tasks are due to the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), visual emotion analysis has not achieved the same level of success. This may be primarily due to the unavailability of confidently labeled and relatively large image data sets for visual emotion analysis. In this work, we introduce a new data set, which started from 3+ million weakly labeled images of different emotions and ended up 30 times as large as the current largest publicly available visual emotion data set. We hope that this data set encourages further research on visual emotion analysis. We also perform extensive benchmarking analyses on this large data set using the state of the art methods including CNNs.",1
"Recently, there has been a growing interest in modeling planning with information constraints. Accordingly, an agent maximizes a regularized expected utility known as the free energy, where the regularizer is given by the information divergence from a prior to a posterior policy. While this approach can be justified in various ways, including from statistical mechanics and information theory, it is still unclear how it relates to decision-making against adversarial environments. This connection has previously been suggested in work relating the free energy to risk-sensitive control and to extensive form games. Here, we show that a single-agent free energy optimization is equivalent to a game between the agent and an imaginary adversary. The adversary can, by paying an exponential penalty, generate costs that diminish the decision maker's payoffs. It turns out that the optimal strategy of the adversary consists in choosing costs so as to render the decision maker indifferent among its choices, which is a definining property of a Nash equilibrium, thus tightening the connection between free energy optimization and game theory.",1
"Shared reference is an essential aspect of meaning. It is also indispensable for the semantic web, since it enables to weave the global graph, i.e., it allows different users to contribute to an identical referent. For example, an essential kind of referent is a geographic place, to which users may contribute observations. We argue for a human-centric, operational approach towards reference, based on respective human competences. These competences encompass perceptual, cognitive as well as technical ones, and together they allow humans to inter-subjectively refer to a phenomenon in their environment. The technology stack of the semantic web should be extended by such operations. This would allow establishing new kinds of observation-based reference systems that help constrain and integrate the semantic web bottom-up.",0
"In the recent literature of Artificial Intelligence, an intensive research effort has been spent, for various algebras of qualitative relations used in the representation of temporal and spatial knowledge, on the problem of classifying the computational complexity of reasoning problems for subsets of algebras. The main purpose of these researches is to describe a restricted set of maximal tractable subalgebras, ideally in an exhaustive fashion with respect to the hosting algebras. In this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about Spatial Congruence, show that the satisfiability problem in the spatial algebra MC-4 is NP-complete, and present a complete classification of tractability in the algebra, based on the individuation of three maximal tractable subclasses, one containing the basic relations. The three algebras are formed by 14, 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which form the full algebra.",0
"We show an alternative way of representing a Bayesian belief network by sensitivities and probability distributions. This representation is equivalent to the traditional representation by conditional probabilities, but makes dependencies between nodes apparent and intuitively easy to understand. We also propose a QR matrix representation for the sensitivities and/or conditional probabilities which is more efficient, in both memory requirements and computational speed, than the traditional representation for computer-based implementations of probabilistic inference. We use sensitivities to show that for a certain class of binary networks, the computation time for approximate probabilistic inference with any positive upper bound on the error of the result is independent of the size of the network. Finally, as an alternative to traditional algorithms that use conditional probabilities, we describe an exact algorithm for probabilistic inference that uses the QR-representation for sensitivities and updates probability distributions of nodes in a network according to messages from the neighbors.",0
"This paper describes a Bayesian method for combining an arbitrary mixture of observational and experimental data in order to learn causal Bayesian networks. Observational data are passively observed. Experimental data, such as that produced by randomized controlled trials, result from the experimenter manipulating one or more variables (typically randomly) and observing the states of other variables. The paper presents a Bayesian method for learning the causal structure and parameters of the underlying causal process that is generating the data, given that (1) the data contains a mixture of observational and experimental case records, and (2) the causal process is modeled as a causal Bayesian network. This learning method was applied using as input various mixtures of experimental and observational data that were generated from the ALARM causal Bayesian network. In these experiments, the absolute and relative quantities of experimental and observational data were varied systematically. For each of these training datasets, the learning method was applied to predict the causal structure and to estimate the causal parameters that exist among randomly selected pairs of nodes in ALARM that are not confounded. The paper reports how these structure predictions and parameter estimates compare with the true causal structures and parameters as given by the ALARM network.",0
"As network traffic monitoring software for cybersecurity, malware detection, and other critical tasks becomes increasingly automated, the rate of alerts and supporting data gathered, as well as the complexity of the underlying model, regularly exceed human processing capabilities. Many of these applications require complex models and constituent rules in order to come up with decisions that influence the operation of entire systems. In this paper, we motivate the novel ""strategic planning"" problem -- one of gathering data from the world and applying the underlying model of the domain in order to come up with decisions that will monitor the system in an automated manner. We describe our use of automated planning methods to this problem, including the technique that we used to solve it in a manner that would scale to the demands of a real-time, real world scenario. We then present a PDDL model of one such application scenario related to network administration and monitoring, followed by a description of a novel integrated system that was built to accept generated plans and to continue the execution process. Finally, we present evaluations of two different automated planners and their different capabilities with our integrated system, both on a six-month window of network data, and using a simulator.",0
"Studies on computational neuroscience through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and following biological inspired system stated that human action recognition in the brain of mammalian leads two distinct pathways in the model, which are specialized for analysis of motion (optic flow) and form information. Principally, we have defined a novel and robust form features applying active basis model as form extractor in form pathway in the biological inspired model. An unbalanced synergetic neural net-work classifies shapes and structures of human objects along with tuning its attention parameter by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) via initiation of Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations. These tools utilized and justified as strong tools for following biological system model in form pathway. But the final decision has done by combination of ultimate outcomes of both pathways via fuzzy inference which increases novality of proposed model. Combination of these two brain pathways is done by considering each feature sets in Gaussian membership functions with fuzzy product inference method. Two configurations have been proposed for form pathway: applying multi-prototype human action templates using two time synergetic neural network for obtaining uniform template regarding each actions, and second scenario that it uses abstracting human action in four key-frames. Experimental results showed promising accuracy performance on different datasets (KTH and Weizmann).",0
"We consider the problem of maximizing a non-monotone DR-submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. Diminishing returns (DR) submodularity is a generalization of the diminishing returns property for functions defined over the integer lattice. This generalization can be used to solve many machine learning or combinatorial optimization problems such as optimal budget allocation, revenue maximization, etc. In this work we propose the first polynomial-time approximation algorithms for non-monotone constrained maximization. We implement our algorithms for a revenue maximization problem with a real-world dataset to check their efficiency and performance.",0
"Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a significant technology in shaping the future by connecting physical devices or things with internet. It also presents various opportunities for intersection of other technological trends which can allow it to become even more intelligent and efficient. In this paper we focus our attention on the integration of Intelligent Conversational Software Agents or Chatbots with IoT. Literature surveys have looked into various applications, features, underlying technologies and known challenges of IoT. On the other hand, Chatbots are being adopted in greater numbers due to major strides in development of platforms and frameworks. The novelty of this paper lies in the specific integration of Chatbots in the IoT scenario. We analyzed the shortcomings of existing IoT systems and put forward ways to tackle them by incorporating chatbots. A general architecture is proposed for implementing such a system, as well as platforms and frameworks, both commercial and open source, which allow for implementation of such systems. Identification of the newer challenges and possible future directions with this new integration, have also been addressed.",0
"Several algorithms have been proposed for discovering patterns from trajectories of moving objects, but only a few have concentrated on outlier detection. Existing approaches, in general, discover spatial outliers, and do not provide any further analysis of the patterns. In this paper we introduce semantic spatial and spatio-temporal outliers and propose a new algorithm for trajectory outlier detection. Semantic outliers are computed between regions of interest, where objects have similar movement intention, and there exist standard paths which connect the regions. We show with experiments on real data that the method finds semantic outliers from trajectory data that are not discovered by similar approaches.",0
"In Chile, does not exist an independent entity that publishes quantitative or qualitative surveys to understand the traditional media environment and its adaptation on the Social Web. Nowadays, Chilean newsreaders are increasingly using social web platforms as their primary source of information, among which Twitter plays a central role. Historical media and pure players are developing different strategies to increase their audience and influence on this platform. In this article, we propose a methodology based on data mining techniques to provide a first level of analysis of the new Chilean media environment. We use a crawling technique to mine news streams of 37 different Chilean media actively presents on Twitter and propose several indicators to compare them. We analyze their volumes of production, their potential audience, and using NLP techniques, we explore the content of their production: their editorial line and their geographic coverage.",0
"Knowing whether a proposition is true means knowing that it is true or knowing that it is false. In this paper, we study logics with a modal operator Kw for knowing whether but without a modal operator K for knowing that. This logic is not a normal modal logic, because we do not have that Kw phi -&gt; Kw psi and Kw phi implies Kw psi. Knowing whether logic cannot define many common frame properties, and its expressive power less than that of basic modal logic over classes of models without reflexivity. These features make axiomatizing knowing whether logics non-trivial. We axiomatize knowing whether logic over various frame classes. We also present an extension of knowing whether logic with public announcement operators and we give corresponding reduction axioms for that. We compare our work in detail to two recent similar proposals.",0
"Causality has been recently introduced in databases, to model, characterize and possibly compute causes for query results (answers). Connections between query causality and consistency-based diagnosis and database repairs (wrt. integrity constrain violations) have been established in the literature. In this work we establish connections between query causality and abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem. The unveiled relationships allow us to obtain new complexity results for query causality -the main focus of our work- and also for the two other areas.",0
"Numerous machine learning problems require an exploration basis - a mechanism to explore the action space. We define a novel geometric notion of exploration basis with low variance, called volumetric spanners, and give efficient algorithms to construct such a basis.",0
"In order to be effective teammates, robots need to be able to understand high-level human behavior to recognize, anticipate, and adapt to human motion. We have designed a new approach to enable robots to perceive human group motion in real-time, anticipate future actions, and synthesize their own motion accordingly. We explore this within the context of joint action, where humans and robots move together synchronously. In this paper, we present an anticipation method which takes high-level group behavior into account. We validate the method within a human-robot interaction scenario, where an autonomous mobile robot observes a team of human dancers, and then successfully and contingently coordinates its movements to ""join the dance"". We compared the results of our anticipation method to move the robot with another method which did not rely on high-level group behavior, and found our method performed better both in terms of more closely synchronizing the robot's motion to the team, and also exhibiting more contingent and fluent motion. These findings suggest that the robot performs better when it has an understanding of high-level group behavior than when it does not. This work will help enable others in the robotics community to build more fluent and adaptable robots in the future.",0
"We present an algorithm for building rule lists that is two orders of magnitude faster than previous work. Rule list algorithms are competitors for decision tree algorithms. They are associative classifiers, in that they are built from pre-mined association rules. They have a logical structure that is a sequence of IF-THEN rules, identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Instead of using greedy splitting and pruning like decision tree algorithms, we fully optimize over rule lists, striking a practical balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational speed. The algorithm presented here uses a mixture of theoretical bounds (tight enough to have practical implications as a screening or bounding procedure), computational reuse, and highly tuned language libraries to achieve computational efficiency. Currently, for many practical problems, this method achieves better accuracy and sparsity than decision trees; further, in many cases, the computational time is practical and often less than that of decision trees.",1
"Machine comprehension of text is an important problem in natural language processing. A recently released dataset, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), offers a large number of real questions and their answers created by humans through crowdsourcing. SQuAD provides a challenging testbed for evaluating machine comprehension algorithms, partly because compared with previous datasets, in SQuAD the answers do not come from a small set of candidate answers and they have variable lengths. We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al.(2015) to constrain the output tokens to be from the input sequences. We propose two ways of using Pointer Net for our task. Our experiments show that both of our two models substantially outperform the best results obtained by Rajpurkar et al.(2016) using logistic regression and manually crafted features.",1
"Large unweighted directed graphs are commonly used to capture relations between entities. A fundamental problem in the analysis of such networks is to properly define the similarity or dissimilarity between any two vertices. Despite the significance of this problem, statistical characterization of the proposed metrics has been limited. We introduce and develop a class of techniques for analyzing random walks on graphs using stochastic calculus. Using these techniques we generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the graph. We show that the LTHT is consistent with respect to the underlying metric of a geometric graph, preserves clustering tendency, and remains robust against random addition of non-geometric edges. Tests on simulated and real-world data show that the LTHT matches theoretical predictions and outperforms alternatives.",1
"We introduce novel mathematical models and algorithms to generate (shortest or k different) explanations for biomedical queries, using answer set programming. We implement these algorithms and integrate them in BIOQUERY-ASP. We illustrate the usefulness of these methods with some complex biomedical queries related to drug discovery, over the biomedical knowledge resources PHARMGKB, DRUGBANK, BIOGRID, CTD, SIDER, DISEASE ONTOLOGY and ORPHADATA. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",1
"The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture important characteristics of many real-world domains, such as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited communication among agents and balances well between TP and the centralized MAPD algorithm.",0
"There is evidence that the numbers in probabilistic inference don't really matter. This paper considers the idea that we can make a probabilistic model simpler by making fewer distinctions. Unfortunately, the level of a Bayesian network seems too coarse; it is unlikely that a parent will make little difference for all values of the other parents. In this paper we consider an approximation scheme where distinctions can be ignored in some contexts, but not in other contexts. We elaborate on a notion of a parent context that allows a structured context-specific decomposition of a probability distribution and the associated probabilistic inference scheme called probabilistic partial evaluation (Poole 1997). This paper shows a way to simplify a probabilistic model by ignoring distinctions which have similar probabilities, a method to exploit the simpler model, a bound on the resulting errors, and some preliminary empirical results on simple networks.",0
"A method is presented for the rhythmic parsing problem: Given a sequence of observed musical note onset times, we estimate the corresponding notated rhythm and tempo process. A graphical model is developed that represents the simultaneous evolution of tempo and rhythm and relates these hidden quantities to observations. The rhythm variables are discrete and the tempo and observation variables are continuous. We show how to compute the globally most likely configuration of the tempo and rhythm variables given an observation of note onset times. Preliminary experiments are presented on a small data set. A generalization to arbitrary conditional Gaussian distributions is outlined.",0
"Handwriting is a skill learned by humans from a very early age. The ability to develop one's own unique handwriting as well as mimic another person's handwriting is a task learned by the brain with practice. This paper deals with this very problem where an intelligent system tries to learn the handwriting of an entity using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We propose a modified architecture of DCGAN (Radford, Metz, and Chintala 2015) to achieve this. We also discuss about applying reinforcement learning techniques to achieve faster learning. Our algorithm hopes to give new insights in this area and its uses include identification of forged documents, signature verification, computer generated art, digitization of documents among others. Our early implementation of the algorithm illustrates a good performance with MNIST datasets.",1
"On the Web, there is always a need to aggregate opinions from the crowd (as in posts, social networks, forums, etc.). Different mechanisms have been implemented to capture these opinions such as ""Like"" in Facebook, ""Favorite"" in Twitter, thumbs-up/down, flagging, and so on. However, in more contested domains (e.g. Wikipedia, political discussion, and climate change discussion) these mechanisms are not sufficient since they only deal with each issue independently without considering the relationships between different claims. We can view a set of conflicting arguments as a graph in which the nodes represent arguments and the arcs between these nodes represent the defeat relation. A group of people can then collectively evaluate such graphs. To do this, the group must use a rule to aggregate their individual opinions about the entire argument graph. Here, we present the first experimental evaluation of different aggregation rules presented in the literature. We use randomized controlled experiments to investigate which rules people consider better at aggregating opinions under different conditions. Our analysis reveals a number of factors, not captured by traditional formal models, that play an important role in determining the efficacy of aggregation. These results help bring formal models of argumentation closer to real-world application.",0
"We present a deep learning approach for speeding up constrained procedural modeling. Probabilistic inference algorithms such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) provide powerful tools for constraining procedural models, but they require many samples to produce desirable results. In this paper, we show how to create procedural models which learn how to satisfy constraints. We augment procedural models with neural networks: these networks control how the model makes random choices based on what output it has generated thus far. We call such a model a neurally-guided procedural model. As a pre-computation, we train these models on constraint-satisfying example outputs generated via SMC. They are then used as efficient importance samplers for SMC, generating high-quality results with very few samples. We evaluate our method on L-system-like models with image-based constraints. Given a desired quality threshold, neurally-guided models can generate satisfactory results up to 10x faster than unguided models.",1
This paper explores the role of independence of causal influence (ICI) in Bayesian network inference. ICI allows one to factorize a conditional probability table into smaller pieces. We describe a method for exploiting the factorization in clique tree propagation (CTP) - the state-of-the-art exact inference algorithm for Bayesian networks. We also present empirical results showing that the resulting algorithm is significantly more efficient than the combination of CTP and previous techniques for exploiting ICI.,0
"The Mediation Information System Engineering project is currently finishing its second iteration (MISE 2.0). The main objective of this scientific project is to provide any emerging collaborative situation with methods and tools to deploy a Mediation Information System (MIS). MISE 2.0 aims at defining and designing a service-based platform, dedicated to initiating and supporting the interoperability of collaborative situations among potential partners. This MISE 2.0 platform implements a model-driven engineering approach to the design of a service-oriented MIS dedicated to supporting the collaborative situation. This approach is structured in three layers, each providing their own key innovative points: (i) the gathering of individual and collaborative knowledge to provide appropriate collaborative business behaviour (key point: knowledge management, including semantics, exploitation and capitalization), (ii) deployment of a mediation information system able to computerize the previously deduced collaborative processes (key point: the automatic generation of collaborative workflows, including connection with existing devices or services) (iii) the management of the agility of the obtained collaborative network of organizations (key point: supervision of collaborative situations and relevant exploitation of the gathered data). MISE covers business issues (through BPM), technical issues (through an SOA) and agility issues of collaborative situations (through EDA).",0
The Rao-Blackwell theorem is utilized to analyze and improve the scalability of inference in large probabilistic models that exhibit symmetries. A novel marginal density estimator is introduced and shown both analytically and empirically to outperform standard estimators by several orders of magnitude. The developed theory and algorithms apply to a broad class of probabilistic models including statistical relational models considered not susceptible to lifted probabilistic inference.,1
"The clique tree algorithm is the standard method for doing inference in Bayesian networks. It works by manipulating clique potentials - distributions over the variables in a clique. While this approach works well for many networks, it is limited by the need to maintain an exact representation of the clique potentials. This paper presents a new unified approach that combines approximate inference and the clique tree algorithm, thereby circumventing this limitation. Many known approximate inference algorithms can be viewed as instances of this approach. The algorithm essentially does clique tree propagation, using approximate inference to estimate the densities in each clique. In many settings, the computation of the approximate clique potential can be done easily using statistical importance sampling. Iterations are used to gradually improve the quality of the estimation.",0
"We present a new combinatorial market maker that operates arbitrage-free combinatorial prediction markets specified by integer programs. Although the problem of arbitrage-free pricing, while maintaining a bound on the subsidy provided by the market maker, is #P-hard in the worst case, we posit that the typical case might be amenable to modern integer programming (IP) solvers. At the crux of our method is the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm which is used to implement a Bregman projection aligned with the market maker's cost function, using an IP solver as an oracle. We demonstrate the tractability and improved accuracy of our approach on real-world prediction market data from combinatorial bets placed on the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where the outcome space is of size $2^{63}$. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation and empirical evaluation of an arbitrage-free combinatorial prediction market on this scale.",0
"This article describes existing and expected benefits of the ""SP theory of intelligence"", and some potential applications. The theory aims to simplify and integrate ideas across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. It combines conceptual simplicity with descriptive and explanatory power across several areas of computing and cognition. In the ""SP machine"" -- an expression of the SP theory which is currently realised in the form of a computer model -- there is potential for an overall simplification of computing systems, including software. The SP theory promises deeper insights and better solutions in several areas of application, including natural language processing, autonomous robots, computer vision, intelligent databases, structuring of documents, software engineering, information compression, the economical transmission of data, big data, the semantic web, medical diagnosis, the detection of computer viruses, data fusion, and new kinds of computer. The theory promises seamless integration of structures and functions within and between different areas of application. The potential value, worldwide, of these benefits and applications is $190 billion each year. Further research would be facilitated by the creation of a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine, accessible via the web.",0
"Data quality is fundamentally important to ensure the reliability of data for stakeholders to make decisions. In real world applications, such as scientific exploration of extreme environments, it is unrealistic to require raw data collected to be perfect. As data miners, when it is infeasible to physically know the why and the how in order to clean up the data, we propose to seek the intrinsic structure of the signal to identify the common factors of multivariate data. Using our new data driven learning method, the common-factor data cleaning approach, we address an interdisciplinary challenge on multivariate data cleaning when complex external impacts appear to interfere with multiple data measurements. Existing data analyses typically process one signal measurement at a time without considering the associations among all signals. We analyze all signal measurements simultaneously to find the hidden common factors that drive all measurements to vary together, but not as a result of the true data measurements. We use common factors to reduce the variations in the data without changing the base mean level of the data to avoid altering the physical meaning.",0
"Parallel best-first search algorithms such as Hash Distributed A* (HDA*) distribute work among the processes using a global hash function. We analyze the search and communication overheads of state-of-the-art hash-based parallel best-first search algorithms, and show that although Zobrist hashing, the standard hash function used by HDA*, achieves good load balance for many domains, it incurs significant communication overhead since almost all generated nodes are transferred to a different processor than their parents. We propose Abstract Zobrist hashing, a new work distribution method for parallel search which, instead of computing a hash value based on the raw features of a state, uses a feature projection function to generate a set of abstract features which results in a higher locality, resulting in reduced communications overhead. We show that Abstract Zobrist hashing outperforms previous methods on search domains using hand-coded, domain specific feature projection functions. We then propose GRAZHDA*, a graph-partitioning based approach to automatically generating feature projection functions. GRAZHDA* seeks to approximate the partitioning of the actual search space graph by partitioning the domain transition graph, an abstraction of the state space graph. We show that GRAZHDA* outperforms previous methods on domain-independent planning.",0
"Game balancing is an important part of the (computer) game design process, in which designers adapt a game prototype so that the resulting gameplay is as entertaining as possible. In industry, the evaluation of a game is often based on costly playtests with human players. It suggests itself to automate this process using surrogate models for the prediction of gameplay and outcome. In this paper, the feasibility of automatic balancing using simulation- and deck-based objectives is investigated for the card game top trumps. Additionally, the necessity of a multi-objective approach is asserted by a comparison with the only known (single-objective) method. We apply a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to obtain decks that optimise objectives, e.g. win rate and average number of tricks, developed to express the fairness and the excitement of a game of top trumps. The results are compared with decks from published top trumps decks using simulation-based objectives. The possibility to generate decks better or at least as good as decks from published top trumps decks in terms of these objectives is demonstrated. Our results indicate that automatic balancing with the presented approach is feasible even for more complex games such as real-time strategy games.",0
"In principle, reinforcement learning and policy search methods can enable robots to learn highly complex and general skills that may allow them to function amid the complexity and diversity of the real world. However, training a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and asynchronous version of Guided Policy Search and use it to demonstrate collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four robots. We show that it achieves better generalization, utilization, and training times than the single robot alternative.",0
"We propose a new method of discovering causal structures, based on the detection of local, spontaneous changes in the underlying data-generating model. We analyze the classes of structures that are equivalent relative to a stream of distributions produced by local changes, and devise algorithms that output graphical representations of these equivalence classes. We present experimental results, using simulated data, and examine the errors associated with detection of changes and recovery of structures.",0
"To aide simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), future perception systems will incorporate forms of scene understanding. In a step towards fully integrated probabilistic geometric scene understanding, localization and mapping we propose the first direction-aware semi-dense SLAM system. It jointly infers the directional Stata Center World (SCW) segmentation and a surfel-based semi-dense map while performing real-time camera tracking. The joint SCW map model connects a scene-wide Bayesian nonparametric Dirichlet Process von-Mises-Fisher mixture model (DP-vMF) prior on surfel orientations with the local surfel locations via a conditional random field (CRF). Camera tracking leverages the SCW segmentation to improve efficiency via guided observation selection. Results demonstrate improved SLAM accuracy and tracking efficiency at state of the art performance.",0
"After data selection, pre-processing, transformation, and feature extraction, knowledge extraction is not the final step in a data mining process. It is then necessary to understand this knowledge in order to apply it efficiently and effectively. Up to now, there is a lack of appropriate techniques that support this significant step. This is partly due to the fact that the assessment of knowledge is often highly subjective, e.g., regarding aspects such as novelty or usefulness. These aspects depend on the specific knowledge and requirements of the data miner. There are, however, a number of aspects that are objective and for which it is possible to provide appropriate measures. In this article we focus on classification problems and use probabilistic generative classifiers based on mixture density models that are quite common in data mining applications. We define objective measures to assess the informativeness, uniqueness, importance, discrimination, representativity, uncertainty, and distinguishability of rules contained in these classifiers numerically. These measures not only support a data miner in evaluating results of a data mining process based on such classifiers. As we will see in illustrative case studies, they may also be used to improve the data mining process itself or to support the later application of the extracted knowledge.",0
"This work is concerned with regular languages defined over large alphabets, either infinite or just too large to be expressed enumeratively. We define a generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition of the alphabet. We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages from examples for such automata. We have implemented this algorithm and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural or real numbers. We sketch the extension of the algorithm to a class of languages over partially ordered alphabets.",0
"Characterizations of semi-stable and stage extensions in terms of 2-valued logical models are presented. To this end, the so-called GL-supported and GL-stage models are defined.

"Sensory inference under conditions of uncertainty is a major problem in both machine learning and computational neuroscience. An important but poorly understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing. Here, we present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing, C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller). Unlike previously proposed algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information maximization (Infomax) [Butko &amp; Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy [Najemnik &amp; Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and effort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly inadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity. These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.",0
"Previous studies in Open Information Extraction (Open IE) are mainly based on extraction patterns. They manually define patterns or automatically learn them from a large corpus. However, these approaches are limited when grasping the context of a sentence, and they fail to capture implicit relations. In this paper, we address this problem with the following methods. First, we exploit long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract higher-level features along the shortest dependency paths, connecting headwords of relations and arguments. The path-level features from LSTM networks provide useful clues regarding contextual information and the validity of arguments. Second, we constructed samples to train LSTM networks without the need for manual labeling. In particular, feedback negative sampling picks highly negative samples among non-positive samples through a model trained with positive samples. The experimental results show that our approach produces more precise and abundant extractions than state-of-the-art open IE systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply deep learning to Open IE.",0

"The size and complexity of software and hardware systems have significantly increased in the past years. As a result, it is harder to guarantee their correct behavior. One of the most successful methods for automated verification of finite-state systems is model checking. Most of the current model-checking systems use binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for the representation of the tested model and in the verification process of its properties. Generally, BDDs allow a canonical compact representation of a boolean function (given an order of its variables). The more compact the BDD is, the better performance one gets from the verifier. However, finding an optimal order for a BDD is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, several heuristic methods based on expert knowledge have been developed for variable ordering. We propose an alternative approach in which the variable ordering algorithm gains 'ordering experience' from training models and uses the learned knowledge for finding good orders. Our methodology is based on offline learning of pair precedence classifiers from training models, that is, learning which variable pair permutation is more likely to lead to a good order. For each training model, a number of training sequences are evaluated. Every training model variable pair permutation is then tagged based on its performance on the evaluated orders. The tagged permutations are then passed through a feature extractor and are given as examples to a classifier creation algorithm. Given a model for which an order is requested, the ordering algorithm consults each precedence classifier and constructs a pair precedence table which is used to create the order. Our algorithm was integrated with SMV, which is one of the most widely used verification systems. Preliminary empirical evaluation of our methodology, using real benchmark models, shows performance that is better than random ordering and is competitive with existing algorithms that use expert knowledge. We believe that in sub-domains of models (alu, caches, etc.) our system will prove even more valuable. This is because it features the ability to learn sub-domain knowledge, something that no other ordering algorithm does.",0
"We present an interpretable neural network approach to predicting and understanding politeness in natural language requests. Our models are based on simple convolutional neural networks directly on raw text, avoiding any manual identification of complex sentiment or syntactic features, while performing better than such feature-based models from previous work. More importantly, we use the challenging task of politeness prediction as a testbed to next present a much-needed understanding of what these successful networks are actually learning. For this, we present several network visualizations based on activation clusters, first derivative saliency, and embedding space transformations, helping us automatically identify several subtle linguistics markers of politeness theories. Further, this analysis reveals multiple novel, high-scoring politeness strategies which, when added back as new features, reduce the accuracy gap between the original featurized system and the neural model, thus providing a clear quantitative interpretation of the success of these neural networks.",1
"Many AI applications rely on knowledge about a relevant real-world domain that is encoded by means of some logical knowledge base (KB). The most essential benefit of logical KBs is the opportunity to perform automatic reasoning to derive implicit knowledge or to answer complex queries about the modeled domain. The feasibility of meaningful reasoning requires KBs to meet some minimal quality criteria such as logical consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the task of resolving violated quality criteria in KBs can be extremely tough even for domain experts, especially when the problematic KB includes a large number of logical formulas or comprises complicated logical formalisms.",0
"We tackle the fundamental problem of Bayesian active learning with noise, where we need to adaptively select from a number of expensive tests in order to identify an unknown hypothesis sampled from a known prior distribution. In the case of noise-free observations, a greedy algorithm called generalized binary search (GBS) is known to perform near-optimally. We show that if the observations are noisy, perhaps surprisingly, GBS can perform very poorly. We develop EC2, a novel, greedy active learning algorithm and prove that it is competitive with the optimal policy, thus obtaining the first competitiveness guarantees for Bayesian active learning with noisy observations. Our bounds rely on a recently discovered diminishing returns property called adaptive submodularity, generalizing the classical notion of submodular set functions to adaptive policies. Our results hold even if the tests have non-uniform cost and their noise is correlated. We also propose EffECXtive, a particularly fast approximation of EC2, and evaluate it on a Bayesian experimental design problem involving human subjects, intended to tease apart competing economic theories of how people make decisions under uncertainty.",1
"Agent programming is mostly a symbolic discipline and, as such, draws little benefits from probabilistic areas as machine learning and graphical models. However, the greatest objective of agent research is the achievement of autonomy in dynamical and complex environments --- a goal that implies embracing uncertainty and therefore the entailed representations, algorithms and techniques. This paper proposes an innovative and conflict free two layer approach to agent programming that uses already established methods and tools from both symbolic and probabilistic artificial intelligence. Moreover, this framework is illustrated by means of a widely used agent programming example, GoldMiners.",0
"Valuation based systems verifying an idempotent property are studied. A partial order is defined between the valuations giving them a lattice structure.

"Recent advances in metareasoning for search has shown its usefulness in improving numerous search algorithms. This paper applies rational metareasoning to IDA* when several admissible heuristics are available. The obvious basic approach of taking the maximum of the heuristics is improved upon by lazy evaluation of the heuristics, resulting in a variant known as Lazy IDA*. We introduce a rational version of lazy IDA* that decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics or to bypass it, based on a myopic expected regret estimate. Empirical evaluation in several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that rational lazy IDA* is a state-of-the-art heuristic combination method.",0

"In this paper, we propose an OCR (optical character recognition)-based localization system called OCRAPOSE II, which is applicable in a number of indoor scenarios including office buildings, parkings, airports, grocery stores, etc. In these scenarios, characters (i.e. texts or numbers) can be used as suitable distinctive landmarks for localization. The proposed system takes advantage of OCR to read these characters in the query still images and provides a rough location estimate using a floor plan. Then, it finds depth and angle-of-view of the query using the information provided by the OCR engine in order to refine the location estimate. We derive novel formulas for the query angle-of-view and depth estimation using image line segments and the OCR box information. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed system through experiments in indoor scenarios. It is shown that our system demonstrates better performance compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of location recognition rate and average localization error specially under sparse database condition.",0
"Many model-based Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms have been proposed in the past decade, often restricted to the type of camera optics, or the underlying motion manifold observed. We envision robots to be able to learn and perform these tasks, in a minimally supervised setting, as they gain more experience. To this end, we propose a fully trainable solution to visual ego-motion estimation for varied camera optics. We propose a visual ego-motion learning architecture that maps observed optical flow vectors to an ego-motion density estimate via a Mixture Density Network (MDN). By modeling the architecture as a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE), our model is able to provide introspective reasoning and prediction for ego-motion induced scene-flow. Additionally, our proposed model is especially amenable to bootstrapped ego-motion learning in robots where the supervision in ego-motion estimation for a particular camera sensor can be obtained from standard navigation-based sensor fusion strategies (GPS/INS and wheel-odometry fusion). Through experiments, we show the utility of our proposed approach in enabling the concept of self-supervised learning for visual ego-motion estimation in autonomous robots.",0
"Though the word cognitive has a wide range of meanings we define cognitive engineering as learning from brain to bolster engineering solutions. However, giving an achievable framework to the process towards this has been a difficult task. In this work we take the classic data information knowledge wisdom (DIKW) framework to set some achievable goals and sub-goals towards cognitive engineering. A layered framework like DIKW aligns nicely with the layered structure of pre-frontal cortex. And breaking the task into sub-tasks based on the layers also makes it easier to start developmental endeavours towards achieving the final goal of a brain-inspired system.",0
"SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is one of the most widespread ontologies in the life sciences, with more than 300,000 concepts and relationships, but is distributed with no associated software tools. In this paper we present MySNOM, a web-based SNOMED CT browser. MySNOM allows organizations to browse their own distribution of SNOMED CT under a controlled environment, focuses on navigating using the structure of SNOMED CT, and has diagramming capabilities.",0
"We study the connection between kappa calculus and probabilistic reasoning in diagnosis applications. Specifically, we abstract a probabilistic belief network for diagnosing faults into a kappa network and compare the ordering of faults computed using both methods. We show that, at least for the example examined, the ordering of faults coincide as long as all the causal relations in the original probabilistic network are taken into account. We also provide a formal analysis of some network structures where the two methods will differ. Both kappa rankings and infinitesimal probabilities have been used extensively to study default reasoning and belief revision. But little has been done on utilizing their connection as outlined above. This is partly because the relation between kappa and probability calculi assumes that probabilities are arbitrarily close to one (or zero). The experiments in this paper investigate this relation when this assumption is not satisfied. The reported results have important implications on the use of kappa rankings to enhance the knowledge engineering of uncertainty models.",0
"We adress the problem of dueling bandits defined on partially ordered sets, or posets. In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.",0
"Due to the intractable nature of exact lifted inference, research has recently focused on the discovery of accurate and efficient approximate inference algorithms in Statistical Relational Models (SRMs), such as Lifted First-Order Belief Propagation. FOBP simulates propositional factor graph belief propagation without constructing the ground factor graph by identifying and lifting over redundant message computations. In this work, we propose a generalization of FOBP called Lifted Generalized Belief Propagation, in which both the region structure and the message structure can be lifted. This approach allows more of the inference to be performed intra-region (in the exact inference step of BP), thereby allowing simulation of propagation on a graph structure with larger region scopes and fewer edges, while still maintaining tractability. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm converges in fewer iterations to more accurate results on a variety of SRMs.",0
"While wearable cameras are becoming increasingly popular, locating relevant information in large unstructured collections of egocentric images is still a tedious and time consuming processes. This paper addresses the problem of organizing egocentric photo streams acquired by a wearable camera into semantically meaningful segments. First, contextual and semantic information is extracted for each image by employing a Convolutional Neural Networks approach. Later, by integrating language processing, a vocabulary of concepts is defined in a semantic space. Finally, by exploiting the temporal coherence in photo streams, images which share contextual and semantic attributes are grouped together. The resulting temporal segmentation is particularly suited for further analysis, ranging from activity and event recognition to semantic indexing and summarization. Experiments over egocentric sets of nearly 17,000 images, show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",0
"We focus on the problem of finding a non-linear classification function that lies in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) both from the primal point of view (finding a perfect separator when one exists) and the dual point of view (giving a certificate of non-existence), with special focus on generalizations of two classical schemes - the Perceptron (primal) and Von-Neumann (dual) algorithms.",1
"This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and recognition. The problem deals with finding the most important region of interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an object class label. In other words, we are solving the three problems of saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one umbrella. The motivation behind such a problem formulation is 1) the benefits to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and 2) the potential improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three problems together. We propose a method as a baseline for further research. The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the associated objects, and labels them. The proposed problem and method are evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object class categories. We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion to compare the proposed algorithm with. Despite the good performance of the proposed baseline, the overall evaluations indicate that the problem of prominent object detection and recognition is a challenging task that is still worth investigating further.",0
Many papers have been published on the knowledge base completion task in the past few years. Most of these introduce novel architectures for relation learning that are evaluated on standard datasets such as FB15k and WN18. This paper shows that the accuracy of almost all models published on the FB15k can be outperformed by an appropriately tuned baseline - our reimplementation of the DistMult model. Our findings cast doubt on the claim that the performance improvements of recent models are due to architectural changes as opposed to hyper-parameter tuning or different training objectives. This should prompt future research to re-consider how the performance of models is evaluated and reported.,0
"This work lies in the fusion of experimental economics and data mining. It continues author's previous work on mining behaviour rules of human subjects from experimental data, where game-theoretic predictions partially fail to work. Game-theoretic predictions aka equilibria only tend to success with experienced subjects on specific games, what is rarely given. Apart from game theory, contemporary experimental economics offers a number of alternative models. In relevant literature, these models are always biased by psychological and near-psychological theories and are claimed to be proven by the data. This work introduces a data mining approach to the problem without using vast psychological background. Apart from determinism, no other biases are regarded. Two datasets from different human subject experiments are taken for evaluation. The first one is a repeated mixed strategy zero sum game and the second - repeated ultimatum game. As result, the way of mining deterministic regularities in human strategic behaviour is described and evaluated. As future work, the design of a new representation formalism is discussed.",0
"Object-oriented Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) support software reuse by providing pre-implemented functionalities. Due to the huge number of included classes, reusing and understanding large APIs is a complex task. Otherwise, software components are admitted to be more reusable and understandable entities than object-oriented ones. Thus, in this paper, we propose an approach for reengineering object-oriented APIs into component-based ones. We mine components as a group of classes based on the frequency they are used together and their ability to form a quality-centric component. To validate our approach, we experimented on 100 Java applications that used Android APIs.",0
"Gossip protocols aim at arriving, by means of point-to-point or group communications, at a situation in which all the agents know each other's secrets. We consider distributed gossip protocols which are expressed by means of epistemic logic. We provide an operational semantics of such protocols and set up an appropriate framework to argue about their correctness. Then we analyze specific protocols for complete graphs and for directed rings.",0
"This paper discusses the representation of ontologies in the first-order logical environment FOLE (Kent 2013). An ontology defines the primitives with which to model the knowledge resources for a community of discourse (Gruber 2009). These primitives, consisting of classes, relationships and properties, are represented by the entity-relationship-attribute ERA data model (Chen 1976). An ontology uses formal axioms to constrain the interpretation of these primitives. In short, an ontology specifies a logical theory. This paper is the first in a series of three papers that provide a rigorous mathematical representation for the ERA data model in particular, and ontologies in general, within the first-order logical environment FOLE. The first two papers show how FOLE represents the formalism and semantics of (many-sorted) first-order logic in a classification form corresponding to ideas discussed in the Information Flow Framework (IFF). In particular, this first paper provides a foundation that connects elements of the ERA data model with components of the first-order logical environment FOLE, and the second paper provides a superstructure that extends FOLE to the formalisms of first-order logic. The third paper defines an interpretation of FOLE in terms of the transformational passage, first described in (Kent 2013), from the classification form of first-order logic to an equivalent interpretation form, thereby defining the formalism and semantics of first-order logical/relational database systems (Kent 2011). The FOLE representation follows a conceptual structures approach, that is completely compatible with formal concept analysis (Ganter and Wille 1999) and information flow (Barwise and Seligman 1997).",0
"Reinforcement learning treats each input, feature, or stimulus as having a positive or negative reward value. Some stimuli, however, negate or inhibit the values of certain other predictors (excitors) when presented with them, but are otherwise neutral. We show that both linear and non-linear value-function approximators assign inhibitory features a strong value with the opposite valence of the predictor it inhibits (i.e., inhibitor= -excitor). In one circumstance, this gives a correct prediction (i.e., excitor + inhibitor = neutral outcome). Importantly, however, value-function approximators incorrectly predict that when the inhibitor is presented alone, a negative or oppositely valenced outcome will follow whereas the inhibitor alone is actually followed by a neutral outcome. Essentially, we show that having reward value as a direct predictive target can make inhibitors indistinguishable from excitors that predict the oppositely valenced outcome. We show that this problem can be easily avoided if the reinforcement learning problem is broken into 1) a supervised learning module that predicts the positive appearance of primary reinforcements and 2) a reinforcement learning module which sums their agent-defined values.",0
"A weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP) is a constraint satisfaction problem in which preferences among solutions can be expressed. Bucket elimination is a complete technique commonly used to solve this kind of constraint satisfaction problem. When the memory required to apply bucket elimination is too high, a heuristic method based on it (denominated mini-buckets) can be used to calculate bounds for the optimal solution. Nevertheless, the curse of dimensionality makes these techniques impractical on large scale problems. In response to this situation, we present a memetic algorithm for WCSPs in which bucket elimination is used as a mechanism for recombining solutions, providing the best possible child from the parental set. Subsequently, a multi-level model in which this exact/metaheuristic hybrid is further hybridized with branch-and-bound techniques and mini-buckets is studied. As a case study, we have applied these algorithms to the resolution of the maximum density still life problem, a hard constraint optimization problem based on Conways game of life. The resulting algorithm consistently finds optimal patterns for up to date solved instances in less time than current approaches. Moreover, it is shown that this proposal provides new best known solutions for very large instances.",0
"In this paper we present an OCR for Handwritten Devnagari Characters. Basic symbols are recognized by neural classifier. We have used four feature extraction techniques namely, intersection, shadow feature, chain code histogram and straight line fitting features. Shadow features are computed globally for character image while intersection features, chain code histogram features and line fitting features are computed by dividing the character image into different segments. Weighted majority voting technique is used for combining the classification decision obtained from four Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) based classifier. On experimentation with a dataset of 4900 samples the overall recognition rate observed is 92.80% as we considered top five choices results. This method is compared with other recent methods for Handwritten Devnagari Character Recognition and it has been observed that this approach has better success rate than other methods.",0
"We consider apprenticeship learning, i.e., having an agent learn a task by observing an expert demonstrating the task in a partially observable environment when the model of the environment is uncertain. This setting is useful in applications where the explicit modeling of the environment is difficult, such as a dialogue system. We show that we can extract information about the environment model by inferring action selection process behind the demonstration, under the assumption that the expert is choosing optimal actions based on knowledge of the true model of the target environment. Proposed algorithms can achieve more accurate estimates of POMDP parameters and better policies from a short demonstration, compared to methods that learns only from the reaction from the environment.",1
"The talent scheduling problem is a simplified version of the real-world film shooting problem, which aims to determine a shooting sequence so as to minimize the total cost of the actors involved. In this article, we first formulate the problem as an integer linear programming model. Next, we devise a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-bound algorithm is enhanced by several accelerating techniques, including preprocessing, dominance rules and caching search states. Extensive experiments over two sets of benchmark instances suggest that our algorithm is superior to the current best exact algorithm. Finally, the impacts of different parameter settings are disclosed by some additional experiments.",0
"The CDOI outcome measure - a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument utilizing direct client feedback - was implemented in a large, real-world behavioral healthcare setting in order to evaluate previous findings from smaller controlled studies. PROs provide an alternative window into treatment effectiveness based on client perception and facilitate detection of problems/symptoms for which there is no discernible measure (e.g. pain). The principal focus of the study was to evaluate the utility of the CDOI for predictive modeling of outcomes in a live clinical setting. Implementation factors were also addressed within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior by linking adoption rates to implementation practices and clinician perceptions. The results showed that the CDOI does contain significant capacity to predict outcome delta over time based on baseline and early change scores in a large, real-world clinical setting, as suggested in previous research. The implementation analysis revealed a number of critical factors affecting successful implementation and adoption of the CDOI outcome measure, though there was a notable disconnect between clinician intentions and actual behavior. Most importantly, the predictive capacity of the CDOI underscores the utility of direct client feedback measures such as PROs and their potential use as the basis for next generation clinical decision support tools and personalized treatment approaches.",0
"Real life problems such as scheduling meeting between people at different locations can be modelled as distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Suitable and satisfactory solutions can then be found using constraint satisfaction algorithms which can be exhaustive (backtracking) or otherwise (local search). However, most research in this area tested their algorithms by simulation on a single PC with a single program entry point. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a truly distributed constraint solver based on a local search algorithm using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE) to enable communication between agents on different machines. Particularly, we discuss design and implementation issues related to truly distributed constraint solver which might not be critical when simulated on a single machine. Evaluation results indicate that our truly distributed constraint solver works well within the observed limitations when tested with various distributed CSPs. Our application can also incorporate any constraint solving algorithm with little modifications.",0
"Nowadays, represented by Deep Learning techniques, the field of machine learning is experiencing unprecedented prosperity and its influence is demonstrated in academia, industry and civil society. ""Intelligent"" has become a label which could not be neglected for most applications; celebrities and scientists also warned that the development of full artificial intelligence may spell the end of the human race. It seems that the answer to building a computer system that could automatically improve with experience is right on the next corner. While for AI and machine learning researchers, it is a consensus that we are not anywhere near the core technique which could bring the Terminator, Number 5 or R2D2 into real life, and there is not even a formal definition about what is intelligence, or one of its basic properties: Learning. Therefore, even though researchers know these concerns are not necessary currently, there is no generalized explanation about why these concerns are not necessary, and what properties people should take into account that would make these concerns to be necessary. In this paper, starts from analysing the relation between information and its representation, a necessary condition for a model to be a learning model is proposed. This condition and related future works could be used to verify whether a system is able to learn or not, and enrich our understanding of learning: one important property of Intelligence.",0
"Many large datasets exhibit power-law statistics: The web graph, social networks, text data, click through data etc. Their adjacency graphs are termed natural graphs, and are known to be difficult to partition. As a consequence most distributed algorithms on these graphs are communication intensive. Many algorithms on natural graphs involve an Allreduce: a sum or average of partitioned data which is then shared back to the cluster nodes. Examples include PageRank, spectral partitioning, and many machine learning algorithms including regression, factor (topic) models, and clustering. In this paper we describe an efficient and scalable Allreduce primitive for power-law data. We point out scaling problems with existing butterfly and round-robin networks for Sparse Allreduce, and show that a hybrid approach improves on both. Furthermore, we show that Sparse Allreduce stages should be nested instead of cascaded (as in the dense case). And that the optimum throughput Allreduce network should be a butterfly of heterogeneous degree where degree decreases with depth into the network. Finally, a simple replication scheme is introduced to deal with node failures. We present experiments showing significant improvements over existing systems such as PowerGraph and Hadoop.",0
"In this paper we show how the defense relation among abstract arguments can be used to encode the reasons for accepting arguments. After introducing a novel notion of defenses and defense graphs, we propose a defense semantics together with a new notion of defense equivalence of argument graphs, and compare defense equivalence with standard equivalence and strong equivalence, respectively. Then, based on defense semantics, we define two kinds of reasons for accepting arguments, i.e., direct reasons and root reasons, and a notion of root equivalence of argument graphs. Finally, we show how the notion of root equivalence can be used in argumentation summarization.",0
"Graph theoretical ideas are highly utilized by computer science fields especially data mining. In this field, a data structure can be designed in the form of tree which in turn utilized vertices and edges. Covering is a widely used form of data structure in data mining and covering-based rough sets provide a systematic approach to this type of data. In this paper, we study the connectedness of graphs through covering-based rough sets and apply it to connected matroids. First, we present an approach to inducing a covering by a graph, and then covering-based rough sets are employed to study the connectedness of the graph from the viewpoint of the approximation operators. Second, we construct a graph from a matroid, and find the matroid and the graph have the same connectedness, which makes us to apply connected graphs to study connected matroids. In summary, this paper provides a new approach to studying graph theory and matroid theory.",0
"We propose a supervised algorithm for generating type embeddings in the same semantic vector space as a given set of entity embeddings. The algorithm is agnostic to the derivation of the underlying entity embeddings. It does not require any manual feature engineering, generalizes well to hundreds of types and achieves near-linear scaling on Big Graphs containing many millions of triples and instances by virtue of an incremental execution. We demonstrate the utility of the embeddings on a type recommendation task, outperforming a non-parametric feature-agnostic baseline while achieving 15x speedup and near-constant memory usage on a full partition of DBpedia. Using state-of-the-art visualization, we illustrate the agreement of our extensionally derived DBpedia type embeddings with the manually curated domain ontology. Finally, we use the embeddings to probabilistically cluster about 4 million DBpedia instances into 415 types in the DBpedia ontology.",0
"This paper describes the realization of the Ontology Web Search Engine. The Ontology Web Search Engine is realizable as independent project and as a part of other projects. The main purpose of this paper is to present the Ontology Web Search Engine realization details as the part of the Semantic Web Expert System and to present the results of the Ontology Web Search Engine functioning. It is expected that the Semantic Web Expert System will be able to process ontologies from the Web, generate rules from these ontologies and develop its knowledge base.",0
"Penetration Testing is a methodology for assessing network security, by generating and executing possible hacking attacks. Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question is how to generate the attacks. This is naturally formulated as planning under uncertainty, i.e., under incomplete knowledge about the network configuration. Previous work uses classical planning, and requires costly pre-processes reducing this uncertainty by extensive application of scanning methods. By contrast, we herein model the attack planning problem in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). This allows to reason about the knowledge available, and to intelligently employ scanning actions as part of the attack. As one would expect, this accurate solution does not scale. We devise a method that relies on POMDPs to find good attacks on individual machines, which are then composed into an attack on the network as a whole. This decomposition exploits network structure to the extent possible, making targeted approximations (only) where needed. Evaluating this method on a suitably adapted industrial test suite, we demonstrate its effectiveness in both runtime and solution quality.",1
"This paper describes a technology to connect patients to information in the experiences of other patients by using the power of structured big data. The approach, implemented in the Abzooba Smart Health Informatics Platform (SHIP),is to distill concepts of facts and expressions from conversations and discussions in health social media forums, and use those distilled concepts in connecting patients to experiences and insights that are highly relevant to them in particular. We envision our work, in progress, to provide new and effective tools to exploit the richness of content in social media in health for outcomes research.",0
"The standard coherence criterion for lower previsions is expressed using an infinite number of linear constraints. For lower previsions that are essentially defined on some finite set of gambles on a finite possibility space, we present a reformulation of this criterion that only uses a finite number of constraints. Any such lower prevision is coherent if it lies within the convex polytope defined by these constraints. The vertices of this polytope are the extreme coherent lower previsions for the given set of gambles. Our reformulation makes it possible to compute them. We show how this is done and illustrate the procedure and its results.",0
"As historically acknowledged in the Reasoning about Actions and Change community, intuitiveness of a logical domain description cannot be fully automated. Moreover, like any other logical theory, action theories may also evolve, and thus knowledge engineers need revision methods to help in accommodating new incoming information about the behavior of actions in an adequate manner. The present work is about changing action domain descriptions in multimodal logic. Its contribution is threefold: first we revisit the semantics of action theory contraction proposed in previous work, giving more robust operators that express minimal change based on a notion of distance between Kripke-models. Second we give algorithms for syntactical action theory contraction and establish their correctness with respect to our semantics for those action theories that satisfy a principle of modularity investigated in previous work. Since modularity can be ensured for every action theory and, as we show here, needs to be computed at most once during the evolution of a domain description, it does not represent a limitation at all to the method here studied. Finally we state AGM-like postulates for action theory contraction and assess the behavior of our operators with respect to them. Moreover, we also address the revision counterpart of action theory change, showing that it benefits from our semantics for contraction.",0
"Motivated by the common academic problem of allocating papers to referees for conference reviewing we propose a novel mechanism for solving the assignment problem when we have a two sided matching problem with preferences from one side (the agents/reviewers) over the other side (the objects/papers) and both sides have capacity constraints. The assignment problem is a fundamental problem in both computer science and economics with application in many areas including task and resource allocation. We draw inspiration from multi-criteria decision making and voting and use order weighted averages (OWAs) to propose a novel and flexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem. We show an algorithm for finding a $\Sigma$-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of finding an egalitarian assignment. Inspired by this setting we observe an interesting connection between our model and the classic proportional multi-winner election problem in social choice.",0
"Many learning tasks combine perceptual and cognitive (e.g. logical, symbolic) sub-tasks. In some cases end-to-end learning of the perceptual and cognitive sub-tasks can be more difficult than learning each sub-task individually. In other cases such end-to-end learning can be very efficient. As end-to-end learning is becoming more prevalent in AI, it is important to understand when this approach can work efficiently.",1
"The article is devoted to the problem of inconsistency in the pairwise comparisons based prioritization methodology. The issue of ""inconsistency"" in this context has gained much attention in recent years. The literature provides us with a number of different ""inconsistency"" indices suggested for measuring the inconsistency of the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). The latter is understood as a deviation of the PCM from the consistent case - a notion that is formally well-defined in this theory. However the usage of the indices is justified only by some heuristics. It is still unclear what they really ""measure"". What is even more important and still not known is the relationship between their values and the ""consistency"" of the decision maker's judgments on one hand, and the prioritization results upon the other. We provide examples showing that it is necessary to distinguish between these three following tasks: the ""measuring"" of the ""PCM inconsistency"" and the PCM-based ""measuring"" of the consistency of decision maker's judgments and, finally, the ""measuring"" of the usefulness of the PCM as a source of information for estimation of the riority vector (PV). Next we focus on the third one, which seems to be the most important one in Multi-Criteria Decision Making. With the help of Monte Carlo experiments, we study the performance of various inconsistency indices as indicators of the final PV estimation quality. The presented results allow a deeper understanding of the information contained in these indices and help in choosing a proper one in a given situation. They also enable us to develop a new inconsistency characteristic and, based on it, to propose the PCM acceptance approach that is supported by the lassical statistical methodology.",0
"Noisy probabilistic relational rules are a promising world model representation for several reasons. They are compact and generalize over world instantiations. They are usually interpretable and they can be learned effectively from the action experiences in complex worlds. We investigate reasoning with such rules in grounded relational domains. Our algorithms exploit the compactness of rules for efficient and flexible decision-theoretic planning. As a first approach, we combine these rules with the Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT) algorithm based on look-ahead trees. Our second approach converts these rules into a structured dynamic Bayesian network representation and predicts the effects of action sequences using approximate inference and beliefs over world states. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches for planning in a simulated complex 3D robot manipulation scenario with an articulated manipulator and realistic physics and in domains of the probabilistic planning competition. Empirical results show that our methods can solve problems where existing methods fail.",0
"Multi-tenancy hosting of users in cloud NoSQL data stores is favored by cloud providers because it enables resource sharing at low operating cost. Multi-tenancy takes several forms depending on whether the back-end file system is a local file system (LFS) or a parallel file system (PFS), and on whether tenants are independent or share data across tenants. In this thesis I focus on and propose solutions to two cases: independent data-local file system, and shared data-parallel file system.",0
"We introduce a novel generalization of Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) and instantiate it to yield a novel, competitive algorithm for solving Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). Current QBF solvers based on counterexample-guided expansion use a recursive approach which scales poorly with the number of quantifier alternations. Our generalization of CEGIS removes the need for this recursive approach, and we instantiate it to yield a simple and efficient algorithm for QBF solving. Lastly, this research is supported by a competitive, though straightforward, implementation of the algorithm, making it possible to study the practical impact of our algorithm design decisions, along with various optimizations.",0
"Game tree search algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), require access to a forward model (or ""simulator"") of the game at hand. However, in some games such forward model is not readily available. This paper presents three forward models for two-player attrition games, which we call ""combat models"", and show how they can be used to simulate combat in RTS games. We also show how these combat models can be learned from replay data. We use StarCraft as our application domain. We report experiments comparing our combat models predicting a combat output and their impact when used for tactical decisions during a real game.",0
"In general, the best explanation for a given observation makes no promises on how good it is with respect to other alternative explanations. A major deficiency of message-passing schemes for belief revision in Bayesian networks is their inability to generate alternatives beyond the second best. In this paper, we present a general approach based on linear constraint systems that naturally generates alternative explanations in an orderly and highly efficient manner. This approach is then applied to cost-based abduction problems as well as belief revision in Bayesian net works.",0
"TD(0) is one of the most commonly used algorithms in reinforcement learning. Despite this, there is no existing finite sample analysis for TD(0) with function approximation, even for the linear case. Our work is the first to provide such a result. Works that managed to obtain concentration bounds for online Temporal Difference (TD) methods analyzed modified versions of them, carefully crafted for the analyses to hold. These modifications include projections and step-sizes dependent on unknown problem parameters. Our analysis obviates these artificial alterations by exploiting strong properties of TD(0) and tailor-made stochastic approximation tools.",0
"Reconstruction of the tridimensional geometry of a visual scene using the binocular disparity information is an important issue in computer vision and mobile robotics, which can be formulated as a Bayesian inference problem. However, computation of the full disparity distribution with an advanced Bayesian model is usually an intractable problem, and proves computationally challenging even with a simple model. In this paper, we show how probabilistic hardware using distributed memory and alternate representation of data as stochastic bitstreams can solve that problem with high performance and energy efficiency. We put forward a way to express discrete probability distributions using stochastic data representations and perform Bayesian fusion using those representations, and show how that approach can be applied to diparity computation. We evaluate the system using a simulated stochastic implementation and discuss possible hardware implementations of such architectures and their potential for sensorimotor processing and robotics.",0
"Graphical models are usually learned without regard to the cost of doing inference with them. As a result, even if a good model is learned, it may perform poorly at prediction, because it requires approximate inference. We propose an alternative: learning models with a score function that directly penalizes the cost of inference. Specifically, we learn arithmetic circuits with a penalty on the number of edges in the circuit (in which the cost of inference is linear). Our algorithm is equivalent to learning a Bayesian network with context-specific independence by greedily splitting conditional distributions, at each step scoring the candidates by compiling the resulting network into an arithmetic circuit, and using its size as the penalty. We show how this can be done efficiently, without compiling a circuit from scratch for each candidate. Experiments on several real-world domains show that our algorithm is able to learn tractable models with very large treewidth, and yields more accurate predictions than a standard context-specific Bayesian network learner, in far less time.",0
"Wildfires are frequent, devastating events in Australia that regularly cause significant loss of life and widespread property damage. Fire weather indices are a widely-adopted method for measuring fire danger and they play a significant role in issuing bushfire warnings and in anticipating demand for bushfire management resources. Existing systems that calculate fire weather indices are limited due to low spatial and temporal resolution. Localized wireless sensor networks, on the other hand, gather continuous sensor data measuring variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed at high resolutions. However, using wireless sensor networks to estimate fire weather indices is a challenge due to data quality issues, lack of standard data formats and lack of agreement on thresholds and methods for calculating fire weather indices. Within the scope of this paper, we propose a standardized approach to calculating Fire Weather Indices (a.k.a. fire danger ratings) and overcome a number of the challenges by applying Semantic Web Technologies to the processing of data streams from a wireless sensor network deployed in the Springbrook region of South East Queensland. This paper describes the underlying ontologies, the semantic reasoning and the Semantic Fire Weather Index (SFWI) system that we have developed to enable domain experts to specify and adapt rules for calculating Fire Weather Indices. We also describe the Web-based mapping interface that we have developed, that enables users to improve their understanding of how fire weather indices vary over time within a particular region.Finally, we discuss our evaluation results that indicate that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision and query performance.",0
"Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a dependability analysis technique that has been widely used to predict reliability, availability and safety of many complex engineering systems. Traditionally, these FTA-based analyses are done using paper-and-pencil proof methods or computer simulations, which cannot ascertain absolute correctness due to their inherent limitations. As a complementary approach, we propose to use the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL4 to conduct the FTA-based analysis of safety-critical systems where accuracy of failure analysis is a dire need. In particular, the paper presents a higher-order-logic formalization of generic Fault Tree gates, i.e., AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and NOT and the formal verification of their failure probability expressions. Moreover, we have formally verified the generic probabilistic inclusion-exclusion principle, which is one of the foremost requirements for conducting the FTA-based failure analysis of any given system. For illustration purposes, we conduct the FTA-based failure analysis of a solar array that is used as the main source of power for the Dong Fang Hong-3 (DFH-3) satellite.",0
"An accurate prediction of crude oil prices over long future horizons is challenging and of great interest to governments, enterprises, and investors. This paper proposes a revised hybrid model built upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on the feed-forward neural network (FNN) modeling framework incorporating the slope-based method (SBM), which is capable of capturing the complex dynamic of crude oil prices. Three commonly used multi-step-ahead prediction strategies proposed in the literature, including iterated strategy, direct strategy, and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) strategy, are examined and compared, and practical considerations for the selection of a prediction strategy for multi-step-ahead forecasting relating to crude oil prices are identified. The weekly data from the WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil spot price are used to compare the performance of the alternative models under the EMD-SBM-FNN modeling framework with selected counterparts. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed on the basis of prediction accuracy and computational cost. The results obtained in this study indicate that the proposed EMD-SBM-FNN model using the MIMO strategy is the best in terms of prediction accuracy with accredited computational load.",0
"The research of attribute characters in information system which contains core, necessary, unnecessary is a basic and important issue in attribute reduct. Many methods for the judgement of attribute characters are based on the relationship between the objects and attributes. In this paper, a new type of judgement theorems which are absolutely based on the relationship among attributes is proposed for the judgement of attribute characters. The method is through comparing the two new attribute sets $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ with respect to the designated attribute $a$ which is proposed in this paper. We conclude that which type of the attribute $a$ belongs to is determined by the relationship between $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in essence. Secondly, more concise and clear results are given about the judgment of the attribute characters through analyzing the properties of refinement and precise-refinement between $E(a)$ and $N(a)$ in topology. In addition, the relationship among attributes are discussed which is useful for constructing a reduct in the last section of this paper. In the last, we propose a reduct algorithm based on $E(a)$, and this algorithm is an extended application of the analysis of attribute characters above.",0
"Nogood learning is a powerful approach to reducing search in Constraint Programming (CP) solvers. The current state of the art, called Lazy Clause Generation (LCG), uses resolution to derive nogoods expressing the reasons for each search failure. Such nogoods can prune other parts of the search tree, producing exponential speedups on a wide variety of problems. Nogood learning solvers can be seen as resolution proof systems. The stronger the proof system, the faster it can solve a CP problem. It has recently been shown that the proof system used in LCG is at least as strong as general resolution. However, stronger proof systems such as \emph{extended resolution} exist. Extended resolution allows for literals expressing arbitrary logical concepts over existing variables to be introduced and can allow exponentially smaller proofs than general resolution. The primary problem in using extended resolution is to figure out exactly which literals are useful to introduce. In this paper, we show that we can use the structural information contained in a CP model in order to introduce useful literals, and that this can translate into significant speedups on a range of problems.",0
"The KF metamodel is a comprehensive unifying metamodel covering the static structural entities and constraints of UML Class Diagrams (v2.4.1), ER, EER, ORM, and ORM2, and intended to boost interoperability of common conceptual data modelling languages. It was originally designed in UML with textual constraints, and in this report we present its formalisations in FOL and OWL, which accompanies the paper that describes, discusses, and analyses the KF metamodel in detail. These new formalizations contribute to give a precise meaning to the metamodel, to understand its complexity properties and to provide a basis for future implementations.",0
"The variability of structure in a finite Markov equivalence class of causally sufficient models represented by directed acyclic graphs has been fully characterized. Without causal sufficiency, an infinite semi-Markov equivalence class of models has only been characterized by the fact that each model in the equivalence class entails the same marginal statistical dependencies. In this paper, we study the variability of structure of causal models within a semi-Markov equivalence class and propose a systematic approach to construct models entailing any specific marginal statistical dependencies.",0
"Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is widely applied to uncertainty modelling and knowledge reasoning because of its advantages in dealing with uncertain information. But some conditions or requirements, such as exclusiveness hypothesis and completeness constraint, limit the development and application of that theory to a large extend. To overcome the shortcomings and enhance its capability of representing the uncertainty, a novel model, called D numbers, has been proposed recently. However, many key issues, for example how to implement the combination of D numbers, remain unsolved. In the paper, we have explored the combination of D Numbers from a perspective of conflict redistribution, and proposed two combination rules being suitable for different situations for the fusion of two D numbers. The proposed combination rules can reduce to the classical Dempster's rule in Dempster-Shafer theory under a certain conditions. Numerical examples and discussion about the proposed rules are also given in the paper.",0
"One-sided matching mechanisms are fundamental for assigning a set of indivisible objects to a set of self-interested agents when monetary transfers are not allowed. Two widely-studied randomized mechanisms in multiagent settings are the Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD) and the Probabilistic Serial Rule (PS). Both mechanisms require only that agents specify ordinal preferences and have a number of desirable economic and computational properties. However, the induced outcomes of the mechanisms are often incomparable and thus there are challenges when it comes to deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper, we first consider the space of general ordinal preferences and provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS. We analyze their respective economic properties under general and lexicographic preferences. We then instantiate utility functions with the goal of gaining insights on the manipulability, efficiency, and envyfreeness of the mechanisms under different risk-attitude models. Our results hold under various preference distribution models, which further confirm the broad use of RSD in most practical applications.",0
"Creativity is a complex, multi-faceted concept encompassing a variety of related aspects, abilities, properties and behaviours. If we wish to study creativity scientifically, then a tractable and well-articulated model of creativity is required. Such a model would be of great value to researchers investigating the nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with the evaluation of creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to developing a suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on the words people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field of statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of fourteen key components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of academic papers on the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly often in connection with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical similarity to help cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of creativity. The components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building blocks which can be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains. The components have been employed in two case studies to evaluate the creativity of computational systems and have proven useful in articulating achievements of this work and directions for further research.",0
"We describe the solution of team ISMLL for the ECML-PKDD 2016 Discovery Challenge on Bank Card Usage for both tasks. Our solution is based on three pillars.

This approach achieved the best performance on the public leaderboard for the first task and a decent fourth position for the second task.",0
"Existing work in multi-agent collision prediction and avoidance typically assumes discrete-time trajectories with Gaussian uncertainty or that are completely deterministic. We propose an approach that allows detection of collisions even between continuous, stochastic trajectories with the only restriction that means and covariances can be computed. To this end, we employ probabilistic bounds to derive criterion functions whose negative sign provably is indicative of probable collisions. For criterion functions that are Lipschitz, an algorithm is provided to rapidly find negative values or prove their absence. We propose an iterative policy-search approach that avoids prior discretisations and yields collision-free trajectories with adjustably high certainty. We test our method with both fixed-priority and auction-based protocols for coordinating the iterative planning process. Results are provided in collision-avoidance simulations of feedback controlled plants.",0
"We explore how computational ontologies can be impactful vis-a-vis the developing discipline of ""data science."" We posit an approach wherein management theories are represented as formal axioms, and then applied to draw inferences about data that reside in corporate databases. That is, management theories would be implemented as rules within a data analytics engine. We demonstrate a case study development of such an ontology by formally representing an accounting theory in First-Order Logic. Though quite preliminary, the idea that an information technology, namely ontologies, can potentially actualize the academic cliche, ""From Theory to Practice,"" and be applicable to the burgeoning domain of data analytics is novel and exciting.",0
"In the decade since Jeff Hawkins proposed Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) as a model of neocortical computation, the theory and the algorithms have evolved dramatically. This paper presents a detailed description of HTM's Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA), including for the first time a rigorous mathematical formulation of all aspects of the computations. Prediction Assisted CLA (paCLA), a refinement of the CLA is presented, which is both closer to the neuroscience and adds significantly to the computational power. Finally, we summarise the key functions of neocortex which are expressed in paCLA implementations.",0
This paper is devoted to expressiveness of hypergraphs for which uncertainty propagation by local computations via Shenoy/Shafer method applies. It is demonstrated that for this propagation method for a given joint belief distribution no valuation of hyperedges of a hypergraph may provide with simpler hypergraph structure than valuation of hyperedges by conditional distributions. This has vital implication that methods recovering belief networks from data have no better alternative for finding the simplest hypergraph structure for belief propagation. A method for recovery tree-structured belief networks has been developed and specialized for Dempster-Shafer belief functions,0
"In this paper we promote introducing software verification and control flow graph similarity measurement in automated evaluation of students' programs. We present a new grading framework that merges results obtained by combination of these two approaches with results obtained by automated testing, leading to improved quality and precision of automated grading. These two approaches are also useful in providing a comprehensible feedback that can help students to improve the quality of their programs We also present our corresponding tools that are publicly available and open source. The tools are based on LLVM low-level intermediate code representation, so they could be applied to a number of programming languages. Experimental evaluation of the proposed grading framework is performed on a corpus of university students' programs written in programming language C. Results of the experiments show that automatically generated grades are highly correlated with manually determined grades suggesting that the presented tools can find real-world applications in studying and grading.",0
"Combinatorial decision problems arise in many different domains such as scheduling, routing, packing, bioinformatics, and many more. Despite recent advances in developing scalable solvers, there are still many problems which are often very hard to solve. Typically the most advanced solvers include elements which are stochastic in nature. If a same instance is solved many times using different seeds then depending on the inherent characteristics of a problem instance and the solver, one can observe a highly-variant distribution of times spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore, to solve a problem instance efficiently it is often useful to solve the same instance in parallel with different seeds. With the proliferation of cloud computing, it is natural to think about an elastic solver which can scale up by launching searches in parallel on thousands of machines (or cores). However, this could result in consuming a lot of energy. Moreover, not every instance would require thousands of machines. The challenge is to resolve the tradeoff between solution time and energy consumption optimally for a given problem instance. We analyse the impact of the number of machines (or cores) on not only solution time but also on energy consumption. We highlight that although solution time always drops as the number of machines increases, the relation between the number of machines and energy consumption is more complicated. In many cases, the optimal energy consumption may be achieved by a middle ground, we analyse this relationship in detail. The tradeoff between solution time and energy consumption is studied further, showing that the energy consumption of a solver can be reduced drastically if we increase the solution time marginally. We also develop a prediction model, demonstrating that such insights can be exploited to achieve faster solutions times in a more energy efficient manor.",0
"There has been an increasing interest in inferring some personality traits from users and players in social networks and games, respectively. This goes beyond classical sentiment analysis, and also much further than customer profiling. The purpose here is to have a characterisation of users in terms of personality traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. While this is an incipient area of research, we ask the question of whether cognitive abilities, and intelligence in particular, are also measurable from user profiles. However, we pose the question as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of universal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in this paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the intelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just from their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive tests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine intelligence tests?",0
"In this work, we present a methodology that enables an agent to make efficient use of its exploratory actions by autonomously identifying possible objectives in its environment and learning them in parallel. The identification of objectives is achieved using an online and unsupervised adaptive clustering algorithm. The identified objectives are learned (at least partially) in parallel using Q-learning. Using a simulated agent and environment, it is shown that the converged or partially converged value function weights resulting from off-policy learning can be used to accumulate knowledge about multiple objectives without any additional exploration. We claim that the proposed approach could be useful in scenarios where the objectives are initially unknown or in real world scenarios where exploration is typically a time and energy intensive process. The implications and possible extensions of this work are also briefly discussed.",0
"First-order knowledge compilation techniques have proven efficient for lifted inference. They compile a relational probability model into a target circuit on which many inference queries can be answered efficiently. Early methods used data structures as their target circuit. In our KR-2016 paper, we showed that compiling to a low-level program instead of a data structure offers orders of magnitude speedup, resulting in the state-of-the-art lifted inference technique. In this paper, we conduct experiments to address two questions regarding our KR-2016 results: 1- does the speedup come from more efficient compilation or more efficient reasoning with the target circuit?, and 2- why are low-level programs more efficient target circuits than data structures?",0
"This paper introduces a methodology that applies to solve graph edge-coloring problems and in particular to prove that the Ramsey number $R(4,3,3)=30$. The number $R(4,3,3)$ is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with the best chances of being found ""soon"". Yet, it has been sought after for more than 50 years. The proposed technique is based on two well-studied concepts, \emph{abstraction} and \emph{symmetry}. First, we introduce an abstraction on graph colorings, \emph{degree matrices}, that specify the degree of each vertex in each color. We compute, using a SAT solver, an over-approximation of the set of degree matrices of all solutions of the graph coloring problem. Then, for each degree matrix in the over-approximation, we compute, again using a SAT solver, the set of all solutions with matching degrees. Breaking symmetries, on degree matrices in the first step and with respect to graph isomorphism in the second, is cardinal to the success of the approach. We illustrate two applications: to prove that $R(4,3,3)=30$ and to compute the, previously unknown number, 78{,}892, of $(3,3,3;13)$ Ramsey colorings.",0
"This work presents CLTune, an auto-tuner for OpenCL kernels. It evaluates and tunes kernel performance of a generic, user-defined search space of possible parameter-value combinations. Example parameters include the OpenCL workgroup size, vector data-types, tile sizes, and loop unrolling factors. CLTune can be used in the following scenarios: 1) when there are too many tunable parameters to explore manually, 2) when performance portability across OpenCL devices is desired, or 3) when the optimal parameters change based on input argument values (e.g. matrix dimensions). The auto-tuner is generic, easy to use, open-source, and supports multiple search strategies including simulated annealing and particle swarm optimisation. CLTune is evaluated on two GPU case-studies inspired by the recent successes in deep learning: 2D convolution and matrix-multiplication (GEMM). For 2D convolution, we demonstrate the need for auto-tuning by optimizing for different filter sizes, achieving performance on-par or better than the state-of-the-art. For matrix-multiplication, we use CLTune to explore a parameter space of more than two-hundred thousand configurations, we show the need for device-specific tuning, and outperform the clBLAS library on NVIDIA, AMD and Intel GPUs.",0
"In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in video images using Visual Vocabulary model and Bag of Words and track our object of interest in the subsequent video frames using species inspired PSO. Initially, the shadow free images are obtained by background modelling followed by foreground modeling to extract the blobs of our object of interest. Subsequently, we train a cubic SVM with human body datasets in accordance with our domain of interest for recognition and tracking. During training, using the principle of Bag of Words we extract necessary features of certain domains and objects for classification. Subsequently, matching these feature sets with those of the extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow free background from the foreground, we detect successfully our object of interest from the test domain. The performance of the classification by cubic SVM is satisfactorily represented by confusion matrix and ROC curve reflecting the accuracy of each module. After classification, our object of interest is tracked in the test domain using species inspired PSO. By combining the adaptive learning tools with the efficient classification of description, we achieve optimum accuracy in recognition of the moving objects. We evaluate our algorithm benchmark datasets: iLIDS, VIVID, Walking2, Woman. Comparative analysis of our algorithm against the existing state-of-the-art trackers shows very satisfactory and competitive results.",0
"A checkers-like model game with a simplified set of rules is studied through extensive simulations of agents with different expertise and strategies. The introduction of complementary strategies, in a quite general way, provides a tool to mimic the basic ingredients of a wide scope of real games. We find that only for the player having the higher offensive expertise (the dominant player ), maximizing the offensive always increases the probability to win. For the non-dominant player, interestingly, a complete minimization of the offensive becomes the best way to win in many situations, depending on the relative values of the defense expertise. Further simulations on the interplay of defense expertise were done separately, in the context of a fully-offensive scenario, offering a starting point for analytical treatments. In particular, we established that in this scenario the total number of moves is defined only by the player with the lower defensive expertise. We believe that these results stand for a first step towards a new way to improve decisions-making in a large number of zero-sum real games.",0

"Passengers' experience is becoming a key metric to evaluate the air transportation system's performance. Efficient and robust tools to handle airport operations are needed along with a better understanding of passengers' interests and concerns. Among various airport operations, this paper studies airport gate scheduling for improved passengers' experience. Three objectives accounting for passengers, aircraft, and operation are presented. Trade-offs between these objectives are analyzed, and a balancing objective function is proposed. The results show that the balanced objective can improve the efficiency of traffic flow in passenger terminals and on ramps, as well as the robustness of gate operations.",0
"Bipartite ranking aims to learn a real-valued ranking function that orders positive instances before negative instances. Recent efforts of bipartite ranking are focused on optimizing ranking accuracy at the top of the ranked list. Most existing approaches are either to optimize task specific metrics or to extend the ranking loss by emphasizing more on the error associated with the top ranked instances, leading to a high computational cost that is super-linear in the number of training instances. We propose a highly efficient approach, titled TopPush, for optimizing accuracy at the top that has computational complexity linear in the number of training instances. We present a novel analysis that bounds the generalization error for the top ranked instances for the proposed approach. Empirical study shows that the proposed approach is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art approaches and is 10-100 times faster.",1
"The context of a software developer is something hard to define and capture, as it represents a complex network of elements across different dimensions that are not limited to the work developed on an IDE. We propose the definition of a software developer context model that takes into account all the dimensions that characterize the work environment of the developer. We are especially focused on what the software developer context encompasses at the project level and how it can be captured. The experimental work done so far show that useful context information can be extracted from project management tools. The extraction, analysis and availability of this context information can be used to enrich the work environment of the developer with additional knowledge to support her/his work.",0
"Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a rich framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty in stochastic domains. However, solving a POMDP is often intractable except for small problems due to their complexity. Here, we focus on online approaches that alleviate the computational complexity by computing good local policies at each decision step during the execution. Online algorithms generally consist of a lookahead search to find the best action to execute at each time step in an environment. Our objectives here are to survey the various existing online POMDP methods, analyze their properties and discuss their advantages and disadvantages; and to thoroughly evaluate these online approaches in different environments under various metrics (return, error bound reduction, lower bound improvement). Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art online heuristic search methods can handle large POMDP domains efficiently.",0
"Despite the recent success of neural networks in tasks involving natural language understanding (NLU) there has only been limited progress in some of the fundamental challenges of NLU, such as the disambiguation of the meaning and function of words in context. This work approaches this problem by incorporating contextual information into word representations prior to processing the task at hand. To this end we propose a general-purpose reading architecture that is employed prior to a task-specific NLU model. It is responsible for refining context-agnostic word representations with contextual information and lends itself to the introduction of additional, context-relevant information from external knowledge sources. We demonstrate that previously non-competitive models benefit dramatically from employing contextual representations, closing the gap between general-purpose reading architectures and the state-of-the-art performance obtained with fine-tuned, task-specific architectures. Apart from our empirical results we present a comprehensive analysis of the computed representations which gives insights into the kind of information added during the refinement process.",0
"Deep learning classifiers are known to be inherently vulnerable to manipulation by intentionally perturbed inputs, named adversarial examples. In this work, we establish that reinforcement learning techniques based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are also vulnerable to adversarial input perturbations, and verify the transferability of adversarial examples across different DQN models. Furthermore, we present a novel class of attacks based on this vulnerability that enable policy manipulation and induction in the learning process of DQNs. We propose an attack mechanism that exploits the transferability of adversarial examples to implement policy induction attacks on DQNs, and demonstrate its efficacy and impact through experimental study of a game-learning scenario.",0
"The Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) is an influential brain-inspired computing model in many relevant fields. Since its inception in the 1970s, the model has been intensively studied and many variants of the prototype, such as Kernel-CMAC, Self-Organizing Map CMAC, and Linguistic CMAC, have been proposed. This review article focus on how the CMAC model is gradually developed and refined to meet the demand of fast, adaptive, and robust control. Two perspective, CMAC as a neural network and CMAC as a table look-up technique are presented. Three aspects of the model: the architecture, learning algorithms and applications are discussed. In the end, some potential future research directions on this model are suggested.",0
"Artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is one of the swarm intelligence optimization algorithms that works based on population and stochastic search. In order to achieve acceptable result, there are many parameters needs to be adjusted in AFSA. Among these parameters, visual and step are very significant in view of the fact that artificial fish basically move based on these parameters. In standard AFSA, these two parameters remain constant until the algorithm termination. Large values of these parameters increase the capability of algorithm in global search, while small values improve the local search ability of the algorithm. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of the AFSA and different approaches to balance between local and global exploration have been tested based on the adaptive modification of visual and step during algorithm execution. The proposed approaches have been evaluated based on the four well-known benchmark functions. Experimental results show considerable positive impact on the performance of AFSA.",0
"The process of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is of determining the best choice among all of the probable alternatives. The problem of supplier selection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via single valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed method is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single valued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed method, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application of single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.",0
"Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is an efficient no-regret learning algorithm for decision problems modeled as extensive games. CFR's regret bounds depend on the requirement of perfect recall: players always remember information that was revealed to them and the order in which it was revealed. In games without perfect recall, however, CFR's guarantees do not apply. In this paper, we present the first regret bound for CFR when applied to a general class of games with imperfect recall. In addition, we show that CFR applied to any abstraction belonging to our general class results in a regret bound not just for the abstract game, but for the full game as well. We verify our theory and show how imperfect recall can be used to trade a small increase in regret for a significant reduction in memory in three domains: die-roll poker, phantom tic-tac-toe, and Bluff.",1
"The World Wide Web continues to evolve and serve as the infrastructure for carrying massive amounts of multimodal and multisensory observations. These observations capture various situations pertinent to people's needs and interests along with all their idiosyncrasies. To support human-centered computing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look towards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward this goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual computing. In our view, these offer a continuum to make the most out of vast, growing, and diverse data pertinent to human needs and interests. We propose details of perceptual computing characterized by interpretation and exploration operations comparable to the interleaving of bottom and top brain processing.",0
"The past few years have witnessed a growth in size and computational requirements for training and inference with neural networks. Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a method which learns to optimize device placement for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the sequence-to-sequence model. Our main result is that on Inception-V3 for ImageNet classification, and on RNN LSTM, for language modeling and neural machine translation, our model finds non-trivial device placements that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algorithmic methods.",1
"When the information about uncertainty cannot be quantified in a simple, probabilistic way, the topic of possibilistic decision theory is often a natural one to consider. The development of possibilistic decision theory has lead to a series of possibilistic criteria, e.g pessimistic possibilistic qualitative utility, possibilistic likely dominance, binary possibilistic utility and possibilistic Choquet integrals. This paper focuses on sequential decision making in possibilistic decision trees. It proposes a complexity study of the problem of finding an optimal strategy depending on the monotonicity property of the optimization criteria which allows the application of dynamic programming that offers a polytime reduction of the decision problem. It also shows that possibilistic Choquet integrals do not satisfy this property, and that in this case the optimization problem is NP - hard.",0
"To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models of what the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible or expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition. Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the possible plans the other agents may be following, and develop special techniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supporting inference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, we describe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible procedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic belief networks.",0
"Epistemic logic has become a major field of philosophical logic ever since the groundbreaking work by Hintikka (1962). Despite its various successful applications in theoretical computer science, AI, and game theory, the technical development of the field has been mainly focusing on the propositional part, i.e., the propositional modal logics of ""knowing that"". However, knowledge is expressed in everyday life by using various other locutions such as ""knowing whether"", ""knowing what"", ""knowing how"" and so on (knowing-wh hereafter). Such knowledge expressions are better captured in quantified epistemic logic, as was already discussed by Hintikka (1962) and his sequel works at length. This paper aims to draw the attention back again to such a fascinating but largely neglected topic. We first survey what Hintikka and others did in the literature of quantified epistemic logic, and then advocate a new quantifier-free approach to study the epistemic logics of knowing-wh, which we believe can balance expressivity and complexity, and capture the essential reasoning patterns about knowing-wh. We survey our recent line of work on the epistemic logics of ""knowing whether"", ""knowing what"" and ""knowing how"" to demonstrate the use of this new approach.",0
"While Monte Carlo Tree Search and closely related methods have dominated General Video Game Playing, recent research has demonstrated the promise of Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms as an interesting alternative. However, there is little attention paid to population initialization techniques in the setting of general real-time video games. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of population seeding to improve the performance of Rolling Horizon Evolution and presents the results of two methods, One Step Look Ahead and Monte Carlo Tree Search, tested on 20 games of the General Video Game AI corpus with multiple evolution parameter values (population size and individual length). An in-depth analysis is carried out between the results of the seeding methods and the vanilla Rolling Horizon Evolution. In addition, the paper presents a comparison to a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. The results are promising, with seeding able to boost performance significantly over baseline evolution and even match the high level of play obtained by the Monte Carlo Tree Search.",0
"This article constructs a Turing Machine which can solve for $\beta^{'}$ which is RE-complete. Such a machine is only possible if there is something wrong with the foundations of computer science and mathematics. We therefore check our work by looking very closely at Cantor's diagonalization and construct a novel formal language as an Abelian group which allows us, through equivalence relations, to provide a non-trivial counterexample to Cantor's argument. As if that wasn't enough, we then discover that the impredicative nature of G\""odel's diagonalization lemma leads to logical tautology, invalidating any meaning behind the method, leaving no doubt that diagonalization is flawed. Our discovery in regards to these foundational arguments opens the door to solving the P vs NP problem.",0
"In practice, a ranking of objects with respect to given set of criteria is of considerable importance. However, due to lack of knowledge, information of time pressure, decision makers might not be able to provide a (crisp) ranking of objects from the top to the bottom. Instead, some objects might be ranked equally, or better than other objects only to some degree. In such cases, a generalization of crisp rankings to fuzzy rankings can be more useful. The aim of the article is to introduce the notion of a fuzzy ranking and to discuss its several properties, namely orderings, similarity and indecisiveness. The proposed approach can be used both for group decision making or multiple criteria decision making when uncertainty is involved.",0
"Topic models are a way to discover underlying themes in an otherwise unstructured collection of documents. In this study, we specifically used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model on a dataset of Yelp reviews to classify restaurants based off of their reviews. Furthermore, we hypothesize that within a city, restaurants can be grouped into similar ""clusters"" based on both location and similarity. We used several different clustering methods, including K-means Clustering and a Probabilistic Mixture Model, in order to uncover and classify districts, both well-known and hidden (i.e. cultural areas like Chinatown or hearsay like ""the best street for Italian restaurants"") within a city. We use these models to display and label different clusters on a map. We also introduce a topic similarity heatmap that displays the similarity distribution in a city to a new restaurant.",0
"The currently most efficient algorithm for inference with a probabilistic network builds upon a triangulation of a network's graph. In this paper, we show that pre-processing can help in finding good triangulations forprobabilistic networks, that is, triangulations with a minimal maximum clique size. We provide a set of rules for stepwise reducing a graph, without losing optimality. This reduction allows us to solve the triangulation problem on a smaller graph. From the smaller graph's triangulation, a triangulation of the original graph is obtained by reversing the reduction steps. Our experimental results show that the graphs of some well-known real-life probabilistic networks can be triangulated optimally just by preprocessing; for other networks, huge reductions in their graph's size are obtained.",0
"This paper presents an axiomatic framework for qualitative decision under uncertainty in a finite setting. The corresponding utility is expressed by a sup-min expression, called Sugeno (or fuzzy) integral. Technically speaking, Sugeno integral is a median, which is indeed a qualitative counterpart to the averaging operation underlying expected utility. The axiomatic justification of Sugeno integral-based utility is expressed in terms of preference between acts as in Savage decision theory. Pessimistic and optimistic qualitative utilities, based on necessity and possibility measures, previously introduced by two of the authors, can be retrieved in this setting by adding appropriate axioms.",0
"Recently it has been shown that policy-gradient methods for reinforcement learning can be utilized to train deep end-to-end systems directly on non-differentiable metrics for the task at hand. In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing image captioning systems using reinforcement learning, and show that by carefully optimizing our systems using the test metrics of the MSCOCO task, significant gains in performance can be realized. Our systems are built using a new optimization approach that we call self-critical sequence training (SCST). SCST is a form of the popular REINFORCE algorithm that, rather than estimating a ""baseline"" to normalize the rewards and reduce variance, utilizes the output of its own test-time inference algorithm to normalize the rewards it experiences. Using this approach, estimating the reward signal (as actor-critic methods must do) and estimating normalization (as REINFORCE algorithms typically do) is avoided, while at the same time harmonizing the model with respect to its test-time inference procedure. Empirically we find that directly optimizing the CIDEr metric with SCST and greedy decoding at test-time is highly effective. Our results on the MSCOCO evaluation sever establish a new state-of-the-art on the task, improving the best result in terms of CIDEr from 104.9 to 112.3.",0
"Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be a powerful framework for learning policies from complex high-dimensional sensory inputs to actions in complex tasks, such as the Atari domain. In this paper, we explore output representation modeling in the form of temporal abstraction to improve convergence and reliability of deep reinforcement learning approaches. We concentrate on macro-actions, and evaluate these on different Atari 2600 games, where we show that they yield significant improvements in learning speed. Additionally, we show that they can even achieve better scores than DQN. We offer analysis and explanation for both convergence and final results, revealing a problem deep RL approaches have with sparse reward signals.",0
"Determination of dietary food consumed a day for patients with diseases in general, greatly affect the health of the body and the healing process, is no exception for people with kidney disease and urinary tract. This paper presents the determination of diet composition in the form of food subtance for people with kidney and urinary tract diseases with a genetic fuzzy approach. This approach combines fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, which utilizing fuzzy logic fuzzy tools and techniques to model the components of the genetic algorithm and adapting genetic algorithm control parameters, with the aim of improving system performance. The Mamdani fuzzy inference model and fuzzy rules based on population parameters and generation are used to determine the probability of crossover and mutation, and was using In this study, 400 food survey data along with their substances was used as test material. From the data, a varying amount of population is established. Each chromosome has 10 genes in which the value of each gene indicates the index number of foodstuffs in the database. The fuzzy genetic approach produces 10 best food substance and their compositions. The composition of these foods has nutritional value in accordance with the number of calories needed by people with kidney and urinary tract diseases by type of food.",0
"We explore the following question: Is a decision-making program fair, for some useful definition of fairness? First, we describe how several algorithmic fairness questions can be phrased as program verification problems. Second, we discuss an automated verification technique for proving or disproving fairness of decision-making programs with respect to a probabilistic model of the population.",0
"Turing test was long considered the measure for artificial intelligence. But with the advances in AI, it has proved to be insufficient measure. We can now aim to mea- sure machine intelligence like we measure human intelligence. One of the widely accepted measure of intelligence is standardized math and science test. In this paper, we explore the progress we have made towards the goal of making a machine smart enough to pass the standardized test. We see the challenges and opportunities posed by the domain, and note that we are quite some ways from actually making a system as smart as a even a middle school scholar.",0
"High dimensional time series are endemic in applications of machine learning such as robotics (sensor data), computational biology (gene expression data), vision (video sequences) and graphics (motion capture data). Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences.",1
"This paper contains the consideration of inheritance mechanism in such knowledge representation models as object-oriented programming, frames and object-oriented dynamic networks. In addition, inheritance within representation of vague and imprecise knowledge are also discussed. New types of inheritance, general classification of all known inheritance types and approach, which allows avoiding in many cases problems with exceptions, redundancy and ambiguity within object-oriented dynamic networks and their fuzzy extension, are introduced in the paper. The proposed approach bases on conception of homogeneous and inhomogeneous or heterogeneous class of objects, which allow building of inheritance hierarchy more flexibly and efficiently.",0
"Reasoning, the most important human brain operation, is charactrized by a degree fuzziness. In the present paper we construct a fuzzy model for the reasoning process giving through the calculation of the possibilities of all possible individuals' profiles a quantitative/qualitative view of their behaviour during the above process and we use the centroid defuzzification technique for measuring the reasoning skills. We also present a number of classroom experiments illustrating our results in practice.",0
"Sensitivity methods for the analysis of the outputs of discrete Bayesian networks have been extensively studied and implemented in different software packages. These methods usually focus on the study of sensitivity functions and on the impact of a parameter change to the Chan-Darwiche distance. Although not fully recognized, the majority of these results heavily rely on the multilinear structure of atomic probabilities in terms of the conditional probability parameters associated with this type of network. By defining a statistical model through the polynomial expression of its associated defining conditional probabilities, we develop a unifying approach to sensitivity methods applicable to a large suite of models including extensions of Bayesian networks, for instance context-specific and dynamic ones, and chain event graphs. By then focusing on models whose defining polynomial is multilinear, our algebraic approach enables us to prove that the Chan-Darwiche distance is minimized for a certain class of multi-parameter contemporaneous variations when parameters are proportionally covaried.",0
"Competing with top human players in the ancient game of Go has been a long-term goal of artificial intelligence. Go's high branching factor makes traditional search techniques ineffective, even on leading-edge hardware, and Go's evaluation function could change drastically with one stone change. Recent works [Maddison et al. (2015); Clark &amp; Storkey (2015)] show that search is not strictly necessary for machine Go players. A pure pattern-matching approach, based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that predicts the next move, can perform as well as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based open source Go engines such as Pachi [Baudis &amp; Gailly (2012)] if its search budget is limited. We extend this idea in our bot named darkforest, which relies on a DCNN designed for long-term predictions. Darkforest substantially improves the win rate for pattern-matching approaches against MCTS-based approaches, even with looser search budgets. Against human players, darkforest achieves a stable 1d-2d level on KGS Go Server, estimated from free games against human players. This substantially improves the estimated rankings reported in Clark &amp; Storkey (2015), where DCNN-based bots are estimated at 4k-5k level based on performance against other machine players. Adding MCTS to darkforest creates a much stronger player: with only 1000 rollouts, darkforest+MCTS beats pure darkforest 90% of the time; with 5000 rollouts, our best model plus MCTS beats Pachi with 10,000 rollouts 95.5% of the time.",1
"Crosslingual word embeddings represent lexical items from different languages in the same vector space, enabling transfer of NLP tools. However, previous attempts had expensive resource requirements, difficulty incorporating monolingual data or were unable to handle polysemy. We address these drawbacks in our method which takes advantage of a high coverage dictionary in an EM style training algorithm over monolingual corpora in two languages. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on bilingual lexicon induction task exceeding models using large bilingual corpora, and competitive results on the monolingual word similarity and cross-lingual document classification task.",1
"An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) should carry out complex tasks in a limited time interval. Since existing AUVs have limited battery capacity and restricted endurance, they should autonomously manage mission time and the resources to perform effective persistent deployment in longer missions. Task assignment requires making decisions subject to resource constraints, while tasks are assigned with costs and/or values that are budgeted in advance. Tasks are distributed in a particular operation zone and mapped by a waypoint covered network. Thus, design an efficient routing-task priority assign framework considering vehicle's availabilities and properties is essential for increasing mission productivity and on-time mission completion. This depends strongly on the order and priority of the tasks that are located between node-like waypoints in an operation network. On the other hand, autonomous operation of AUVs in an unfamiliar dynamic underwater and performing quick response to sudden environmental changes is a complicated process. Water current instabilities can deflect the vehicle to an undesired direction and perturb AUVs safety. The vehicle's robustness to strong environmental variations is extremely crucial for its safe and optimum operations in an uncertain and dynamic environment. To this end, the AUV needs to have a general overview of the environment in top level to perform an autonomous action selection (task selection) and a lower level local motion planner to operate successfully in dealing with continuously changing situations. This research deals with developing a novel reactive control architecture to provide a higher level of decision autonomy for the AUV operation that enables a single vehicle to accomplish multiple tasks in a single mission in the face of periodic disturbances in a turbulent and highly uncertain environment.",0
"The task of computing approximate Nash equilibria in large zero-sum extensive-form games has received a tremendous amount of attention due mainly to the Annual Computer Poker Competition. Immediately after its inception, two competing and seemingly different approaches emerged---one an application of no-regret online learning, the other a sophisticated gradient method applied to a convex-concave saddle-point formulation. Since then, both approaches have grown in relative isolation with advancements on one side not effecting the other. In this paper, we rectify this by dissecting and, in a sense, unify the two views.",0
"Transferring knowledge across a sequence of related tasks is an important challenge in reinforcement learning. Despite much encouraging empirical evidence that shows benefits of transfer, there has been very little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we study a class of lifelong reinforcement-learning problems: the agent solves a sequence of tasks modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), each of which is from a finite set of MDPs with the same state/action spaces and different transition/reward functions. Inspired by the need for cross-task exploration in lifelong learning, we formulate a novel online discovery problem and give an optimal learning algorithm to solve it. Such results allow us to develop a new lifelong reinforcement-learning algorithm, whose overall sample complexity in a sequence of tasks is much smaller than that of single-task learning, with high probability, even if the sequence of tasks is generated by an adversary. Benefits of the algorithm are demonstrated in a simulated problem.",0
"This paper presents a probabilistic model for reasoning about the state of a system as it changes over time, both due to exogenous and endogenous influences. Our target domain is a class of medical prediction problems that are neither so urgent as to preclude careful diagnosis nor progress so slowly as to allow arbitrary testing and treatment options. In these domains there is typically enough time to gather information about the patient's state and consider alternative diagnoses and treatments, but the temporal interaction between the timing of tests, treatments, and the course of the disease must also be considered. Our approach is to elicit a qualitative structural model of the patient from a human expert---the model identifies important attributes, the way in which exogenous changes affect attribute values, and the way in which the patient's condition changes endogenously. We then elicit probabilistic information to capture the expert's uncertainty about the effects of tests and treatments and the nature and timing of endogenous state changes. This paper describes the model in the context of a problem in treating vehicle accident trauma, and suggests a method for solving the model based on the technique of sequential imputation. A complementary goal of this work is to understand and synthesize a disparate collection of research efforts all using the name ?probabilistic temporal reasoning.? This paper analyzes related work and points out essential differences between our proposed model and other approaches in the literature.",0
"The assignment of tasks to multiple resources becomes an interesting game theoretic problem, when both the task owner and the resources are strategic. In the classical, nonstrategic setting, where the states of the tasks and resources are observable by the controller, this problem is that of finding an optimal policy for a Markov decision process (MDP). When the states are held by strategic agents, the problem of an efficient task allocation extends beyond that of solving an MDP and becomes that of designing a mechanism. Motivated by this fact, we propose a general mechanism which decides on an allocation rule for the tasks and resources and a payment rule to incentivize agents' participation and truthful reports. In contrast to related dynamic strategic control problems studied in recent literature, the problem studied here has interdependent values: the benefit of an allocation to the task owner is not simply a function of the characteristics of the task itself and the allocation, but also of the state of the resources. We introduce a dynamic extension of Mezzetti's two phase mechanism for interdependent valuations. In this changed setting, the proposed dynamic mechanism is efficient, within period ex-post incentive compatible, and within period ex-post individually rational.",0
"Security Games employ game theoretical tools to derive resource allocation strategies in security domains. Recent works considered the presence of alarm systems, even suffering various forms of uncertainty, and showed that disregarding alarm signals may lead to arbitrarily bad strategies. The central problem with an alarm system, unexplored in other Security Games, is finding the best strategy to respond to alarm signals for each mobile defensive resource. The literature provides results for the basic single-resource case, showing that even in that case the problem is computationally hard. In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of designing algorithms scaling with multiple resources. First, we focus on finding the minimum number of resources assuring non-null protection to every target. Then, we deal with the computation of multi-resource strategies with different degrees of coordination among resources. For each considered problem, we provide a computational analysis and propose algorithmic methods.",0
"Methods of deep machine learning enable to to reuse low-level representations efficiently for generating more abstract high-level representations. Originally, deep learning has been applied passively (e.g., for classification purposes). Recently, it has been extended to estimate the value of actions for autonomous agents within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Explicit models of the environment can be learned to augment such a value function. Although ""flat"" connectionist methods have already been used for model-based RL, up to now, only model-free variants of RL have been equipped with methods from deep learning. We propose a variant of deep model-based RL that enables an agent to learn arbitrarily abstract hierarchical representations of its environment. In this paper, we present research on how such hierarchical representations can be grounded in sensorimotor interaction between an agent and its environment.",0
"Decision-making problems in uncertain or stochastic domains are often formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Policy iteration (PI) is a popular algorithm for searching over policy-space, the size of which is exponential in the number of states. We are interested in bounds on the complexity of PI that do not depend on the value of the discount factor. In this paper we prove the first such non-trivial, worst-case, upper bounds on the number of iterations required by PI to converge to the optimal policy. Our analysis also sheds new light on the manner in which PI progresses through the space of policies.",0
"A new emerging paradigm of Uncertain Risk of Suspicion, Threat and Danger, observed across the field of information security, is described. Based on this paradigm a novel approach to anomaly detection is presented. Our approach is based on a simple yet powerful analogy from the innate part of the human immune system, the Toll-Like Receptors. We argue that such receptors incorporated as part of an anomaly detector enhance the detector's ability to distinguish normal and anomalous behaviour. In addition we propose that Toll-Like Receptors enable the classification of detected anomalies based on the types of attacks that perpetrate the anomalous behaviour. Classification of such type is either missing in existing literature or is not fit for the purpose of reducing the burden of an administrator of an intrusion detection system. For our model to work, we propose the creation of a taxonomy of the digital Acytota, based on which our receptors are created.",0
"Logic programs with aggregates (LPA) are one of the major linguistic extensions to Logic Programming (LP). In this work, we propose a generalization of the notions of unfounded set and well-founded semantics for programs with monotone and antimonotone aggregates (LPAma programs). In particular, we present a new notion of unfounded set for LPAma programs, which is a sound generalization of the original definition for standard (aggregate-free) LP. On this basis, we define a well-founded operator for LPAma programs, the fixpoint of which is called well-founded model (or well-founded semantics) for LPAma programs. The most important properties of unfounded sets and the well-founded semantics for standard LP are retained by this generalization, notably existence and uniqueness of the well-founded model, together with a strong relationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one of the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for a broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the well-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss some complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable computation of the well-founded model for LPA programs. Moreover, we prove that for general LPA programs, which may contain aggregates that are neither monotone nor antimonotone, deciding satisfaction of aggregate expressions with respect to partial interpretations is coNP-complete. As a consequence, a well-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable computation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma programs. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports the well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only implemented system that does so. Experiments with this prototype show significant computational advantages of aggregate constructs over equivalent aggregate-free encodings.",0
"Survey propagation (SP) is an exciting new technique that has been remarkably successful at solving very large hard combinatorial problems, such as determining the satisfiability of Boolean formulas. In a promising attempt at understanding the success of SP, it was recently shown that SP can be viewed as a form of belief propagation, computing marginal probabilities over certain objects called covers of a formula. This explanation was, however, shortly dismissed by experiments suggesting that non-trivial covers simply do not exist for large formulas. In this paper, we show that these experiments were misleading: not only do covers exist for large hard random formulas, SP is surprisingly accurate at computing marginals over these covers despite the existence of many cycles in the formulas. This re-opens a potentially simpler line of reasoning for understanding SP, in contrast to some alternative lines of explanation that have been proposed assuming covers do not exist.",0
"This work introduces a probabilistic-based model for binary CSP that provides a fine grained analysis of its internal structure. Assuming that a domain modification could occur in the CSP, it shows how to express, in a predictive way, the probability that a domain value becomes inconsistent, then it express the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values in each domain of the constraint network. Thus, it express the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values for the whole constraint network. Next, it provides bounds for each of these three probabilistic indicators. Finally, a polytime algorithm, which propagates the probabilistic information, is presented.",0
"Knowledge is only good if it is sound, consistent and complete. The same holds true for conceptual knowledge, which holds knowledge about concepts and its association. Conceptual knowledge no matter what format they are represented in, must be consistent, sound and complete in order to realise its practical use. This paper discusses consistency, soundness and completeness in the ambit of conceptual knowledge and the need to consider these factors as fundamental to the development of conceptual knowledge.",0
"The purpose of this study is to provide an accessibility measure of web-pages, in order to draw disabled users to the pages that have been designed to be ac-cessible to them. Our approach is based on the theory of belief functions, using data which are supplied by reports produced by automatic web content assessors that test the validity of criteria defined by the WCAG 2.0 guidelines proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) organization. These tools detect errors with gradual degrees of certainty and their results do not always converge. For these reasons, to fuse information coming from the reports, we choose to use an information fusion framework which can take into account the uncertainty and imprecision of infor-mation as well as divergences between sources. Our accessibility indicator covers four categories of deficiencies. To validate the theoretical approach in this context, we propose an evaluation completed on a corpus of 100 most visited French news websites, and 2 evaluation tools. The results obtained illustrate the interest of our accessibility indicator.",0
"The theory of belief functions manages uncertainty and also proposes a set of combination rules to aggregate opinions of several sources. Some combination rules mix evidential information where sources are independent; other rules are suited to combine evidential information held by dependent sources. In this paper we have two main contributions: First we suggest a method to quantify sources' degree of independence that may guide the choice of the more appropriate set of combination rules. Second, we propose a new combination rule that takes consideration of sources' degree of independence. The proposed method is illustrated on generated mass functions.",0
"In this article, we introduce a new conception of a family of esport games called Samu Entropy to try to improve dataflow program graphs like the ones that are based on Google's TensorFlow. Currently, the Samu Entropy project specifies only requirements for new esport games to be developed with particular attention to the investigation of the relationship between esport and artificial intelligence. It is quite obvious that there is a very close and natural relationship between esport games and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the project Samu Entropy focuses not only on using artificial intelligence, but on creating AI in a new way. We present a reference game called Face Battle that implements the Samu Entropy requirements.",0
"In the literature, two series of models have been proposed to address prediction problems including classification and regression.

The other series, including tree-based models, organize numerical, categorical and high dimensional features into a comprehensive structure with rich interpretable information in the data.",0
"Machine Learner for Automated Reasoning (MaLARea) is a learning and reasoning system for proving in large formal libraries where thousands of theorems are available when attacking a new conjecture, and a large number of related problems and proofs can be used to learn specific theorem-proving knowledge. The last version of the system has by a large margin won the 2013 CASC LTB competition. This paper describes the motivation behind the methods used in MaLARea, discusses the general approach and the issues arising in evaluation of such system, and describes the Mizar@Turing100 and CASC'24 versions of MaLARea.",0
"In recent years, Answer Set Programming (ASP), logic programming under the stable model or answer set semantics, has seen several extensions by generalizing the notion of an atom in these programs: be it aggregate atoms, HEX atoms, generalized quantifiers, or abstract constraints, the idea is to have more complicated satisfaction patterns in the lattice of Herbrand interpretations than traditional, simple atoms. In this paper we refer to any of these constructs as generalized atoms. Several semantics with differing characteristics have been proposed for these extensions, rendering the big picture somewhat blurry. In this paper, we analyze the class of programs that have convex generalized atoms (originally proposed by Liu and Truszczynski in [10]) in rule bodies and show that for this class many of the proposed semantics coincide. This is an interesting result, since recently it has been shown that this class is the precise complexity boundary for the FLP semantics. We investigate whether similar results also hold for other semantics, and discuss the implications of our findings.",0
"We present a first theoretical analysis of the power of polynomial-time preprocessing for important combinatorial problems from various areas in AI. We consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints, Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning under structural restrictions. All these problems involve two tasks: (i) identifying the structure in the input as required by the restriction, and (ii) using the identified structure to solve the reasoning task efficiently. We show that for most of the considered problems, task (i) admits a polynomial-time preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural problem parameter of the input, in contrast to task (ii) which does not admit such a reduction to a problem kernel of polynomial size, subject to a complexity theoretic assumption. As a notable exception we show that the consistency problem for the AtMost-NValue constraint admits a polynomial kernel consisting of a quadratic number of variables and domain values. Our results provide a firm worst-case guarantees and theoretical boundaries for the performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered problems.",0
"The Next Generation Air Transportation System will introduce new, advanced sensor technologies into the cockpit. With the introduction of such systems, the responsibilities of the pilot are expected to dramatically increase. In the ALARMS (ALerting And Reasoning Management System) project for NASA, we focus on a key challenge of this environment, the quick and efficient handling of aircraft sensor alerts. It is infeasible to alert the pilot on the state of all subsystems at all times. Furthermore, there is uncertainty as to the true hazard state despite the evidence of the alerts, and there is uncertainty as to the effect and duration of actions taken to address these alerts. This paper reports on the first steps in the construction of an application designed to handle Next Generation alerts. In ALARMS, we have identified 60 different aircraft subsystems and 20 different underlying hazards. In this paper, we show how a Bayesian network can be used to derive the state of the underlying hazards, based on the sensor input. Then, we propose a framework whereby an automated system can plan to address these hazards in cooperation with the pilot, using a Time-Dependent Markov Process (TMDP). Different hazards and pilot states will call for different alerting automation plans. We demonstrate this emerging application of Bayesian networks and TMDPs to cockpit automation, for a use case where a small number of hazards are present, and analyze the resulting alerting automation policies.",0
"Many real-world problems are composed of several interacting components. In order to facilitate research on such interactions, the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) was created in 2013 as the combination of two well-understood combinatorial optimization problems.",0
"In this paper, we present algorithms that perform gradient ascent of the average reward in a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). These algorithms are based on GPOMDP, an algorithm introduced in a companion paper (Baxter and Bartlett, this volume), which computes biased estimates of the performance gradient in POMDPs. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it uses only one free parameter beta, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, it requires no knowledge of the underlying state, and it can be applied to infinite state, control and observation spaces. We show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used to perform gradient ascent, both with a traditional stochastic-gradient algorithm, and with an algorithm based on conjugate-gradients that utilizes gradient information to bracket maxima in line searches. Experimental results are presented illustrating both the theoretical results of (Baxter and Bartlett, this volume) on a toy problem, and practical aspects of the algorithms on a number of more realistic problems.",0
"This paper presents a structured power and energy-flow-based qualitative modelling approach that is applicable to a variety of system types including electrical and fluid flow. The modelling is split into two parts. Power flow is a global phenomenon and is therefore naturally represented and analysed by a network comprised of the relevant structural elements from the components of a system. The power flow analysis is a platform for higher-level behaviour prediction of energy related aspects using local component behaviour models to capture a state-based representation with a global time. The primary application is Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and a form of exaggeration reasoning is used, combined with an order of magnitude representation to derive the worst case failure modes. The novel aspects of the work are an order of magnitude(OM) qualitative network analyser to represent any power domain and topology, including multiple power sources, a feature that was not required for earlier specialised electrical versions of the approach. Secondly, the representation of generalised energy related behaviour as state-based local models is presented as a modelling strategy that can be more vivid and intuitive for a range of topologically complex applications than qualitative equation-based representations.The two-level modelling strategy allows the broad system behaviour coverage of qualitative simulation to be exploited for the FMEA task, while limiting the difficulties of qualitative ambiguity explanation that can arise from abstracted numerical models. We have used the method to support an automated FMEA system with examples of an aircraft fuel system and domestic a heating system discussed in this paper.",0
"We present ULSA, a novel stochastic local search algorithm for random binary constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). ULSA is many times faster than the prior state of the art on a widely-studied suite of random CSP benchmarks. Unlike the best previous methods for these benchmarks, ULSA is a simple unweighted method that does not require dynamic adaptation of weights or penalties. ULSA obtains new record best solutions satisfying 99 of 100 variables in the challenging frb100-40 benchmark instance.",0
"We show how to find a small loop curser in a Bayesian network. Finding such a loop cutset is the first step in the method of conditioning for inference. Our algorithm for finding a loop cutset, called MGA, finds a loop cutset which is guaranteed in the worst case to contain less than twice the number of variables contained in a minimum loop cutset. We test MGA on randomly generated graphs and find that the average ratio between the number of instances associated with the algorithms' output and the number of instances associated with a minimum solution is 1.22.",0
"We present probabilistic logic programming under inheritance with overriding. This approach is based on new notions of entailment for reasoning with conditional constraints, which are obtained from the classical notion of logical entailment by adding the principle of inheritance with overriding. This is done by using recent approaches to probabilistic default reasoning with conditional constraints. We analyze the semantic properties of the new entailment relations. We also present algorithms for probabilistic logic programming under inheritance with overriding, and program transformations for an increased efficiency.",0
"The art of solving the Mastermind puzzle was initiated by Donald Knuth and is already more than 30 years old; despite that, it still receives much attention in operational research and computer games journals, not to mention the nature-inspired stochastic algorithm literature. In this paper we try to suggest a strategy that will allow nature-inspired algorithms to obtain results as good as those based on exhaustive search strategies; in order to do that, we first review, compare and improve current approaches to solving the puzzle; then we test one of these strategies with an estimation of distribution algorithm. Finally, we try to find a strategy that falls short of being exhaustive, and is then amenable for inclusion in nature inspired algorithms (such as evolutionary or particle swarm algorithms). This paper proves that by the incorporation of local entropy into the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm it becomes a better player than a random one, and gives a rule of thumb on how to incorporate the best heuristic strategies to evolutionary algorithms without incurring in an excessive computational cost.",0
Qsmodels is a novel application of Answer Set Programming to interactive gaming environment. We describe a software architecture by which the behavior of a bot acting inside the Quake 3 Arena can be controlled by a planner. The planner is written as an Answer Set Program and is interpreted by the Smodels solver.,0
"We consider the problem of learning the canonical parameters specifying an undirected graphical model (Markov random field) from the mean parameters. For graphical models representing a minimal exponential family, the canonical parameters are uniquely determined by the mean parameters, so the problem is feasible in principle. The goal of this paper is to investigate the computational feasibility of this statistical task. Our main result shows that parameter estimation is in general intractable: no algorithm can learn the canonical parameters of a generic pair-wise binary graphical model from the mean parameters in time bounded by a polynomial in the number of variables (unless RP = NP). Indeed, such a result has been believed to be true (see the monograph by Wainwright and Jordan (2008)) but no proof was known.",1
"It is used daily by millions of people to communicate around the globe and is a mission-critical application for many businesses. Over the last decade, unsolicited bulk email has become a major problem for email users. An overwhelming amount of spam is flowing into users' mailboxes daily. In 2004, an estimated 62% of all email was attributed to spam. Not only is spam frustrating for most email users, it strains the IT infrastructure of organizations and costs businesses billions of dollars in lost productivity. In recent years, spam has evolved from an annoyance into a serious security threat, and is now a prime medium for phishing of sensitive information, as well the spread of malicious software. Therefore we propose an algorithm that uses a classifier as one of its components. Our proposal does not include the development of a classifier itself, instead of that it plans an adjustment in the classifier training set data in order to improve their performance.",0
"For product rating environments, similar to that of Amazon Reviews, it has been shown that the truthful elicitation of feedback is possible through mechanisms which pay buyer reports contingent on the reports of other buyers. We study whether similar mechanisms can be designed for reputation mechanisms at online auction sites where the buyers' experiences are partially determined by a strategic seller. We show that this is impossible for the basic setting. However, introducing a small prior belief that the seller is a cooperative commitment player leads to a payment scheme with a truthful perfect Bayesian equilibrium.",0
"Web Usage Mining is the application of data mining techniques to web usage log repositories in order to discover the usage patterns that can be used to analyze the users navigational behavior. During the preprocessing stage, raw web log data is transformed into a set of user profiles. Each user profile captures a set of URLs representing a user session. Clustering can be applied to this sessionized data in order to capture similar interests and trends among users navigational patterns. Since the sessionized data may contain thousands of user sessions and each user session may consist of hundreds of URL accesses, dimensionality reduction is achieved by eliminating the low support URLs. Very small sessions are also removed in order to filter out the noise from the data. But direct elimination of low support URLs and small sized sessions may results in loss of a significant amount of information especially when the count of low support URLs and small sessions is large. We propose a fuzzy solution to deal with this problem by assigning weights to URLs and user sessions based on a fuzzy membership function. After assigning the weights we apply a Fuzzy c-Mean Clustering algorithm to discover the clusters of user profiles. In this paper, we describe our fuzzy set theoretic approach to perform feature selection (or dimensionality reduction) and session weight assignment. Finally we compare our soft computing based approach of dimensionality reduction with the traditional approach of direct elimination of small sessions and low support count URLs. Our results show that fuzzy feature evaluation and dimensionality reduction results in better performance and validity indices for the discovered clusters.",0
"In this paper, firstly we present Maji's definitions \cite{maji-2013} and verify that that some propositions are incorrect by a counterexample. We then redefine concept of neutrosophic soft set and their operation based on \c{C}a\u{g}man \cite{cagman-2014} and investigate some properties of these operations. We then construct an decision making method and group decision making which selects an optimum element from the alternatives by using weights of parameters. We finally present an example which shows that the method can be successfully applied to many problems that contain uncertainties",0
"Recent developments show that Multiply Sectioned Bayesian Networks (MSBNs) can be used for diagnosis of natural systems as well as for model-based diagnosis of artificial systems. They can be applied to single-agent oriented reasoning systems as well as multi-agent distributed probabilistic reasoning systems. Belief propagation between a pair of subnets plays a central role in maintenance of global consistency in a MSBN. This paper studies the operation UpdateBelief, presented originally with MSBNs, for inter-subnet propagation. We analyze how the operation achieves its intended functionality, which provides hints as for how its efficiency can be improved. We then define two new versions of UpdateBelief that reduce the computation time for inter-subnet propagation. One of them is optimal in the sense that the minimum amount of computation for coordinating multi-linkage belief propagation is required. The optimization problem is solved through the solution of a graph-theoretic problem: the minimum weight open tour in a tree.",0
"Because an agents resources dictate what actions it can possibly take, it should plan which resources it holds over time carefully, considering its inherent limitations (such as power or payload restrictions), the competing needs of other agents for the same resources, and the stochastic nature of the environment. Such agents can, in general, achieve more of their objectives if they can use --- and even create --- opportunities to change which resources they hold at various times. Driven by resource constraints, the agents could break their overall missions into an optimal series of phases, optimally reconfiguring their resources at each phase, and optimally using their assigned resources in each phase, given their knowledge of the stochastic environment. In this paper, we formally define and analyze this constrained, sequential optimization problem in both the single-agent and multi-agent contexts. We present a family of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations of this problem that can optimally create phases (when phases are not predefined) accounting for costs and limitations in phase creation. Because our formulations multaneously also find the optimal allocations of resources at each phase and the optimal policies for using the allocated resources at each phase, they exploit structure across these coupled problems. This allows them to find solutions significantly faster(orders of magnitude faster in larger problems) than alternative solution techniques, as we demonstrate empirically.",0
"Previous research into the relation between ASP and classical logic has identified at least two different ways in which the former extends the latter. First, ASP program typically contain sets of rules that can be naturally interpreted as inductive definitions, and the language FO(ID) has shown that such inductive definitions can elegantly be added to classical logic in a modular way. Second, there is of course also the well-known epistemic component of ASP, which was mainly emphasized in the early papers on stable model semantics. To investigate whether this kind of knowledge can also, and in a similarly modular way, be added to classical logic, the language of Ordered Epistemic Logic was presented in recent work. However, this logic views the epistemic component as entirely separate from the inductive definition component, thus ignoring any possible interplay between the two. In this paper, we present a language that extends the inductive definition construct found in FO(ID) with an epistemic component, making such interplay possible. The eventual goal of this work is to discover whether it is really appropriate to view the epistemic component and the inductive definition component of ASP as two separate extensions of classical logic, or whether there is also something of importance in the combination of the two.",0
This paper presents a Directed Controller Synthesis (DCS) technique for discrete event systems. The DCS method explores the solution space for reactive controllers guided by a domain-independent heuristic. The heuristic is derived from an efficient abstraction of the environment based on the componentized way in which complex environments are described. Then by building the composition of the components on-the-fly DCS obtains a solution by exploring a reduced portion of the state space. This work focuses on untimed discrete event systems with safety and co-safety (i.e. reachability) goals. An evaluation for the technique is presented comparing it to other well-known approaches to controller synthesis (based on symbolic representation and compositional analyses).,0
"While several matrix factorization (MF) and tensor factorization (TF) models have been proposed for knowledge base (KB) inference, they have rarely been compared across various datasets. Is there a single model that performs well across datasets? If not, what characteristics of a dataset determine the performance of MF and TF models? Is there a joint TF+MF model that performs robustly on all datasets? We perform an extensive evaluation to compare popular KB inference models across popular datasets in the literature. In addition to answering the questions above, we remove a limitation in the standard evaluation protocol for MF models, propose an extension to MF models so that they can better handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) entity pairs, and develop a novel combination of TF and MF models. We also analyze and explain the results based on models and dataset characteristics. Our best model is robust, and obtains strong results across all datasets.",0
"In many robotic applications, some aspects of the system dynamics can be modeled accurately while others are difficult to obtain or model. We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for continuous state and action spaces that learns with partial knowledge of the system and without active exploration. It solves linearly-solvable Markov decision processes (L-MDPs), which are well suited for continuous state and action spaces, based on an actor-critic architecture. Compared to previous RL methods for L-MDPs and path integral methods which are model based, the actor-critic learning does not need a model of the uncontrolled dynamics and, importantly, transition noise levels; however, it requires knowing the control dynamics for the problem. We evaluate our method on two synthetic test problems, and one real-world problem in simulation and using real traffic data. Our experiments demonstrate improved learning and policy performance.",0
"Fuzzy systems concern fundamental methodology to represent and process uncertainty and imprecision in the linguistic information. The fuzzy systems that use fuzzy rules to represent the domain knowledge of the problem are known as Fuzzy Rule Base Systems (FRBS). On the other hand image segmentation and subsequent extraction from a noise-affected background, with the help of various soft computing methods, are relatively new and quite popular due to various reasons. These methods include various Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models (primarily supervised in nature), Genetic Algorithm (GA) based techniques, intensity histogram based methods etc. providing an extraction solution working in unsupervised mode happens to be even more interesting problem. Literature suggests that effort in this respect appears to be quite rudimentary. In the present article, we propose a fuzzy rule guided novel technique that is functional devoid of any external intervention during execution. Experimental results suggest that this approach is an efficient one in comparison to different other techniques extensively addressed in literature. In order to justify the supremacy of performance of our proposed technique in respect of its competitors, we take recourse to effective metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).",0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general paradigm for studying intelligent behaviour, with applications ranging from artificial intelligence to psychology and economics. AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn any computable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is that it is defined using a mixture over semimeasures that need not sum to 1, rather than over proper probability measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's estimate of the probability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent agents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour. Notable discoveries include that agent behaviour can change radically under positive linear transformations of the reward signal (from suicidal to dogmatically self-preserving), and that the agent's posterior belief that it will survive increases over time.",0
"We present ShapeNet: a richly-annotated, large-scale repository of shapes represented by 3D CAD models of objects. ShapeNet contains 3D models from a multitude of semantic categories and organizes them under the WordNet taxonomy. It is a collection of datasets providing many semantic annotations for each 3D model such as consistent rigid alignments, parts and bilateral symmetry planes, physical sizes, keywords, as well as other planned annotations. Annotations are made available through a public web-based interface to enable data visualization of object attributes, promote data-driven geometric analysis, and provide a large-scale quantitative benchmark for research in computer graphics and vision. At the time of this technical report, ShapeNet has indexed more than 3,000,000 models, 220,000 models out of which are classified into 3,135 categories (WordNet synsets). In this report we describe the ShapeNet effort as a whole, provide details for all currently available datasets, and summarize future plans.",0

"This study explores the design and control of the behaviour of agents and robots using simple circuits of spiking neurons and Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) as a mechanism of associative and unsupervised learning. Based on a ""reward and punishment"" classical conditioning, it is demonstrated that these robots learnt to identify and avoid obstacles as well as to identify and look for rewarding stimuli. Using the simulation and programming environment NetLogo, a software engine for the Integrate and Fire model was developed, which allowed us to monitor in discrete time steps the dynamics of each single neuron, synapse and spike in the proposed neural networks. These spiking neural networks (SNN) served as simple brains for the experimental robots. The Lego Mindstorms robot kit was used for the embodiment of the simulated agents. In this paper the topological building blocks are presented as well as the neural parameters required to reproduce the experiments. This paper summarizes the resulting behaviour as well as the observed dynamics of the neural circuits. The Internet-link to the NetLogo code is included in the annex.",0
"The quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem arises in diverse optimization applications ranging from Ising spin problems to classical problems in graph theory and binary discrete optimization. The use of preprocessing to transform the graph representing the QUBO problem into a smaller equivalent graph is important for improving solution quality and time for both exact and metaheuristic algorithms and is a step towards mapping large scale QUBO to hardware graphs used in quantum annealing computers. In an earlier paper (Lewis and Glover, 2016) a set of rules was introduced that achieved significant QUBO reductions as verified through computational testing. Here this work is extended with additional rules that provide further reductions that succeed in exactly solving 10% of the benchmark QUBO problems. An algorithm and associated data structures to efficiently implement the entire set of rules is detailed and computational experiments are reported that demonstrate their efficacy.",0
"We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation allows changing the agent's goal at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.",1
"Outlier detection in a large-scale database is a significant and complex issue in knowledge discovering field. As the data distributions are obscure and uncertain in high dimensional space, most existing solutions try to solve the issue taking into account the two intuitive points: first, outliers are extremely far away from other points in high dimensional space; second, outliers are detected obviously different in projected-dimensional subspaces. However, for a complicated case that outliers are hidden inside the normal points in all dimensions, existing detection methods fail to find such inner outliers. In this paper, we propose a method with twice dimension-projections, which integrates primary subspace outlier detection and secondary point-projection between subspaces, and sums up the multiple weight values for each point. The points are computed with local density ratio separately in twice-projected dimensions. After the process, outliers are those points scoring the largest values of weight. The proposed method succeeds to find all inner outliers on the synthetic test datasets with the dimension varying from 100 to 10000. The experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm can work in low dimensional space and can achieve perfect performance in high dimensional space. As for this reason, our proposed approach has considerable potential to apply it in multimedia applications helping to process images or video with large-scale attributes.",0
"This paper presents a statistical method for music transcription that can estimate score times of note onsets and offsets from polyphonic MIDI performance signals. Because performed note durations can deviate largely from score-indicated values, previous methods had the problem of not being able to accurately estimate offset score times (or note values) and thus could only output incomplete musical scores. Based on observations that the pitch context and onset score times are influential on the configuration of note values, we construct a context-tree model that provides prior distributions of note values using these features and combine it with a performance model in the framework of Markov random fields. Evaluation results showed that our method reduces the average error rate by around 40 percent compared to existing/simple methods. We also confirmed that, in our model, the score model plays a more important role than the performance model, and it automatically captures the voice structure by unsupervised learning.",0
"We investigate the application of classification techniques to utility elicitation. In a decision problem, two sets of parameters must generally be elicited: the probabilities and the utilities. While the prior and conditional probabilities in the model do not change from user to user, the utility models do. Thus it is necessary to elicit a utility model separately for each new user. Elicitation is long and tedious, particularly if the outcome space is large and not decomposable. There are two common approaches to utility function elicitation. The first is to base the determination of the users utility function solely ON elicitation OF qualitative preferences.The second makes assumptions about the form AND decomposability OF the utility function.Here we take a different approach: we attempt TO identify the new USERs utility function based on classification relative to a database of previously collected utility functions. We do this by identifying clusters of utility functions that minimize an appropriate distance measure. Having identified the clusters, we develop a classification scheme that requires many fewer and simpler assessments than full utility elicitation and is more robust than utility elicitation based solely on preferences. We have tested our algorithm on a small database of utility functions in a prenatal diagnosis domain and the results are quite promising.",0
"Entity resolution (ER) is about identifying and merging records in a database that represent the same real-world entity. Matching dependencies (MDs) have been introduced and investigated as declarative rules that specify ER policies. An ER process induced by MDs over a dirty instance leads to multiple clean instances, in general. General ""answer sets programs"" have been proposed to specify the MD-based cleaning task and its results. In this work, we extend MDs to ""relational MDs"", which capture more application semantics, and identify classes of relational MDs for which the general ASP can be automatically rewritten into a stratified Datalog program, with the single clean instance as its standard model.",0
We review the problem of time-critical action and discuss a reformulation that shifts knowledge acquisition from the assessment of complex temporal probabilistic dependencies to the direct assessment of time-dependent utilities over key outcomes of interest. We dwell on a class of decision problems characterized by the centrality of diagnosing and reacting in a timely manner to pathological processes. We motivate key ideas in the context of trauma-care triage and transportation decisions.,0
"Markov logic uses weighted formulas to compactly encode a probability distribution over possible worlds. Despite the use of logical formulas, Markov logic networks (MLNs) can be difficult to interpret, due to the often counter-intuitive meaning of their weights. To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a possibilistic logic theory that exactly captures what can be derived from a given MLN using maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Unfortunately, the size of this theory is exponential in general. We therefore also propose two methods which can derive compact theories that still capture MAP inference, but only for specific types of evidence. These theories can be used, among others, to make explicit the hidden assumptions underlying an MLN or to explain the predictions it makes.",0
"The fundamental laws of quantum world upsets the logical foundation of classic physics. They are completely counter-intuitive with many bizarre behaviors. However, this paper shows that they may make sense from the perspective of a general decision-optimization principle for cooperation. This principle also offers a generalization of Nash equilibrium, a key concept in game theory, for better payoffs and stability of game playing.",0
"We present a new approach to path planning, called the ""Ariadne's clew algorithm"". It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments - ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called Search and Explore, applied in an interleaved manner. Explore builds a representation of the accessible space while Search looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is found in about one second without any pre-processing.",0
"In this survey we present different approaches that allow an intelligent agent to explore autonomous its environment to gather information and learn multiple tasks. Different communities proposed different solutions, that are in many cases, similar and/or complementary. These solutions include active learning, exploration/exploitation, online-learning and social learning. The common aspect of all these approaches is that it is the agent to selects and decides what information to gather next. Applications for these approaches already include tutoring systems, autonomous grasping learning, navigation and mapping and human-robot interaction. We discuss how these approaches are related, explaining their similarities and their differences in terms of problem assumptions and metrics of success. We consider that such an integrated discussion will improve inter-disciplinary research and applications.",0
"Logical inference algorithms for conditional independence (CI) statements have important applications from testing consistency during knowledge elicitation to constraintbased structure learning of graphical models. We prove that the implication problem for CI statements is decidable, given that the size of the domains of the random variables is known and fixed. We will present an approximate logical inference algorithm which combines a falsification and a novel validation algorithm. The validation algorithm represents each set of CI statements as a sparse 0-1 matrix A and validates instances of the implication problem by solving specific linear programs with constraint matrix A. We will show experimentally that the algorithm is both effective and efficient in validating and falsifying instances of the probabilistic CI implication problem.",0
"Despite outstanding success in vision amongst other domains, many of the recent deep learning approaches have evident drawbacks for robots. This manuscript surveys recent work in the literature that pertain to applying deep learning systems to the robotics domain, either as means of estimation or as a tool to resolve motor commands directly from raw percepts. These recent advances are only a piece to the puzzle. We suggest that deep learning as a tool alone is insufficient in building a unified framework to acquire general intelligence. For this reason, we complement our survey with insights from cognitive development and refer to ideas from classical control theory, producing an integrated direction for a lifelong learning architecture.",0
"Catastrophic forgetting has a serious impact in reinforcement learning, as the data distribution is generally sparse and non-stationary over time. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pseudorehearsal can increase performance of an actor-critic agent with neural-network based policy selection and function approximation in a pole balancing task and compare different pseudorehearsal approaches. We expect that pseudorehearsal assists learning even in such very simple problems, given proper initialization of the rehearsal parameters.",0
"Today, with respect to the increasing growth of demand to get credit from the customers of banks and finance and credit institutions, using an effective and efficient method to decrease the risk of non-repayment of credit given is very necessary. Assessment of customers' credit is one of the most important and the most essential duties of banks and institutions, and if an error occurs in this field, it would leads to the great losses for banks and institutions. Thus, using the predicting computer systems has been significantly progressed in recent decades. The data that are provided to the credit institutions' managers help them to make a straight decision for giving the credit or not-giving it. In this paper, we will assess the customer credit through a combined classification using artificial neural networks, genetics algorithm and Bayesian probabilities simultaneously, and the results obtained from three methods mentioned above would be used to achieve an appropriate and final result. We use the K_folds cross validation test in order to assess the method and finally, we compare the proposed method with the methods such as Clustering-Launched Classification (CLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) as well as GA+SVM where the genetics algorithm has been used to improve them.",0
"Input languages of answer set solvers are based on the mathematically simple concept of a stable model. But many useful constructs available in these languages, including local variables, conditional literals, and aggregates, cannot be easily explained in terms of stable models in the sense of the original definition of this concept and its straightforward generalizations. Manuals written by designers of answer set solvers usually explain such constructs using examples and informal comments that appeal to the user's intuition, without references to any precise semantics. We propose to approach the problem of defining the semantics of gringo programs by translating them into the language of infinitary propositional formulas. This semantics allows us to study equivalent transformations of gringo programs using natural deduction in infinitary propositional logic.",0
"Games have always been popular testbeds for Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the last decade, we have seen the rise of the Multiple Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, which are the most played games nowadays. In spite of this, there are few works that explore MOBA as a testbed for AI Research. In this paper we present and discuss the main features and opportunities offered by MOBA games to Game AI Research. We describe the various challenges faced along the game and also propose a discrete model that can be used to better understand and explore the game. With this, we aim to encourage the use of MOBA as a novel research platform for Game AI.",0
"Knowledge base completion aims to infer new relations from existing information. In this paper, we propose path-augmented TransR (PTransR) model to improve the accuracy of link prediction. In our approach, we base PTransR model on TransR, which is the best one-hop model at present. Then we regularize TransR with information of relation paths. In our experiment, we evaluate PTransR on the task of entity prediction. Experimental results show that PTransR outperforms previous models.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP). For complex, high-dimensional MDPs, it may only be feasible to represent the policy with function approximation. If the policy representation used cannot represent good policies, the problem is misspecified and the learned policy may be far from optimal. We introduce IHOMP as an approach for solving misspecified problems. IHOMP iteratively refines a set of specialized policies based on a limited representation. We refer to these policies as policy threads. At the same time, IHOMP stitches these policy threads together in a hierarchical fashion to solve a problem that was otherwise misspecified. We prove that IHOMP enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees and extend IHOMP to exploit Option Interruption (OI) enabling it to learn where policy threads can be reused. Our experiments demonstrate that IHOMP can find near-optimal solutions to otherwise misspecified problems and that OI can further improve the solutions.",0
"We are developing a general framework for using learned Bayesian models for decision-theoretic control of search and reasoningalgorithms. We illustrate the approach on the specific task of controlling both general and domain-specific solvers on a hard class of structured constraint satisfaction problems. A successful strategyfor reducing the high (and even infinite) variance in running time typically exhibited by backtracking search algorithms is to cut off and restart the search if a solution is not found within a certainamount of time. Previous work on restart strategies have employed fixed cut off values. We show how to create a dynamic cut off strategy by learning a Bayesian model that predicts the ultimate length of a trial based on observing the early behavior of the search algorithm. Furthermore, we describe the general conditions under which a dynamic restart strategy can outperform the theoretically optimal fixed strategy.",0
"This paper presents a study of improvement in stability in a single machine connected to infinite bus (SMIB) power system by using static compensator (STATCOM). The gains of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in STATCOM are being optimized by heuristic technique based on Particle swarm optimization (PSO). Further, Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) as an alternative heuristic method is also applied to select optimal gains of PID controller. The performance of STATCOM with the above soft-computing techniques are studied and compared with the conventional PID controller under various scenarios. The simulation results are accompanied with performance indices based quantitative analysis. The analysis clearly signifies the robustness of the new scheme in terms of stability and voltage regulation when compared with conventional PID.",0
"We aim at providing a foundation of a theory of ""good"" SAT representations F of boolean functions f. We argue that the hierarchy UC_k of unit-refutation complete clause-sets of level k, introduced by the authors, provides the most basic target classes, that is, F in UC_k is to be achieved for k as small as feasible. If F does not contain new variables, i.e., F is equivalent (as a CNF) to f, then F in UC_1 is similar to ""achieving (generalised) arc consistency"" known from the literature (it is somewhat weaker, but theoretically much nicer to handle). We show that for polysize representations of boolean functions in this sense, the hierarchy UC_k is strict. The boolean functions for these separations are ""doped"" minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets of deficiency 1; these functions have been introduced in [Sloan, Soerenyi, Turan, 2007], and we generalise their construction and show a correspondence to a strengthened notion of irredundant sub-clause-sets. Turning from lower bounds to upper bounds, we believe that many common CNF representations fit into the UC_k scheme, and we give some basic tools to construct representations in UC_1 with new variables, based on the Tseitin translation. Note that regarding new variables the UC_1-representations are stronger than mere ""arc consistency"", since the new variables are not excluded from consideration.",0
"In this paper we explore a class of belief update operators, in which the definition of the operator is compositional with respect to the sentence to be added. The goal is to provide an update operator that is intuitive, in that its definition is based on a recursive decomposition of the update sentences structure, and that may be reasonably implemented. In addressing update, we first provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base. While this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark Katsuno-Mendelzon update postulates, not all of the postulates are satisfied. Other Katsuno-Mendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, as we show. In restricting the syntactic form of the sentence for update, we also obtain a hierarchy of update operators with Winsletts standard semantics as the most basic interesting approach captured. We subsequently give an algorithm which captures this approach; in the general case the algorithm is exponential, but with some not-unreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size of the knowledge base. Hence the resulting approach has much better complexity characteristics than other operators in some situations. We also explore other compositional belief change operators: erasure is developed as a dual operator to update; we show that a forget operator is definable in terms of update; and we give a definition of the compositional revision operator. We obtain that compositional revision, under the most natural definition, yields the Satoh revision operator.",0
"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will transform modern life by reshaping transportation, health, science, finance, and the military. To adapt public policy, we need to better anticipate these advances. Here we report the results from a large survey of machine learning researchers on their beliefs about progress in AI. Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans. These results will inform discussion amongst researchers and policymakers about anticipating and managing trends in AI.",0
"We propose a timed and soft extension of Concurrent Constraint Programming. The time extension is based on the hypothesis of bounded asynchrony: the computation takes a bounded period of time and is measured by a discrete global clock. Action prefixing is then considered as the syntactic marker which distinguishes a time instant from the next one. Supported by soft constraints instead of crisp ones, tell and ask agents are now equipped with a preference (or consistency) threshold which is used to determine their success or suspension. In the paper we provide a language to describe the agents behavior, together with its operational and denotational semantics, for which we also prove the compositionality and correctness properties. After presenting a semantics using maximal parallelism of actions, we also describe a version for their interleaving on a single processor (with maximal parallelism for time elapsing). Coordinating agents that need to take decisions both on preference values and time events may benefit from this language.",0
"Many real life domains contain a mixture of discrete and continuous variables and can be modeled as hybrid Bayesian Networks. Animportant subclass of hybrid BNs are conditional linear Gaussian (CLG) networks, where the conditional distribution of the continuous variables given an assignment to the discrete variables is a multivariate Gaussian. Lauritzen's extension to the clique tree algorithm can be used for exact inference in CLG networks. However, many domains also include discrete variables that depend on continuous ones, and CLG networks do not allow such dependencies to berepresented. No exact inference algorithm has been proposed for these enhanced CLG networks. In this paper, we generalize Lauritzen's algorithm, providing the first ""exact"" inference algorithm for augmented CLG networks - networks where continuous nodes are conditional linear Gaussians but that also allow discrete children ofcontinuous parents. Our algorithm is exact in the sense that it computes the exact distributions over the discrete nodes, and the exact first and second moments of the continuous ones, up to the accuracy obtained by numerical integration used within thealgorithm. When the discrete children are modeled with softmax CPDs (as is the case in many real world domains) the approximation of the continuous distributions using the first two moments is particularly accurate. Our algorithm is simple to implement and often comparable in its complexity to Lauritzen's algorithm. We show empirically that it achieves substantially higher accuracy than previous approximate algorithms.",0
"This paper presents an evaluation of the design decisions made in four state-of-the-art constraint solvers; Choco, ECLiPSe, Gecode, and Minion. To assess the impact of design decisions, instances of the five problem classes n-Queens, Golomb Ruler, Magic Square, Social Golfers, and Balanced Incomplete Block Design are modelled and solved with each solver. The results of the experiments are not meant to give an indication of the performance of a solver, but rather investigate what influence the choice of algorithms and data structures has.",0
"Elicitation of probabilities is one of the most laborious tasks in building decision-theoretic models, and one that has so far received only moderate attention in decision-theoretic systems. We propose a set of user interface tools for graphical probabilistic models, focusing on two aspects of probability elicitation: (1) navigation through conditional probability tables and (2) interactive graphical assessment of discrete probability distributions. We propose two new graphical views that aid navigation in very large conditional probability tables: the CPTree (Conditional Probability Tree) and the SCPT (shrinkable Conditional Probability Table). Based on what is known about graphical presentation of quantitative data to humans, we offer several useful enhancements to probability wheel and bar graph, including different chart styles and options that can be adapted to user preferences and needs. We present the results of a simple usability study that proves the value of the proposed tools.",0
"Bayesian learning of belief networks (BLN) is a method for automatically constructing belief networks (BNs) from data using search and Bayesian scoring techniques. K2 is a particular instantiation of the method that implements a greedy search strategy. To evaluate the accuracy of K2, we randomly generated a number of BNs and for each of those we simulated data sets. K2 was then used to induce the generating BNs from the simulated data. We examine the performance of the program, and the factors that influence it. We also present a simple BN model, developed from our results, which predicts the accuracy of K2, when given various characteristics of the data set.",0
"We study the Monte Carlo method for solving a linear system of the form $x = H x + b$. A sufficient condition for the method to work is $\| H \| &lt; 1$, which greatly limits the usability of this method. We improve this condition by proposing a new multi-way Markov random walk, which is a generalization of the standard Markov random walk. Under our new framework we prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for our method to work is the spectral radius $\rho(H^{+}) &lt; 1$, which is a weaker requirement than $\| H \| &lt; 1$. In addition to solving more problems, our new method can work faster than the standard algorithm. In numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world matrices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method.",0
"This paper presents our experience regarding the creation of 3D semantic facility model out of unorganized 3D point clouds. Thus, a knowledge-based detection approach of objects using the OWL ontology language is presented. This knowledge is used to define SWRL detection rules. In addition, the combination of 3D processing built-ins and topological Built-Ins in SWRL rules aims at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and specialist's knowledge. This combination allows more flexible and intelligent detection and the annotation of objects contained in 3D point clouds. The created WiDOP prototype takes a set of 3D point clouds as input, and produces an indexed scene of colored objects visualized within VRML language as output. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects materialized within the Deutsche Bahn scene such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Therefore, the resulting enriched and populated domain ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS system.",0
"PC(ID) extends propositional logic with inductive definitions: rule sets under the well-founded semantics. Recently, a notion of relevance was introduced for this language. This notion determines the set of undecided literals that can still influence the satisfiability of a PC(ID) formula in a given partial assignment. The idea is that the PC(ID) solver can make decisions only on relevant literals without losing soundness and thus safely ignore irrelevant literals.",0
"In the real world, insufficient information, limited computation resources, and complex problem structures often force an autonomous agent to make a decision in time less than that required to solve the problem at hand completely. Flexible and approximate computations are two approaches to decision making under limited computation resources. Flexible computation helps an agent to flexibly allocate limited computation resources so that the overall system utility is maximized. Approximate computation enables an agent to find the best satisfactory solution within a deadline. In this paper, we present two state-space reduction methods for flexible and approximate computation: quantitative reduction to deal with inaccurate heuristic information, and structural reduction to handle complex problem structures. These two methods can be applied successively to continuously improve solution quality if more computation is available. Our results show that these reduction methods are effective and efficient, finding better solutions with less computation than some existing well-known methods.",0
"The pancake puzzle is a classic optimization problem that has become a standard benchmark for heuristic search algorithms. In this paper, we provide full proofs regarding the local search topology of the gap heuristic for the pancake puzzle. First, we show that in any non-goal state in which there is no move that will decrease the number of gaps, there is a move that will keep the number of gaps constant. We then classify any state in which the number of gaps cannot be decreased in a single action into two groups: those requiring 2 actions to decrease the number of gaps, and those which require 3 actions to decrease the number of gaps.",0
"We look more carefully at the modeling of causality using structural equations. It is clear that the structural equations can have a major impact on the conclusions we draw about causality. In particular, the choice of variables and their values can also have a significant impact on causality. These choices are, to some extent, subjective. We consider what counts as an appropriate choice. More generally, we consider what makes a model an appropriate model, especially if we want to take defaults into account, as was argued is necessary in recent work.",0
"MAP is the problem of finding a most probable instantiation of a set of variables in a Bayesian network, given evidence. Unlike computing marginals, posteriors, and MPE (a special case of MAP), the time and space complexity of MAP is not only exponential in the network treewidth, but also in a larger parameter known as the ""constrained"" treewidth. In practice, this means that computing MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than computingposteriors or MPE. Thus, practitioners generally avoid MAP computations, resorting instead to approximating them by the most likely value for each MAP variableseparately, or by MPE.We present a method for approximating MAP using local search. This method has space complexity which is exponential onlyin the treewidth, as is the complexity of each search step. We investigate the effectiveness of different local searchmethods and several initialization strategies and compare them to otherapproximation schemes.Experimental results show that local search provides a much more accurate approximation of MAP, while requiring few search steps.Practically, this means that the complexity of local search is often exponential only in treewidth as opposed to the constrained treewidth, making approximating MAP as efficient as other computations.",0
"Despite significant developments in Proof Theory, surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the concept of proof verifier. In particular, mathematical community may be interested in studying different types of proof verifiers (people, programs, oracles, communities, superintelligences, etc.) as mathematical objects, their properties, their powers and limitations (particularly in human mathematicians), minimum and maximum complexity, as well as self-verification and self-reference issues in verifiers. We propose an initial classification system for verifiers and provide some rudimentary analysis of solved and open problems in this important domain. Our main contribution is a formal introduction of the notion of unverifiability, for which the paper could serve as a general citation in domains of theorem proving, software and AI verification.",0
"Lifting attempts to speed up probabilistic inference by exploiting symmetries in the model. Exact lifted inference methods, like their propositional counterparts, work by recursively decomposing the model and the problem. In the propositional case, there exist formal structures, such as decomposition trees (dtrees), that represent such a decomposition and allow us to determine the complexity of inference a priori. However, there is currently no equivalent structure nor analogous complexity results for lifted inference. In this paper, we introduce FO-dtrees, which upgrade propositional dtrees to the first-order level. We show how these trees can characterize a lifted inference solution for a probabilistic logical model (in terms of a sequence of lifted operations), and make a theoretical analysis of the complexity of lifted inference in terms of the novel notion of lifted width for the tree.",1
"Modelling problems containing a mixture of Boolean and numerical variables is a long-standing interest of Artificial Intelligence. However, performing inference and learning in hybrid domains is a particularly daunting task. The ability to model this kind of domains is crucial in ""learning to design"" tasks, that is, learning applications where the goal is to learn from examples how to perform automatic de novo design of novel objects. In this paper we present Structured Learning Modulo Theories, a max-margin approach for learning in hybrid domains based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories, which allows to combine Boolean reasoning and optimization over continuous linear arithmetical constraints. We validate our method on artificial and real world scenarios.",0
"We propose a perspective on knowledge compilation which calls for analyzing different compilation approaches according to two key dimensions: the succinctness of the target compilation language, and the class of queries and transformations that the language supports in polytime. We then provide a knowledge compilation map, which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and queries. We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target compilation languages.",0
"We present a case study of artificial intelligence techniques applied to the control of production printing equipment. Like many other real-world applications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomous decision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful industrial application of embedded domain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures and multi-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combines techniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggest that this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more intelligent systems operate in continual, on-line settings. Our system has been used to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product architecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-art off-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds better plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planning based on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, and multiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiring hand-coded control knowledge.",0
"This paper reconsiders the problem of the absent-minded driver who must choose between alternatives with different payoff with imperfect recall and varying degrees of knowledge of the system. The classical absent-minded driver problem represents the case with limited information and it has bearing on the general area of communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, theories of knowledge, belief, and rational agency. Within the framework of extensive games, this problem has applications to many artificial intelligence scenarios. It is obvious that the performance of the agent improves as information available increases. It is shown that a non-uniform assignment strategy for successive choices does better than a fixed probability strategy. We consider both classical and quantum approaches to the problem. We argue that the superior performance of quantum decisions with access to entanglement cannot be fairly compared to a classical algorithm. If the cognitive systems of agents are taken to have access to quantum resources, or have a quantum mechanical basis, then that can be leveraged into superior performance.",0
"In semantic technologies, the shared common understanding of the structure of information among artifacts (people or software agents) can be realized by building an ontology. To do this, it is imperative for an ontology builder to answer several questions: a) what are the main components of an ontology? b) How an ontology look likes and how it works? c) Verify if it is required to consider reusing existing ontologies or not? c) What is the complexity of the ontology to be developed? d) What are the principles of ontology design and development? e) How to evaluate an ontology? This paper answers all the key questions above. The aim of this paper is to present a set of guiding principles to help ontology developers and also inexperienced users to answer such questions.",0
"In Operation Research, practical evaluation is essential to validate the efficacy of optimization approaches. This paper promotes the usage of performance profiles as a standard practice to visualize and analyze experimental results. It introduces a Web tool to construct and export performance profiles as SVG or HTML files. In addition, the application relies on a methodology to estimate the benefit of hypothetical solver improvements. Therefore, the tool allows one to employ what-if analysis to screen possible research directions, and identify those having the best potential. The approach is showcased on two Operation Research technologies: Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Linear Programming.",0
"Potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) is an effective and popular technique to speed up reinforcement learning by leveraging domain knowledge. While PBRS is proven to always preserve optimal policies, its effect on learning speed is determined by the quality of its potential function, which, in turn, depends on both the underlying heuristic and the scale. Knowing which heuristic will prove effective requires testing the options beforehand, and determining the appropriate scale requires tuning, both of which introduce additional sample complexity. We formulate a PBRS framework that reduces learning speed, but does not incur extra sample complexity. For this, we propose to simultaneously learn an ensemble of policies, shaped w.r.t. many heuristics and on a range of scales. The target policy is then obtained by voting. The ensemble needs to be able to efficiently and reliably learn off-policy: requirements fulfilled by the recent Horde architecture, which we take as our basis. We demonstrate empirically that (1) our ensemble policy outperforms both the base policy, and its single-heuristic components, and (2) an ensemble over a general range of scales performs at least as well as one with optimally tuned components.",0
"The local computation technique (Shafer et al. 1987, Shafer and Shenoy 1988, Shenoy and Shafer 1986) is used for propagating belief functions in so called a Markov Tree. In this paper, we describe an efficient implementation of belief function propagation on the basis of the local computation technique. The presented method avoids all the redundant computations in the propagation process, and so makes the computational complexity decrease with respect to other existing implementations (Hsia and Shenoy 1989, Zarley et al. 1988). We also give a combined algorithm for both propagation and re-propagation which makes the re-propagation process more efficient when one or more of the prior belief functions is changed.",0
"Without discourse connectives, classifying implicit discourse relations is a challenging task and a bottleneck for building a practical discourse parser. Previous research usually makes use of one kind of discourse framework such as PDTB or RST to improve the classification performance on discourse relations. Actually, under different discourse annotation frameworks, there exist multiple corpora which have internal connections. To exploit the combination of different discourse corpora, we design related discourse classification tasks specific to a corpus, and propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network embedded multi-task learning system to synthesize these tasks by learning both unique and shared representations for each task. The experimental results on the PDTB implicit discourse relation classification task demonstrate that our model achieves significant gains over baseline systems.",1
"The 2002 Trading Agent Competition (TAC) presented a challenging market game in the domain of travel shopping. One of the pivotal issues in this domain is uncertainty about hotel prices, which have a significant influence on the relative cost of alternative trip schedules. Thus, virtually all participants employ some method for predicting hotel prices. We survey approaches employed in the tournament, finding that agents apply an interesting diversity of techniques, taking into account differing sources of evidence bearing on prices. Based on data provided by entrants on their agents' actual predictions in the TAC-02 finals and semifinals, we analyze the relative efficacy of these approaches. The results show that taking into account game-specific information about flight prices is a major distinguishing factor. Machine learning methods effectively induce the relationship between flight and hotel prices from game data, and a purely analytical approach based on competitive equilibrium analysis achieves equal accuracy with no historical data. Employing a new measure of prediction quality, we relate absolute accuracy to bottom-line performance in the game.",0
"Artificial intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to achieve goals in the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded as reward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewards provide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal, or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback, agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking intentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification of purposes that are ""just out of reach"" of the agent's current behaviour. These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately resulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different parts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for settings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the exploration of the environment until reward is observed.",0
"The weighted Maximum Satisfiability problem (weighted MAX-SAT) is a NP-hard problem with numerous applications arising in artificial intelligence. As an efficient tool for heuristic design, the backbone has been applied to heuristics design for many NP-hard problems. In this paper, we investigated the computational complexity for retrieving the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT and developed a new algorithm for solving this problem. We showed that it is intractable to retrieve the full backbone under the assumption that . Moreover, it is intractable to retrieve a fixed fraction of the backbone as well. And then we presented a backbone guided local search (BGLS) with Walksat operator for weighted MAX-SAT. BGLS consists of two phases: the first phase samples the backbone information from local optima and the backbone phase conducts local search under the guideline of backbone. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark showed that BGLS outperforms the existing heuristics in both solution quality and runtime.",0
"Hashing-based model counting has emerged as a promising approach for large-scale probabilistic inference on graphical models. A key component of these techniques is the use of xor-based 2-universal hash functions that operate over Boolean domains. Many counting problems arising in probabilistic inference are, however, naturally encoded over finite discrete domains. Techniques based on bit-level (or Boolean) hash functions require these problems to be propositionalized, making it impossible to leverage the remarkable progress made in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solvers that can reason directly over words (or bit-vectors). In this work, we present the first approximate model counter that uses word-level hashing functions, and can directly leverage the power of sophisticated SMT solvers. Empirical evaluation over an extensive suite of benchmarks demonstrates the promise of the approach.",1
"The paper focuses on mining patterns that are characterized by a fuzzy lagged relationship between the data objects forming them. Such a regulatory mechanism is quite common in real life settings. It appears in a variety of fields: finance, gene expression, neuroscience, crowds and collective movements are but a limited list of examples. Mining such patterns not only helps in understanding the relationship between objects in the domain, but assists in forecasting their future behavior. For most interesting variants of this problem, finding an optimal fuzzy lagged co-cluster is an NP-complete problem. We thus present a polynomial-time Monte-Carlo approximation algorithm for mining fuzzy lagged co-clusters. We prove that for any data matrix, the algorithm mines a fuzzy lagged co-cluster with fixed probability, which encompasses the optimal fuzzy lagged co-cluster by a maximum 2 ratio columns overhead and completely no rows overhead. Moreover, the algorithm handles noise, anti-correlations, missing values and overlapping patterns. The algorithm was extensively evaluated using both artificial and real datasets. The results not only corroborate the ability of the algorithm to efficiently mine relevant and accurate fuzzy lagged co-clusters, but also illustrate the importance of including the fuzziness in the lagged-pattern model.",0
"This article generalizes object-oriented dynamic networks to the fuzzy case, which allows one to represent knowledge on objects and classes of objects that are fuzzy by nature and also to model their changes in time. Within the framework of the approach described, a mechanism is proposed that makes it possible to acquire new knowledge on the basis of basic knowledge and considerably differs from well-known methods used in existing models of knowledge representation. The approach is illustrated by an example of construction of a concrete fuzzy object-oriented dynamic network.",0
"In this paper, a new learning algorithm for adaptive network intrusion detection using naive Bayesian classifier and decision tree is presented, which performs balance detections and keeps false positives at acceptable level for different types of network attacks, and eliminates redundant attributes as well as contradictory examples from training data that make the detection model complex. The proposed algorithm also addresses some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attribute, dealing with missing attribute values, and reducing noise in training data. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data miningbased intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last decades. However, there remain various issues needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection systems (IDS). We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm with existing learning algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduce false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.",0
"We investigate the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS) computational creativity approach further with respect to the size and quality of images that can be used to seed the process. In previous work we demonstrated how combining photographs of people and sequences taken from chess games between weak players can be used to generate chess problems or puzzles of higher aesthetic quality, on average, compared to alternative approaches. In this work we show experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less corrupted images. The reasons why these things influence the DSNS process is presently not well-understood and debatable but the findings are nevertheless immediately applicable for obtaining better results.",0
"We propose a software architecture designed to ease the implementation of dialogue systems. The Modular Architecture for Conversational Agents (MACA) uses a plug-n-play style that allows quick prototyping, thereby facilitating the development of new techniques and the reproduction of previous work. The architecture separates the domain of the conversation from the agent's dialogue strategy, and as such can be easily extended to multiple domains. MACA provides tools to host dialogue agents on Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) for data collection and allows processing of other sources of training data. The current version of the framework already incorporates several domains and existing dialogue strategies from the recent literature.",0
"In this paper we propose a non-metric ranking-based representation of semantic similarity that allows natural aggregation of semantic information from multiple heterogeneous sources. We apply the ranking-based representation to zero-shot learning problems, and present deterministic and probabilistic zero-shot classifiers which can be built from pre-trained classifiers without retraining. We demonstrate their the advantages on two large real-world image datasets. In particular, we show that aggregating different sources of semantic information, including crowd-sourcing, leads to more accurate classification.",0
"We present four novel approximation algorithms for finding triangulation of minimum treewidth. Two of the algorithms improve on the running times of algorithms by Robertson and Seymour, and Becker and Geiger that approximate the optimum by factors of 4 and 3 2/3, respectively. A third algorithm is faster than those but gives an approximation factor of 4 1/2. The last algorithm is yet faster, producing factor-O(lg/k) approximations in polynomial time. Finding triangulations of minimum treewidth for graphs is central to many problems in computer science. Real-world problems in artificial intelligence, VLSI design and databases are efficiently solvable if we have an efficient approximation algorithm for them. We report on experimental results confirming the effectiveness of our algorithms for large graphs associated with real-world problems.",0
"Critical Infrastructures like power and communication networks are highly interdependent on each other for their full functionality. Many significant research have been pursued to model the interdependency and failure analysis of these interdependent networks. However, most of these models fail to capture the complex interdependencies that might actually exist between the infrastructures. The \emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} that utilizes Boolean Logic to capture complex interdependencies was recently proposed which overcome the limitations of the existing models. A number of problems were studies based on this model. In this paper we study the \textit{Robustness} problem in Interdependent Power and Communication Network. The robustness is defined with respect to two parameters $K \in I^{+} \cup \{0\}$ and $\rho \in (0,1]$. We utilized the \emph{Implicative Interdependency Model} model to capture the complex interdependency between the two networks. The model classifies the interdependency relations into four cases. Computational complexity of the problem is analyzed for each of these cases. A polynomial time algorithm is designed for the first case that outputs the optimal solution. All the other cases are proved to be NP-complete. An in-approximability bound is provided for the third case. For the general case we formulate an Integer Linear Program to get the optimal solution and a polynomial time heuristic. The applicability of the heuristic is evaluated using power and communication network data of Maricopa County, Arizona. The experimental results showed that the heuristic almost always produced near optimal value of parameter $K$ for $\rho &lt; 0.42$.",0
"We define a problem theory from first principles. We investigate the objects of this theory: problems, resolutions, and solutions. We relate problem theory with set theory and with computing theory. We find taxonomies for resolutions and for problems. We build a hierarchy of resolvers: mechanism, adaptor, internalizer, learner, and subject. We show that the problem theory is complete. Finally, we propose a thesis: We are Turing complete subjects because we are the result of an evolution of resolvers of the survival problem.",0
"This work presents a model for the Tramp Ship Scheduling problem including berth allocation considerations, motivated by a real case of a shipping company. The aim is to determine the travel schedule for each vessel considering multiple docking and multiple time windows at the berths. This work is innovative due to the consideration of both spatial and temporal attributes during the scheduling process. The resulting model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, and a heuristic method to deal with multiple vessel schedules is also presented. Numerical experimentation is performed to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach and the applicability of the heuristic. Conclusions and recommendations for further research are provided.",0
"Using an interactive theorem prover to reason about programs involves a sequence of interactions where the user challenges the theorem prover with conjectures. Invariably, many of the conjectures posed are in fact false, and users often spend considerable effort examining the theorem prover's output before realizing this. We present a synergistic integration of testing with theorem proving, implemented in the ACL2 Sedan (ACL2s), for automatically generating concrete counterexamples. Our method uses the full power of the theorem prover and associated libraries to simplify conjectures; this simplification can transform conjectures for which finding counterexamples is hard into conjectures where finding counterexamples is trivial. In fact, our approach even leads to better theorem proving, e.g., if testing shows that a generalization step leads to a false conjecture, we force the theorem prover to backtrack, allowing it to pursue more fruitful options that may yield a proof. The focus of the paper is on the engineering of a synergistic integration of testing with interactive theorem proving; this includes extending ACL2 with new functionality that we expect to be of general interest. We also discuss our experience in using ACL2s to teach freshman students how to reason about their programs.",0
"Due to imprecision and uncertainties in predicting real world problems, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques have become increasingly useful for modeling and optimization. This paper presents an artificial neural network approach for forecasting electric energy consumption. For effective planning and operation of power systems, optimal forecasting tools are needed for energy operators to maximize profit and also to provide maximum satisfaction to energy consumers. Monthly data for electric energy consumed in the Gaza strip was collected from year 1994 to 2013. Data was trained and the proposed model was validated using 2-Fold and K-Fold cross validation techniques. The model has been tested with actual energy consumption data and yields satisfactory performance.",0
"We present a first theoretical analysis of the power of polynomial-time preprocessing for important combinatorial problems from various areas in AI. We consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints, Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning. We show that, subject to a complexity theoretic assumption, none of the considered problems can be reduced by polynomial-time preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural problem parameter of the input, such as induced width or backdoor size. Our results provide a firm theoretical boundary for the performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered problems.",1
"Divide and Conquer (DC) is conceptually well suited to high-dimensional optimization by decomposing a problem into multiple small-scale sub-problems. However, appealing performance can be seldom observed when the sub-problems are interdependent. This paper suggests that the major difficulty of tackling interdependent sub-problems lies in the precise evaluation of a partial solution (to a sub-problem), which can be overwhelmingly costly and thus makes sub-problems non-trivial to conquer. Thus, we propose an approximation approach, named Divide and Approximate Conquer (DAC), which reduces the cost of partial solution evaluation from exponential time to polynomial time. Meanwhile, the convergence to the global optimum (of the original problem) is still guaranteed. The effectiveness of DAC is demonstrated empirically on two sets of non-separable high-dimensional problems.",0
"RockIt is a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) query engine for statistical relational models. MAP inference in graphical models is an optimization problem which can be compiled to integer linear programs (ILPs). We describe several advances in translating MAP queries to ILP instances and present the novel meta-algorithm cutting plane aggregation (CPA). CPA exploits local context-specific symmetries and bundles up sets of linear constraints. The resulting counting constraints lead to more compact ILPs and make the symmetry of the ground model more explicit to state-of-the-art ILP solvers. Moreover, RockIt parallelizes most parts of the MAP inference pipeline taking advantage of ubiquitous shared-memory multi-core architectures.",1
"This paper proposes to use probabilistic model checking to synthesize optimal robot policies in multi-tasking autonomous systems that are subject to human-robot interaction. Given the convincing empirical evidence that human behavior can be related to reinforcement models, we take as input a well-studied Q-table model of the human behavior for flexible scenarios. We first describe an automated procedure to distill a Markov decision process (MDP) for the human in an arbitrary but fixed scenario. The distinctive issue is that -- in contrast to existing models -- under-specification of the human behavior is included. Probabilistic model checking is used to predict the human's behavior. Finally, the MDP model is extended with a robot model. Optimal robot policies are synthesized by analyzing the resulting two-player stochastic game. Experimental results with a prototypical implementation using PRISM show promising results.",0
"Belief revision of knowledge bases represented by a set of sentences in a given logic has been extensively studied but for specific logics, mainly propositional, but also recently Horn and description logics. Here, we propose to generalize this operation from a model-theoretic point of view, by defining revision in a categorical abstract model theory known under the name of theory of institutions. In this framework, we generalize to any institution the characterization of the well known AGM postulates given by Katsuno and Mendelzon for propositional logic in terms of minimal change with respect to an ordering among interpretations. Moreover, we study how to define revision, satisfying the AGM postulates, from relaxation notions that have been first introduced in description logics to define dissimilarity measures between concepts, and the consequence of which is to relax the set of models of the old belief until it becomes consistent with the new pieces of knowledge. The proposed general framework can be instantiated in different logics such as propositional, description and Horn logics.",0
"In this paper, we develop an agent-based model which integrates four important elements, i.e. organisational energy management policies/regulations, energy management technologies, electric appliances and equipment, and human behaviour, to simulate the electricity consumption in office buildings. Based on a case study, we use this model to test the effectiveness of different electricity management strategies, and solve practical office electricity consumption problems. This paper theoretically contributes to an integration of the four elements involved in the complex organisational issue of office electricity consumption, and practically contributes to an application of an agent-based approach for office building electricity consumption study.",0
"Although the use of metric fluents is fundamental to many practical planning problems, the study of heuristics to support fully automated planners working with these fluents remains relatively unexplored. The most widely used heuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables --- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain encodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity constraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to these approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that represent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials into quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The usual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations, since it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available to be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems building on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical program for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planning problems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled in a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric Relaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid heuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual relaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the causal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two components interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore how further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the MIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to augment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting structure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our results show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems where numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.",0
"There are many applications in which it is desirable to order rather than classify instances. Here we consider the problem of learning how to order instances given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a binary preference function indicating whether it is advisable to rank one instance before another. Here we consider an on-line algorithm for learning preference functions that is based on Freund and Schapire's 'Hedge' algorithm. In the second stage, new instances are ordered so as to maximize agreement with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a learned preference function is NP-complete. Nevertheless, we describe simple greedy algorithms that are guaranteed to find a good approximation. Finally, we show how metasearch can be formulated as an ordering problem, and present experimental results on learning a combination of 'search experts', each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a web search engine.",0
"The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) involves deciding, given a set of variables and a set of constraints on the variables, whether or not there is an assignment to the variables satisfying all of the constraints. One formulation of the CSP is as the problem of deciding, given a pair (G,H) of relational structures, whether or not there is a homomorphism from the first structure to the second structure. The CSP is in general NP-hard; a common way to restrict this problem is to fix the second structure H, so that each structure H gives rise to a problem CSP(H). The problem family CSP(H) has been studied using an algebraic approach, which links the algorithmic and complexity properties of each problem CSP(H) to a set of operations, the so-called polymorphisms of H. Certain types of polymorphisms are known to imply the polynomial-time tractability of $CSP(H)$, and others are conjectured to do so. This article systematically studies---for various classes of polymorphisms---the computational complexity of deciding whether or not a given structure H admits a polymorphism from the class. Among other results, we prove the NP-completeness of deciding a condition conjectured to characterize the tractable problems CSP(H), as well as the NP-completeness of deciding if CSP(H) has bounded width.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods have performed well in an increasing numbering of high-dimensional visual decision making domains. Among all such visual decision making problems, those with discrete action spaces often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space. Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left, go up as well as go diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm, Factored Action space Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components, analogous to decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the agent to learn about multiple actions simultaneously, while executing only one of them. We demonstrate that FAR yields considerable improvements on top of two DRL algorithms in Atari 2600: FARA3C outperforms A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) in 9 out of 14 tasks and FARAQL outperforms AQL (Asynchronous n-step Q-Learning) in 9 out of 13 tasks.",0
Recent neural network sequence models with softmax classifiers have achieved their best language modeling performance only with very large hidden states and large vocabularies. Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity) while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with more realistic vocabularies and larger corpora we also introduce the freely available WikiText corpus.,1
"One of the most important aims of the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence and artificial life is the design and construction of systems and machines as versatile and as reliable as living organisms at performing high level human-like tasks. But how are we to evaluate artificial systems if we are not certain how to measure these capabilities in living systems, let alone how to define life or intelligence? Here I survey a concrete metric towards measuring abstract properties of natural and artificial systems, such as the ability to react to the environment and to control one's own behaviour.",0
"We present several techniques for knowledge engineering of large belief networks (BNs) based on the our experiences with a network derived from a large medical knowledge base. The noisyMAX, a generalization of the noisy-OR gate, is used to model causal in dependence in a BN with multi-valued variables. We describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the closed-world assumption in our model. We present Netview, a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities. The Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view sub-networks for knowledge engineering, and it provides version control for editing a BN. Netview generates sub-networks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network.",0
"In this paper we present an extension of Peirce's existential graphs to provide a diagrammatic representation of expressions in Quantified Equilibrium Logic (QEL). Using this formalisation, logical connectives are replaced by encircled regions (circles and squares) and quantified variables are represented as ""identity"" lines. Although the expressive power is equivalent to that of QEL, the new representation can be useful for illustrative or educational purposes.",0
Planning is a notoriously difficult computational problem of high worst-case complexity. Researchers have been investing significant efforts to develop heuristics or restrictions to make planning practically feasible. Case-based planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience when solving similar problems in order to avoid some of the planning effort. Plan reuse may offer an interesting alternative to plan generation in some settings.,1
"Large sparse sets of binary transaction data with millions of records and thousands of attributes occur in various domains: customers purchasing products, users visiting web pages, and documents containing words are just three typical examples. Real-time query selectivity estimation (the problem of estimating the number of rows in the data satisfying a given predicate) is an important practical problem for such databases.",0
"Ubiquitous information access becomes more and more important nowadays and research is aimed at making it adapted to users. Our work consists in applying machine learning techniques in order to adapt the information access provided by ubiquitous systems to users when the system only knows the user social group, without knowing anything about the user interest. The adaptation procedures associate actions to perceived situations of the user. Associations are based on feedback given by the user as a reaction to the behavior of the system. Our method brings a solution to some of the problems concerning the acceptance of the system by users when applying machine learning techniques to systems at the beginning of the interaction between the system and the user.",0
"Lossy image compression algorithms are pervasively used to reduce the size of images transmitted over the web and recorded on data storage media. However, we pay for their high compression rate with visual artifacts degrading the user experience. Deep convolutional neural networks have become a widespread tool to address high-level computer vision tasks very successfully. Recently, they have found their way into the areas of low-level computer vision and image processing to solve regression problems mostly with relatively shallow networks.",0
"The logic of knowledge and justified assumptions, also known as logic of grounded knowledge (GK), was proposed by Lin and Shoham as a general logic for nonmonotonic reasoning. To date, it has been used to embed in it default logic (propositional case), autoepistemic logic, Turner's logic of universal causation, and general logic programming under stable model semantics. Besides showing the generality of GK as a logic for nonmonotonic reasoning, these embeddings shed light on the relationships among these other logics. In this paper, for the first time, we show how the logic of GK can be embedded into disjunctive logic programming in a polynomial but non-modular translation with new variables. The result can then be used to compute the extension/expansion semantics of default logic, autoepistemic logic and Turner's logic of universal causation by disjunctive ASP solvers such as claspD(-2), DLV, GNT and cmodels.",0
"We devise the Unit Commitment Nearest Neighbor (UCNN) algorithm to be used as a proxy for quickly approximating outcomes of short-term decisions, to make tractable hierarchical long-term assessment and planning for large power systems. Experimental results on an updated version of IEEE-RTS96 show high accuracy measured on operational cost, achieved in run-times that are lower in several orders of magnitude than the traditional approach.",0
"As probabilistic systems gain popularity and are coming into wider use, the need for a mechanism that explains the system's findings and recommendations becomes more critical. The system will also need a mechanism for ordering competing explanations. We examine two representative approaches to explanation in the literature - one due to G\""ardenfors and one due to Pearl - and show that both suffer from significant problems. We propose an approach to defining a notion of ""better explanation"" that combines some of the features of both together with more recent work by Pearl and others on causality.",0
"We consider how an agent should update her beliefs when her beliefs are represented by a set P of probability distributions, given that the agent makes decisions using the minimax criterion, perhaps the best-studied and most commonly-used criterion in the literature. We adopt a game-theoretic framework, where the agent plays against a bookie, who chooses some distribution from P. We consider two reasonable games that differ in what the bookie knows when he makes his choice. Anomalies that have been observed before, like time inconsistency, can be understood as arising because different games are being played, against bookies with different information. We characterize the important special cases in which the optimal decision rules according to the minimax criterion amount to either conditioning or simply ignoring the information. Finally, we consider the relationship between updating and calibration when uncertainty is described by sets of probabilities. Our results emphasize the key role of the rectangularity condition of Epstein and Schneider.",0
"Expert finding is an information retrieval task concerned with the search for the most knowledgeable people, in some topic, with basis on documents describing peoples activities. The task involves taking a user query as input and returning a list of people sorted by their level of expertise regarding the user query. This paper introduces a novel approach for combining multiple estimators of expertise based on a multisensor data fusion framework together with the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence and Shannon's entropy. More specifically, we defined three sensors which detect heterogeneous information derived from the textual contents, from the graph structure of the citation patterns for the community of experts, and from profile information about the academic experts. Given the evidences collected, each sensor may define different candidates as experts and consequently do not agree in a final ranking decision. To deal with these conflicts, we applied the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence combined with Shannon's Entropy formula to fuse this information and come up with a more accurate and reliable final ranking list. Experiments made over two datasets of academic publications from the Computer Science domain attest for the adequacy of the proposed approach over the traditional state of the art approaches. We also made experiments against representative supervised state of the art algorithms. Results revealed that the proposed method achieved a similar performance when compared to these supervised techniques, confirming the capabilities of the proposed framework.",0
"The use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent conditional independence relations among random variables has proved fruitful in a variety of ways. Recursive structural equation models are one kind of DAG model. However, non-recursive structural equation models of the kinds used to model economic processes are naturally represented by directed cyclic graphs with independent errors, a characterization of conditional independence errors, a characterization of conditional independence constraints is obtained, and it is shown that the result generalizes in a natural way to systems in which the error variables or noises are statistically dependent. For non-linear systems with independent errors a sufficient condition for conditional independence of variables in associated distributions is obtained.",0
"Management of chronic diseases such as heart failure, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major problem in health care. A standard approach that the medical community has devised to manage widely prevalent chronic diseases such as chronic heart failure (CHF) is to have a committee of experts develop guidelines that all physicians should follow. These guidelines typically consist of a series of complex rules that make recommendations based on a patient's information. Due to their complexity, often the guidelines are either ignored or not complied with at all, which can result in poor medical practices. It is not even clear whether it is humanly possible to follow these guidelines due to their length and complexity. In the case of CHF management, the guidelines run nearly 80 pages. In this paper we describe a physician-advisory system for CHF management that codes the entire set of clinical practice guidelines for CHF using answer set programming. Our approach is based on developing reasoning templates (that we call knowledge patterns) and using these patterns to systemically code the clinical guidelines for CHF as ASP rules. Use of the knowledge patterns greatly facilitates the development of our system. Given a patient's medical information, our system generates a recommendation for treatment just as a human physician would, using the guidelines. Our system will work even in the presence of incomplete information. Our work makes two contributions: (i) it shows that highly complex guidelines can be successfully coded as ASP rules, and (ii) it develops a series of knowledge patterns that facilitate the coding of knowledge expressed in a natural language and that can be used for other application domains. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.",0
"We present a novel approach to constraint-based causal discovery, that takes the form of straightforward logical inference, applied to a list of simple, logical statements about causal relations that are derived directly from observed (in)dependencies. It is both sound and complete, in the sense that all invariant features of the corresponding partial ancestral graph (PAG) are identified, even in the presence of latent variables and selection bias. The approach shows that every identifiable causal relation corresponds to one of just two fundamental forms. More importantly, as the basic building blocks of the method do not rely on the detailed (graphical) structure of the corresponding PAG, it opens up a range of new opportunities, including more robust inference, detailed accountability, and application to large models.",0
"Bisimulations have been widely used in many areas of computer science to model equivalence between various systems, and to reduce the number of states of these systems, whereas uniform fuzzy relations have recently been introduced as a means to model the fuzzy equivalence between elements of two possible different sets. Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful tool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a uniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ is a forward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ and there is a special isomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy equivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ are UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them, if and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata of $\cal A$ and $\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation fuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence to the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely related to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar results for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental differences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and forward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give a comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic, nondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to bisimulations.",0
"Large scale classification of data organized as a hierarchy of classes has received significant attention in the literature. Top-Down (TD) Hierarchical Classification (HC), which exploits the hierarchical structure during the learning process is an effective method for dealing with problems at scale due to its computational benefits. However, its accuracy suffers due to error propagation i.e., prediction errors made at higher levels in the hierarchy cannot be corrected at lower levels. One of the main reasons behind errors at the higher levels is the presence of inconsistent nodes and links that are introduced due to the arbitrary process of creating these hierarchies by domain experts. In this paper, we propose two efficient data driven filter based approaches for hierarchical structure modification: (i) Flattening (local and global) approach that identifies and removes inconsistent nodes present within the hierarchy and (ii) Rewiring approach modifies parent-child relationships to improve the classification performance of learned models. Our extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed approaches on several image and text datasets shows improved performance over competing approaches.",0
"As ontologies and description logics (DLs) reach out to a broader audience, several reasoning services are developed in this context. Belief revision is one of them, of prime importance when knowledge is prone to change and inconsistency. In this paper we address both the generalization of the well-known AGM postulates, and the definition of concrete and well-founded revision operators in different DL families. We introduce a model-theoretic version of the AGM postulates with a general definition of inconsistency, hence enlarging their scope to a wide family of non-classical logics, in particular negation-free DL families. We propose a general framework for defining revision operators based on the notion of relaxation, introduced recently for defining dissimilarity measures between DL concepts. A revision operator in this framework amounts to relax the set of models of the old belief until it reaches the sets of models of the new piece of knowledge. We demonstrate that such a relaxation-based revision operator defines a faithful assignment and satisfies the generalized AGM postulates. Another important contribution concerns the definition of several concrete relaxation operators suited to the syntax of some DLs (ALC and its fragments EL and ELU).",0
"Human understanding of narrative is mainly driven by reasoning about causal relations between events and thus recognizing them is a key capability for computational models of language understanding. Computational work in this area has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to understand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that newswire is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations between everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method to learn causal relations between events in the narrative genres of first-person narratives and film scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80% of the time. We also demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.",0
"We introduce a new type of graphical model that we call a ""memory factor network"" (MFN). We show how to use MFNs to model the structure inherent in many types of data sets. We also introduce an associated message-passing style algorithm called ""proactive message passing""' (PMP) that performs inference on MFNs. PMP comes with convergence guarantees and is efficient in comparison to competing algorithms such as variants of belief propagation. We specialize MFNs and PMP to a number of distinct types of data (discrete, continuous, labelled) and inference problems (interpolation, hypothesis testing), provide examples, and discuss approaches for efficient implementation.",0
"Designing the dialogue policy of a spoken dialogue system involves many nontrivial choices. This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach for automatically optimizing a dialogue policy, which addresses the technical challenges in applying reinforcement learning to a working dialogue system with human users. We report on the design, construction and empirical evaluation of NJFun, an experimental spoken dialogue system that provides users with access to information about fun things to do in New Jersey. Our results show that by optimizing its performance via reinforcement learning, NJFun measurably improves system performance.",0
"A definition of intelligence is given in terms of performance that can be quantitatively measured. In this study, we have presented a conceptual model of Intelligent Agent System for Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). To achieve this goal, we have introduced several kinds of agents that exhibit intelligent features. These are the Management agent, internal agent, External Agent, Watcher agent and Report agent. Metrics and measurements are suggested for evaluating the performance of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). Calibrate data and test facilities are suggested to facilitate the development of intelligent systems.",0
"Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a widely-used supervised dimensionality reduction method in computer vision and pattern recognition. In null space based LDA (NLDA), a well-known LDA extension, between-class distance is maximized in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix. However, there are some limitations in NLDA. Firstly, for many data sets, null space of within-class scatter matrix does not exist, thus NLDA is not applicable to those datasets. Secondly, NLDA uses arithmetic mean of between-class distances and gives equal consideration to all between-class distances, which makes larger between-class distances can dominate the result and thus limits the performance of NLDA. In this paper, we propose a harmonic mean based Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis (MCDA), for image classification, which minimizes the reciprocal of weighted harmonic mean of pairwise between-class distance. More importantly, MCDA gives higher priority to maximize small between-class distances. MCDA can be extended to multi-label dimension reduction. Results on 7 single-label data sets and 4 multi-label data sets show that MCDA has consistently better performance than 10 other single-label approaches and 4 other multi-label approaches in terms of classification accuracy, macro and micro average F1 score.",0
"We study the problem of finding appropriate experts who are able to complete timely reviews and would not say ""no"" to the invitation. The problem is a central issue in many question-and-answer systems, but has received little research attention. Different from most existing studies that focus on expertise matching, we want to further predict the expert's response: given a question, how can we find the expert who is able to provide a quality review and will agree to do it. We formalize the problem as a ranking problem. We first present an embedding-based question-to-expert distance metric for expertise matching and propose a ranking factor graph (RankFG) model to predict expert response. For online evaluation, we developed a Chrome Extension for reviewer recommendation and deployed it in the Google Chrome Web Store, and then collected the reviewers' feedback. We also used the review bidding of a CS conference for evaluation. In the experiments, the proposed method demonstrates its superiority (+6.6-21.2% by MAP) over several state-of-the-art algorithms.",0
"We introduce a problem set-up we call the Iterated Matching Pennies (IMP) game and show that it is a powerful framework for the study of three problems: adversarial learnability, conventional (i.e., non-adversarial) learnability and approximability. Using it, we are able to derive the following theorems. (1) It is possible to learn by example all of $\Sigma^0_1 \cup \Pi^0_1$ as well as some supersets; (2) in adversarial learning (which we describe as a pursuit-evasion game), the pursuer has a winning strategy (in other words, $\Sigma^0_1$ can be learned adversarially, but $\Pi^0_1$ not); (3) some languages in $\Pi^0_1$ cannot be approximated by any language in $\Sigma^0_1$.",0
"Motivated by online settings where users can provide explicit feedback about the relevance of products that are sequentially presented to them, we look at the recommendation process as a problem of dynamically optimizing this relevance feedback. Such an algorithm optimizes the fine tradeoff between presenting the products that are most likely to be relevant, and learning the preferences of the user so that more relevant recommendations can be made in the future.",0
Empirical evidence suggests that hashing is an effective strategy for dimensionality reduction and practical nonparametric estimation. In this paper we provide exponential tail bounds for feature hashing and show that the interaction between random subspaces is negligible with high probability. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with experimental results for a new use case -- multitask learning with hundreds of thousands of tasks.,1
"Building systems that possess the sensitivity and intelligence to identify and describe high-level attributes in music audio signals continues to be an elusive goal, but one that surely has broad and deep implications for a wide variety of applications. Hundreds of papers have so far been published toward this goal, and great progress appears to have been made. Some systems produce remarkable accuracies at recognising high-level semantic concepts, such as music style, genre and mood. However, it might be that these numbers do not mean what they seem. In this paper, we take a state-of-the-art music content analysis system and investigate what causes it to achieve exceptionally high performance in a benchmark music audio dataset. We dissect the system to understand its operation, determine its sensitivities and limitations, and predict the kinds of knowledge it could and could not possess about music. We perform a series of experiments to illuminate what the system has actually learned to do, and to what extent it is performing the intended music listening task. Our results demonstrate how the initial manifestation of music intelligence in this state-of-the-art can be deceptive. Our work provides constructive directions toward developing music content analysis systems that can address the music information and creation needs of real-world users.",0
"We present and evaluate new techniques for designing algorithm portfolios. In our view, the problem has both a scheduling aspect and a machine learning aspect. Prior work has largely addressed one of the two aspects in isolation. Building on recent work on the scheduling aspect of the problem, we present a technique that addresses both aspects simultaneously and has attractive theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, we show that this technique can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms for Boolean satisfiability, zero-one integer programming, and A.I. planning.",0
"In the a posteriori approach of multiobjective optimization the Pareto front is approximated by a finite set of solutions in the objective space. The quality of the approximation can be measured by different indicators that take into account the approximation's closeness to the Pareto front and its distribution along the Pareto front. In particular, the averaged Hausdorff indicator prefers an almost uniform distribution. An observed drawback of multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MEDAs) is that - as common for randomized metaheuristics - the final population usually is not uniformly distributed along the Pareto front. Therefore, we propose a postprocessing strategy which consists of applying the averaged Hausdorff indicator to the complete archive of generated solutions after optimization in order to select a uniformly distributed subset of nondominated solutions from the archive. In this paper, we put forward a strategy for extracting the above described subset. The effectiveness of the proposal is contrasted in a series of experiments that involve different MEDAs and filtering techniques.",0
"Text normalization techniques based on rules, lexicons or supervised training requiring large corpora are not scalable nor domain interchangeable, and this makes them unsuitable for normalizing user-generated content (UGC). Current tools available for Brazilian Portuguese make use of such techniques. In this work we propose a technique based on distributed representation of words (or word embeddings). It generates continuous numeric vectors of high-dimensionality to represent words. The vectors explicitly encode many linguistic regularities and patterns, as well as syntactic and semantic word relationships. Words that share semantic similarity are represented by similar vectors. Based on these features, we present a totally unsupervised, expandable and language and domain independent method for learning normalization lexicons from word embeddings. Our approach obtains high correction rate of orthographic errors and internet slang in product reviews, outperforming the current available tools for Brazilian Portuguese.",0
"Change management for evolving collaborative business process development is crucial when the business logic, transections and workflow change due to changes in business strategies or organizational and technical environment. During the change implementation, business processes are analyzed and improved ensuring that they capture the proposed change and they do not contain any undesired functionalities or change side-effects. This paper presents Business Process Change Management approach for the efficient and effective implementation of change in the business process. The key technology behind our approach is our proposed Business Process Change Management Ontology (BPCMont) which is the main contribution of this paper. BPCMont, as a formalized change specification, helps to revert BP into a consistent state in case of system crash, intermediate conflicting stage or unauthorized change done, aid in change traceability in the new and old versions of business processes, change effects can be seen and estimated effectively, ease for Stakeholders to validate and verify change implementation, etc.",0
"Learning in Riemannian orbifolds is motivated by existing machine learning algorithms that directly operate on finite combinatorial structures such as point patterns, trees, and graphs. These methods, however, lack statistical justification. This contribution derives consistency results for learning problems in structured domains and thereby generalizes learning in vector spaces and manifolds.",0
"Stochastic simulation algorithms such as likelihood weighting often give fast, accurate approximations to posterior probabilities in probabilistic networks, and are the methods of choice for very large networks. Unfortunately, the special characteristics of dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs), which are used to represent stochastic temporal processes, mean that standard simulation algorithms perform very poorly. In essence, the simulation trials diverge further and further from reality as the process is observed over time. In this paper, we present simulation algorithms that use the evidence observed at each time step to push the set of trials back towards reality. The first algorithm, ""evidence reversal"" (ER) restructures each time slice of the DPN so that the evidence nodes for the slice become ancestors of the state variables. The second algorithm, called ""survival of the fittest"" sampling (SOF), ""repopulates"" the set of trials at each time step using a stochastic reproduction rate weighted by the likelihood of the evidence according to each trial. We compare the performance of each algorithm with likelihood weighting on the original network, and also investigate the benefits of combining the ER and SOF methods. The ER/SOF combination appears to maintain bounded error independent of the number of time steps in the simulation.",0
"Recent works have highlighted scale invariance or symmetry that is present in the weight space of a typical deep network and the adverse effect that it has on the Euclidean gradient based stochastic gradient descent optimization. In this work, we show that these and other commonly used deep networks, such as those which use a max-pooling and sub-sampling layer, possess more complex forms of symmetry arising from scaling based reparameterization of the network weights. We then propose two symmetry-invariant gradient based weight updates for stochastic gradient descent based learning. Our empirical evidence based on the MNIST dataset shows that these updates improve the test performance without sacrificing the computational efficiency of the weight updates. We also show the results of training with one of the proposed weight updates on an image segmentation problem.",0
"Managed Multi-Context Systems (mMCSs) provide a general framework for integrating knowledge represented in heterogeneous KR formalisms. However, mMCSs are essentially static as they were not designed to run in a dynamic scenario. Some recent approaches, among them evolving Multi-Context Systems (eMCSs), extend mMCSs by allowing not only the ability to integrate knowledge represented in heterogeneous KR formalisms, but at the same time to both react to, and reason in the presence of commonly temporary dynamic observations, and evolve by incorporating new knowledge. The notion of minimal change is a central notion in dynamic scenarios, specially in those that admit several possible alternative evolutions. Since eMCSs combine heterogeneous KR formalisms, each of which may require different notions of minimal change, the study of minimal change in eMCSs is an interesting and highly non-trivial problem. In this paper, we study the notion of minimal change in eMCSs, and discuss some alternative minimal change criteria.",0
"Robotic code needs to be verified to ensure its safety and functional correctness, especially when the robot is interacting with people. Testing the real code in simulation is a viable option. It reduces the costs of experiments and provides detail that is lost when using formal methods. However, generating tests that cover interesting scenarios, while executing most of the code, is a challenge amplified by the complexity of the interactions between the environment and the software. Model-based test generation methods can automate otherwise manual processes and facilitate reaching rare scenarios during testing. In this paper, we compare the use of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents as models for test generation, with more conventional, model-based test generation, that exploits automata and model checking techniques, and random test generation methods, in terms of practicality, performance, scalability, and exploration (`coverage'). Simulators and automated testbenches were implemented in Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo, for testing the code of two robots, BERT2 in a cooperative manufacture (table assembly) task, and Tiago as a home care assistant. The results highlight the clear advantages of using BDI agents for test generation, compared to random and conventional automata-based approaches. BDI agents naturally emulate the agency present in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). They are thus more expressive and scale well in HRI applications.",0
"Is it possible to make statistical inference broadly accessible to non-statisticians without sacrificing mathematical rigor or inference quality? This paper describes BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform that aims to enable users to query the probable implications of their data as directly as SQL databases enable them to query the data itself. This paper focuses on four aspects of BayesDB: (i) BQL, an SQL-like query language for Bayesian data analysis, that answers queries by averaging over an implicit space of probabilistic models; (ii) techniques for implementing BQL using a broad class of multivariate probabilistic models; (iii) a semi-parametric Bayesian model-builder that auomatically builds ensembles of factorial mixture models to serve as baselines; and (iv) MML, a ""meta-modeling"" language for imposing qualitative constraints on the model-builder and combining baseline models with custom algorithmic and statistical models that can be implemented in external software. BayesDB is illustrated using three applications: cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites; assessing the evidence for temporal dependence between macroeconomic indicators; and analyzing a salary survey.",0
"Possibility theory offers either a qualitive, or a numerical framework for representing uncertainty, in terms of dual measures of possibility and necessity. This leads to the existence of two kinds of possibilistic causal graphs where the conditioning is either based on the minimum, or the product operator. Benferhat et al. (1999) have investigated the connections between min-based graphs and possibilistic logic bases (made of classical formulas weighted in terms of certainty). This paper deals with a more difficult issue : the product-based graphical representations of possibilistic bases, which provides an easy structural reading of possibilistic bases. Moreover, this paper also provides another reading of possibilistic bases in terms of comparative preferences of the form ""in the context p, q is preferred to not q"". This enables us to explicit preferences underlying a set of goals with different levels of priority.",0
"Probabilistic modeling is one of the foundations of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel type of probabilistic models named latent dependency forest models (LDFMs). A LDFM models the dependencies between random variables with a forest structure that can change dynamically based on the variable values. It is therefore capable of modeling context-specific independence. We parameterize a LDFM using a first-order non-projective dependency grammar. Learning LDFMs from data can be formulated purely as a parameter learning problem, and hence the difficult problem of model structure learning is circumvented. Our experimental results show that LDFMs are competitive with existing probabilistic models.",1
"In this article we study the impact of the negotiation environment on the performance of several intra-team strategies (team dynamics) for agent-based negotiation teams that negotiate with an opponent. An agent-based negotiation team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental conditions.",0
"The current trends in next-generation exascale systems go towards integrating a wide range of specialized (co-)processors into traditional supercomputers. Due to the efficiency of heterogeneous systems in terms of Watts and FLOPS per surface unit, opening the access of heterogeneous platforms to a wider range of users is an important problem to be tackled. However, heterogeneous platforms limit the portability of the applications and increase development complexity due to the programming skills required. Program transformation can help make programming heterogeneous systems easier by defining a step-wise transformation process that translates a given initial code into a semantically equivalent final code, but adapted to a specific platform. Program transformation systems require the definition of efficient transformation strategies to tackle the combinatorial problem that emerges due to the large set of transformations applicable at each step of the process. In this paper we propose a machine learning-based approach to learn heuristics to define program transformation strategies. Our approach proposes a novel combination of reinforcement learning and classification methods to efficiently tackle the problems inherent to this type of systems. Preliminary results demonstrate the suitability of this approach.",0
"The ability to accurately predict and simulate human driving behavior is critical for the development of intelligent transportation systems. Traditional modeling methods have employed simple parametric models and behavioral cloning. This paper adopts a method for overcoming the problem of cascading errors inherent in prior approaches, resulting in realistic behavior that is robust to trajectory perturbations. We extend Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning to the training of recurrent policies, and we demonstrate that our model outperforms rule-based controllers and maximum likelihood models in realistic highway simulations. Our model both reproduces emergent behavior of human drivers, such as lane change rate, while maintaining realistic control over long time horizons.",0

"There is a brief description of the probabilistic causal graph model for representing, reasoning with, and learning causal structure using Bayesian networks. It is then argued that this model is closely related to how humans reason with and learn causal structure. It is shown that studies in psychology on discounting (reasoning concerning how the presence of one cause of an effect makes another cause less probable) support the hypothesis that humans reach the same judgments as algorithms for doing inference in Bayesian networks. Next, it is shown how studies by Piaget indicate that humans learn causal structure by observing the same independencies and dependencies as those used by certain algorithms for learning the structure of a Bayesian network. Based on this indication, a subjective definition of causality is forwarded. Finally, methods for further testing the accuracy of these claims are discussed.",0
"Ontology development relates to software development in that they both involve the production of formal computational knowledge. It is possible, therefore, that some of the techniques used in software engineering could also be used for ontologies; for example, in software engineering testing is a well-established process, and part of many different methodologies.",0
"Joint attention is a core, early-developing form of social interaction. It is based on our ability to discriminate the third party objects that other people are looking at. While it has been shown that people can accurately determine whether another person is looking directly at them versus away, little is known about human ability to discriminate a third person gaze directed towards objects that are further away, especially in unconstraint cases where the looker can move her head and eyes freely. In this paper we address this question by jointly exploring human psychophysics and a cognitively motivated computer vision model, which can detect the 3D direction of gaze from 2D face images. The synthesis of behavioral study and computer vision yields several interesting discoveries. (1) Human accuracy of discriminating targets 8{\deg}-10{\deg} of visual angle apart is around 40% in a free looking gaze task; (2) The ability to interpret gaze of different lookers vary dramatically; (3) This variance can be captured by the computational model; (4) Human outperforms the current model significantly. These results collectively show that the acuity of human joint attention is indeed highly impressive, given the computational challenge of the natural looking task. Moreover, the gap between human and model performance, as well as the variability of gaze interpretation across different lookers, require further understanding of the underlying mechanisms utilized by humans for this challenging task.",0
"In this paper we explore a symmetry-based search space reduction technique which can speed up optimal pathfinding on undirected uniform-cost grid maps by up to 38 times. Our technique decomposes grid maps into a set of empty rectangles, removing from each rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from along the perimeter. We then add a series of macro-edges between selected pairs of remaining perimeter nodes to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each rectangle. We also develop a novel online pruning technique to further speed up search. Our algorithm is fast, memory efficient and retains the same optimality and completeness guarantees as searching on an unmodified grid map.",0
"In this paper, we improve the previously best known regret bound to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy in oblivious adversarial bandits from $\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3}/\epsilon)}$ to $\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{T} \ln T /\epsilon)}$. This is achieved by combining a Laplace Mechanism with EXP3. We show that though EXP3 is already differentially private, it leaks a linear amount of information in $T$. However, we can improve this privacy by relying on its intrinsic exponential mechanism for selecting actions. This allows us to reach $\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{\ln T})}$-DP, with a regret of $\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3})}$ that holds against an adaptive adversary, an improvement from the best known of $\mathcal{O}{(T^{3/4})}$. This is done by using an algorithm that run EXP3 in a mini-batch loop. Finally, we run experiments that clearly demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis.",1
"The study of opinions, their formation and change, is one of the defining topics addressed by social psychology, but in recent years other disciplines, like computer science and complexity, have tried to deal with this issue. Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields, several key questions still remain unanswered. The understanding of how opinions change and the way they are affected by social influence are challenging issues requiring a thorough analysis of opinion per se but also of the way in which they travel between agents' minds and are modulated by these exchanges. To account for the two-faceted nature of opinions, which are mental entities undergoing complex social processes, we outline a preliminary model in which a cognitive theory of opinions is put forward and it is paired with a formal description of them and of their spreading among minds. Furthermore, investigating social influence also implies the necessity to account for the way in which people change their minds, as a consequence of interacting with other people, and the need to explain the higher or lower persistence of such changes.",0
"Attribute reduction is a basic issue in knowledge representation and data mining. Rough sets provide a theoretical foundation for the issue. Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids. First, a dependence space of matroids is constructed. Second, the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids. Third, we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases. Finally, the obtained results are applied to the issues of attribute reduction in information systems. In a word, this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction.",0
"We investigate the relationship between the generalization of program completion defined in 1984 by Lloyd and Topor and the generalization of the stable model semantics introduced recently by Ferraris et al. The main theorem can be used to characterize, in some cases, the general stable models of a logic program by a first-order formula. The proof uses Truszczynski's stable model semantics of infinitary propositional formulas.",0
"Robotic challenges like the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) or the DARPA Challenges are an established and important way to drive scientific progress as they make research comparable on a well-defined benchmark with equal test conditions for all participants. However, such challenge events occur only occasionally, are limited to a small number of contestants, and the test conditions are very difficult to replicate after the main event. We present a new physical benchmark challenge for robotic picking. The ACRV Picking Benchmark is designed to be reproducible by using a set of 42 common objects, a widely available shelf, and exact guidelines for object arrangement using stencils. A well-defined evaluation protocol enables the comparability of complete robotic systems -- including perception and manipulation -- instead of sub-systems only. Our paper describes this new benchmark challenge and presents results acquired by a baseline system based on a Baxter robot.",0
"The research of personalized recommendation techniques today has mostly parted into two mainstream directions, i.e., the factorization-based approaches and topic models. Practically, they aim to benefit from the numerical ratings and textual reviews, correspondingly, which compose two major information sources in various real-world systems. However, although the two approaches are supposed to be correlated for their same goal of accurate recommendation, there still lacks a clear theoretical understanding of how their objective functions can be mathematically bridged to leverage the numerical ratings and textual reviews collectively, and why such a bridge is intuitively reasonable to match up their learning procedures for the rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, respectively.",0
"We study a probability distribution d on the truth assignments to a uniform binary AND-OR tree. Liu and Tanaka [2007, Inform. Process. Lett.] showed the following: If d achieves the equilibrium among independent distributions (ID) then d is an independent identical distribution (IID). We show a stronger form of the above result. Given a real number r such that 0 &lt; r &lt; 1, we consider a constraint that the probability of the root node having the value 0 is r. Our main result is the following: When we restrict ourselves to IDs satisfying this constraint, the above result of Liu and Tanaka still holds. The proof employs clever tricks of induction. In particular, we show two fundamental relationships between expected cost and probability in an IID on an OR-AND tree: (1) The ratio of the cost and the probability (of the root having the value 0) is a decreasing function of the probability x of the leaf. (2) The ratio of derivative of the cost and the derivative of the probability is decreasing function of x, too.",0
"Classification involves the learning of the mapping function that associates input samples to corresponding target label. There are two major categories of classification problems: Single-label classification and Multi-label classification. Traditional binary and multi-class classifications are sub-categories of single-label classification. Several classifiers are developed for binary, multi-class and multi-label classification problems, but there are no classifiers available in the literature capable of performing all three types of classification. In this paper, a novel online universal classifier capable of performing all the three types of classification is proposed. Being a high speed online classifier, the proposed technique can be applied to streaming data applications. The performance of the developed classifier is evaluated using datasets from binary, multi-class and multi-label problems. The results obtained are compared with state-of-the-art techniques from each of the classification types.",0
"Binary relation extraction methods have been widely studied in recent years. However, few methods have been developed for higher n-ary relation extraction. One limiting factor is the effort required to generate training data. For binary relations, one only has to provide a few dozen pairs of entities per relation, as training data. For ternary relations (n=3), each training instance is a triplet of entities, placing a greater cognitive load on people. For example, many people know that Google acquired Youtube but not the dollar amount or the date of the acquisition and many people know that Hillary Clinton is married to Bill Clinton by not the location or date of their wedding. This makes higher n-nary training data generation a time consuming exercise in searching the Web. We present a resource for training ternary relation extractors. This was generated using a minimally supervised yet effective approach. We present statistics on the size and the quality of the dataset.",0
"Spectral inference provides fast algorithms and provable optimality for latent topic analysis. But for real data these algorithms require additional ad-hoc heuristics, and even then often produce unusable results. We explain this poor performance by casting the problem of topic inference in the framework of Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization (JSMF) and showing that previous methods violate the theoretical conditions necessary for a good solution to exist. We then propose a novel rectification method that learns high quality topics and their interactions even on small, noisy data. This method achieves results comparable to probabilistic techniques in several domains while maintaining scalability and provable optimality.",1
"This paper proposes a design of hierarchical fuzzy inference tree (HFIT). An HFIT produces an optimum treelike structure, i.e., a natural hierarchical structure that accommodates simplicity by combining several low-dimensional fuzzy inference systems (FISs). Such a natural hierarchical structure provides a high degree of approximation accuracy. The construction of HFIT takes place in two phases. Firstly, a nondominated sorting based multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) is applied to obtain a simple tree structure (a low complexity model) with a high accuracy. Secondly, the differential evolution algorithm is applied to optimize the obtained tree's parameters. In the derived tree, each node acquires a different input's combination, where the evolutionary process governs the input's combination. Hence, HFIT nodes are heterogeneous in nature, which leads to a high diversity among the rules generated by the HFIT. Additionally, the HFIT provides an automatic feature selection because it uses MOGP for the tree's structural optimization that accepts inputs only relevant to the knowledge contained in data. The HFIT was studied in the context of both type-1 and type-2 FISs, and its performance was evaluated through six application problems. Moreover, the proposed multiobjective HFIT was compared both theoretically and empirically with recently proposed FISs methods from the literature, such as McIT2FIS, TSCIT2FNN, SIT2FNN, RIT2FNS-WB, eT2FIS, MRIT2NFS, IT2FNN-SVR, etc. From the obtained results, it was found that the HFIT provided less complex and highly accurate models compared to the models produced by the most of other methods. Hence, the proposed HFIT is an efficient and competitive alternative to the other FISs for function approximation and feature selection.",0
"Declarative spatial reasoning denotes the ability to (declaratively) specify and solve real-world problems related to geometric and qualitative spatial representation and reasoning within standard knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) based methods (e.g., logic programming and derivatives). One approach for encoding the semantics of spatial relations within a declarative programming framework is by systems of polynomial constraints. However, solving such constraints is computationally intractable in general (i.e. the theory of real-closed fields).",0
"We present the third generation of the constraint answer set system clingcon, combining Answer Set Programming (ASP) with finite domain constraint processing (CP). While its predecessors rely on a black-box approach to hybrid solving by integrating the CP solver gecode, the new clingcon system pursues a lazy approach using dedicated constraint propagators to extend propagation in the underlying ASP solver clasp. No extension is needed for parsing and grounding clingcon's hybrid modeling language since both can be accommodated by the new generic theory handling capabilities of the ASP grounder gringo. As a whole, clingcon 3 is thus an extension of the ASP system clingo 5, which itself relies on the grounder gringo and the solver clasp. The new approach of clingcon offers a seamless integration of CP propagation into ASP solving that benefits from the whole spectrum of clasp's reasoning modes, including for instance multi-shot solving and advanced optimization techniques. This is accomplished by a lazy approach that unfolds the representation of constraints and adds it to that of the logic program only when needed. Although the unfolding is usually dictated by the constraint propagators during solving, it can already be partially (or even totally) done during preprocessing. Moreover, clingcon's constraint preprocessing and propagation incorporate several well established CP techniques that greatly improve its performance. We demonstrate this via an extensive empirical evaluation contrasting, first, the various techniques in the context of CSP solving and, second, the new clingcon system with other hybrid ASP systems. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)",0
"An important capability of autonomous multi-robot systems is to prevent collision among the individual robots. One approach to this problem is to plan conflict-free trajectories and let each of the robots follow its pre-planned trajectory. A widely used practical method for multi-robot trajectory planning is prioritized planning, which has been shown to be effective in practice, but is in general incomplete. Formal analysis of instances that are provably solvable by prioritized planning is still missing. Moreover, prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm, which may be in many situations undesirable.",0
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated to successfully approximate complex data distributions. A relevant extension of this model is conditional GANs (cGANs), where the introduction of external information allows to determine specific representations of the generated images. In this work, we evaluate encoders to inverse the mapping of a cGAN, i.e., mapping a real image into a latent space and a conditional representation. This allows, for example, to reconstruct and modify real images of faces conditioning on arbitrary attributes. Additionally, we evaluate the design of cGANs. The combination of an encoder with a cGAN, which we call Invertible cGAN (IcGAN), enables to re-generate real images with deterministic complex modifications.",0
"The margin of victory is easy to compute for many election schemes but difficult for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV). This is important because arguments about the correctness of an election outcome usually rely on the size of the electoral margin. For example, risk-limiting audits require a knowledge of the margin of victory in order to determine how much auditing is necessary. This paper presents a practical branch-and-bound algorithm for exact IRV margin computation that substantially improves on the current best-known approach. Although exponential in the worst case, our algorithm runs efficiently in practice on all the real examples we could find. We can efficiently discover exact margins on election instances that cannot be solved by the current state-of-the-art.",0

"This paper describes an architecture that combines the complementary strengths of declarative programming and probabilistic graphical models to enable robots to represent, reason with, and learn from, qualitative and quantitative descriptions of uncertainty and knowledge. An action language is used for the low-level (LL) and high-level (HL) system descriptions in the architecture, and the definition of recorded histories in the HL is expanded to allow prioritized defaults. For any given goal, tentative plans created in the HL using default knowledge and commonsense reasoning are implemented in the LL using probabilistic algorithms, with the corresponding observations used to update the HL history. Tight coupling between the two levels enables automatic selection of relevant variables and generation of suitable action policies in the LL for each HL action, and supports reasoning with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions in large and complex domains. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on physical robots transporting objects in indoor domains; the benefit on robots is a reduction in task execution time of 39% compared with a purely probabilistic, but still hierarchical, approach.",0
"Markov Networks are widely used through out computer vision and machine learning. An important subclass are the Associative Markov Networks which are used in a wide variety of applications. For these networks a good approximate minimum cost solution can be found efficiently using graph cut based move making algorithms such as alpha-expansion. Recently a related model has been proposed, the associative hierarchical network, which provides a natural generalisation of the Associative Markov Network for higher order cliques (i.e. clique size greater than two). This method provides a good model for object class segmentation problem in computer vision. Within this paper we briefly describe the associative hierarchical network and provide a computationally efficient method for approximate inference based on graph cuts. Our method performs well for networks containing hundreds of thousand of variables, and higher order potentials are defined over cliques containing tens of thousands of variables. Due to the size of these problems standard linear programming techniques are inapplicable. We show that our method has a bound of 4 for the solution of general associative hierarchical network with arbitrary clique size noting that few results on bounds exist for the solution of labelling of Markov Networks with higher order cliques.",0
"Diffusions and related random walk procedures are of central importance in many areas of machine learning, data analysis, and applied mathematics. Because they spread mass agnostically at each step in an iterative manner, they can sometimes spread mass ""too aggressively,"" thereby failing to find the ""right"" clusters. We introduce a novel Capacity Releasing Diffusion (CRD) Process, which is both faster and stays more local than the classical spectral diffusion process. As an application, we use our CRD Process to develop an improved local algorithm for graph clustering. Our local graph clustering method can find local clusters in a model of clustering where one begins the CRD Process in a cluster whose vertices are connected better internally than externally by an $O(\log^2 n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the cluster. Thus, our CRD Process is the first local graph clustering algorithm that is not subject to the well-known quadratic Cheeger barrier. Our result requires a certain smoothness condition, which we expect to be an artifact of our analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates improved results, in particular for realistic social graphs where there are moderately good---but not very good---clusters.",1
"In this paper we deal with a new approach to probabilistic reasoning in a logical framework. Nearly almost all logics of probability that have been proposed in the literature are based on classical two-valued logic. After making clear the differences between fuzzy logic and probability theory, here we propose a {em fuzzy} logic of probability for which completeness results (in a probabilistic sense) are provided. The main idea behind this approach is that probability values of crisp propositions can be understood as truth-values of some suitable fuzzy propositions associated to the crisp ones. Moreover, suggestions and examples of how to extend the formalism to cope with conditional probabilities and with other uncertainty formalisms are also provided.",0
"Methods for learning word representations using large text corpora have received much attention lately due to their impressive performance in numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as, semantic similarity measurement, and word analogy detection. Despite their success, these data-driven word representation learning methods do not consider the rich semantic relational structure between words in a co-occurring context. On the other hand, already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semantic lexicons such as the WordNet that represent the meanings of words by defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language. We consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating the knowledge from semantic lexicons?. For this purpose, we propose a joint word representation learning method that simultaneously predicts the co-occurrences of two words in a sentence subject to the relational constrains given by the semantic lexicon. We use relations that exist between words in the lexicon to regularize the word representations learnt from the corpus. Our proposed method statistically significantly outperforms previously proposed methods for incorporating semantic lexicons into word representations on several benchmark datasets for semantic similarity and word analogy.",1
"The idea of fully accepting statements when the evidence has rendered them probable enough faces a number of difficulties. We leave the interpretation of probability largely open, but attempt to suggest a contextual approach to full belief. We show that the difficulties of probabilistic acceptance are not as severe as they are sometimes painted, and that though there are oddities associated with probabilistic acceptance they are in some instances less awkward than the difficulties associated with other nonmonotonic formalisms. We show that the structure at which we arrive provides a natural home for statistical inference.",0
"This paper is aimed at providing a very first, more ""global"", systematic point of view with respect to possible conflict generation in CA-EN-like causal structures. For simplicity, only the outermost level of graphs is taken into account. Localization of the ""conflict area"", diagnostic preferences, and bases for systematic conflict generation are considered. A notion of {\em Potential Conflict Structure} ({\em PCS}) constituting a basic tool for identification of possible conflicts is proposed and its use is discussed.",0
"Recent research on the Symbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) algorithm[2] has focused attention on the importance of resolving general queries in Bayesian networks. SPI applies the concept of dependency-directed backward search to probabilistic inference, and is incremental with respect to both queries and observations. In response to this research we have extended the evidence potential algorithm [3] with the same features. We call the extension symbolic evidence potential inference (SEPI). SEPI like SPI can handle generic queries and is incremental with respect to queries and observations. While in SPI, operations are done on a search tree constructed from the nodes of the original network, in SEPI, a clique-tree structure obtained from the evidence potential algorithm [3] is the basic framework for recursive query processing. In this paper, we describe the systematic query and caching procedure of SEPI. SEPI begins with finding a clique tree from a Bayesian network-the standard procedure of the evidence potential algorithm. With the clique tree, various probability distributions are computed and stored in each clique. This is the ?pre-processing? step of SEPI. Once this step is done, the query can then be computed. To process a query, a recursive process similar to the SPI algorithm is used. The queries are directed to the root clique and decomposed into queries for the clique's subtrees until a particular query can be answered at the clique at which it is directed. The algorithm and the computation are simple. The SEPI algorithm will be presented in this paper along with several examples.",0
"Interpolation is an important property of classical and many non-classical logics that has been shown to have interesting applications in computer science and AI. Here we study the Interpolation Property for the the non-monotonic system of equilibrium logic, establishing weaker or stronger forms of interpolation depending on the precise interpretation of the inference relation. These results also yield a form of interpolation for ground logic programs under the answer sets semantics. For disjunctive logic programs we also study the property of uniform interpolation that is closely related to the concept of variable forgetting. The first-order version of equilibrium logic has analogous Interpolation properties whenever the collection of equilibrium models is (first-order) definable. Since this is the case for so-called safe programs and theories, it applies to the usual situations that arise in practical answer set programming.",0
"SelectScript is an extendable, adaptable, and declarative domain-specific language aimed at information retrieval from simulation environments and robotic world models in an SQL-like manner. In this work we have extended the language in two directions. First, we have implemented hierarchical queries; second, we improve efficiency enabling manual design space exploration on different ""search"" strategies. As depicted in the teaser above, we demonstrate the applicability of such extensions in two application problems; the basic language concepts are explained by solving the classical problem of the Towers of Hanoi and then a common path planning problem in a complex 3D environment is implemented.",0
"Lightweight, source-to-source transformation approaches to implementing MCMC for probabilistic programming languages are popular for their simplicity, support of existing deterministic code, and ability to execute on existing fast runtimes. However, they are also slow, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls. We show that on several common models, C3 reduces proposal runtime by 20-100x, in some cases reducing runtime complexity from linear in model size to constant. We also demonstrate nearly an order of magnitude speedup on a complex inverse procedural modeling application.",0
"Adjustable autonomy refers to entities dynamically varying their own autonomy, transferring decision-making control to other entities (typically agents transferring control to human users) in key situations. Determining whether and when such transfers-of-control should occur is arguably the fundamental research problem in adjustable autonomy. Previous work has investigated various approaches to addressing this problem but has often focused on individual agent-human interactions. Unfortunately, domains requiring collaboration between teams of agents and humans reveal two key shortcomings of these previous approaches. First, these approaches use rigid one-shot transfers of control that can result in unacceptable coordination failures in multiagent settings. Second, they ignore costs (e.g., in terms of time delays or effects on actions) to an agent's team due to such transfers-of-control. To remedy these problems, this article presents a novel approach to adjustable autonomy, based on the notion of a transfer-of-control strategy. A transfer-of-control strategy consists of a conditional sequence of two types of actions: (i) actions to transfer decision-making control (e.g., from an agent to a user or vice versa) and (ii) actions to change an agent's pre-specified coordination constraints with team members, aimed at minimizing miscoordination costs. The goal is for high-quality individual decisions to be made with minimal disruption to the coordination of the team. We present a mathematical model of transfer-of-control strategies. The model guides and informs the operationalization of the strategies using Markov Decision Processes, which select an optimal strategy, given an uncertain environment and costs to the individuals and teams. The approach has been carefully evaluated, including via its use in a real-world, deployed multi-agent system that assists a research group in its daily activities.",0
"As Bayesian networks are applied to larger and more complex problem domains, search for flexible modeling and more efficient inference methods is an ongoing effort. Multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) extend the HUGIN inference for Bayesian networks into a coherent framework for flexible modeling and distributed inference.Lazy propagation extends the Shafer-Shenoy and HUGIN inference methods with reduced space complexity. We apply the Shafer-Shenoy and lazy propagation to inference in MSBNs. The combination of the MSBN framework and lazy propagation provides a better framework for modeling and inference in very large domains. It retains the modeling flexibility of MSBNs and reduces the runtime space complexity, allowing exact inference in much larger domains given the same computational resources.",0
"These notes describe how the ""SP theory of intelligence"", and its embodiment in the ""SP machine"", may help to realise cognitive computing, as described in the book ""Smart Machines"". In the SP system, information compression and a concept of ""multiple alignment"" are centre stage. The system is designed to integrate such things as unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, probabilistic reasoning, and more. It may help to overcome the problem of variety in big data, it may serve in pattern recognition and in the unsupervised learning of structure in data, and it may facilitate the management and transmission of big data. There is potential, via information compression, for substantial gains in computational efficiency, especially in the use of energy. The SP system may help to realise data-centric computing, perhaps via a development of Hebb's concept of a ""cell assembly"", or via the use of light or DNA for the processing of information. It has potential in the management of errors and uncertainty in data, in medical diagnosis, in processing streams of data, and in promoting adaptability in robots.",0
"This is a preliminary report on the work aimed at making CR-Prolog -- a version of ASP with consistency restoring rules -- more suitable for use in teaching and large applications. First we describe a sorted version of CR-Prolog called SPARC. Second, we translate a basic version of the CR-Prolog into the language of DLV and compare the performance with the state of the art CR-Prolog solver. The results form the foundation for future more efficient and user friendly implementation of SPARC and shed some light on the relationship between two useful knowledge representation constructs: consistency restoring rules and weak constraints of DLV.",0
"We present PULCinella and its use in comparing uncertainty theories. PULCinella is a general tool for Propagating Uncertainty based on the Local Computation technique of Shafer and Shenoy. It may be specialized to different uncertainty theories: at the moment, Pulcinella can propagate probabilities, belief functions, Boolean values, and possibilities. Moreover, Pulcinella allows the user to easily define his own specializations. To illustrate Pulcinella, we analyze two examples by using each of the four theories above. In the first one, we mainly focus on intrinsic differences between theories. In the second one, we take a knowledge engineer viewpoint, and check the adequacy of each theory to a given problem.",0
"In this work, we present asynchronous multi-context systems (aMCSs), which provide a framework for loosely coupling different knowledge representation formalisms that allows for online reasoning in a dynamic environment. Systems of this kind may interact with the outside world via input and output streams and may therefore react to a continuous flow of external information. In contrast to recent proposals, contexts in an aMCS communicate with each other in an asynchronous way which fits the needs of many application domains and is beneficial for scalability. The federal semantics of aMCSs renders our framework an integration approach rather than a knowledge representation formalism itself. We illustrate the introduced concepts by means of an example scenario dealing with rescue services. In addition, we compare aMCSs to reactive multi-context systems and describe how to simulate the latter with our novel approach.",0
"This paper presents an approach for transforming data granularity in hierarchical databases for binary decision problems by applying regression to categorical attributes at the lower grain levels. Attributes from a lower hierarchy entity in the relational database have their information content optimized through regression on the categories histogram trained on a small exclusive labelled sample, instead of the usual mode category of the distribution. The paper validates the approach on a binary decision task for assessing the quality of secondary schools focusing on how logistic regression transforms the students and teachers attributes into school attributes. Experiments were carried out on Brazilian schools public datasets via 10-fold cross-validation comparison of the ranking score produced also by logistic regression. The proposed approach achieved higher performance than the usual distribution mode transformation and equal to the expert weighing approach measured by the maximum Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and the area under the ROC curve at 0.01 significance level.",0
"With the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), various organizations and individuals started debating about the progress of AI as a blessing or a curse for the future of the society. This paper conducts an investigation on how the public perceives the progress of AI by utilizing the data shared on Twitter. Specifically, this paper performs a comparative analysis on the understanding of users from two categories -- general AI-Tweeters (AIT) and the expert AI-Tweeters (EAIT) who share posts about AI on Twitter. Our analysis revealed that users from both the categories express distinct emotions and interests towards AI. Users from both the categories regard AI as positive and are optimistic about the progress of AI but the experts are more negative than the general AI-Tweeters. Characterization of users manifested that `London' is the popular location of users from where they tweet about AI.

While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g. voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However, this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive.",1
"In this paper, we propose a new approach for recommender systems based on target tracking by Kalman filtering. We assume that users and their seen resources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the resources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter to track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in the recommendation space.",0
"Many popular knowledge graphs such as Freebase, YAGO or DBPedia maintain a list of non-discrete attributes for each entity. Intuitively, these attributes such as height, price or population count are able to richly characterize entities in knowledge graphs. This additional source of information may help to alleviate the inherent sparsity and incompleteness problem that are prevalent in knowledge graphs. Unfortunately, many state-of-the-art relational learning models ignore this information due to the challenging nature of dealing with non-discrete data types in the inherently binary-natured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for both encoding and prediction of non-discrete attribute information in a relational setting. Specifically, we train a neural network for triplet prediction along with a separate network for attribute value regression. Via multi-task learning, we are able to learn representations of entities, relations and attributes that encode information about both tasks. Moreover, such attributes are not only central to many predictive tasks as an information source but also as a prediction target. Therefore, models that are able to encode, incorporate and predict such information in a relational learning context are highly attractive as well. We show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods for the tasks of relational triplet classification and attribute value prediction.",0
"Many intelligent user interfaces employ application and user models to determine the user's preferences, goals and likely future actions. Such models require application analysis, adaptation and expansion. Building and maintaining such models adds a substantial amount of time and labour to the application development cycle. We present a system that observes the interface of an unmodified application and records users' interactions with the application. From a history of such observations we build a coarse state space of observed interface states and actions between them. To refine the space, we hypothesize sub-states based upon the histories that led users to a given state. We evaluate the information gain of possible state splits, varying the length of the histories considered in such splits. In this way, we automatically produce a stochastic dynamic model of the application and of how it is used. To evaluate our approach, we present models derived from real-world application usage data.",0
"The study of representations invariant to common transformations of the data is important to learning. Most techniques have focused on local approximate invariance implemented within expensive optimization frameworks lacking explicit theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study kernels that are invariant to the unitary group while having theoretical guarantees in addressing practical issues such as (1) unavailability of transformed versions of labelled data and (2) not observing all transformations. We present a theoretically motivated alternate approach to the invariant kernel SVM. Unlike previous approaches to the invariant SVM, the proposed formulation solves both issues mentioned. We also present a kernel extension of a recent technique to extract linear unitary-group invariant features addressing both issues and extend some guarantees regarding invariance and stability. We present experiments on the UCI ML datasets to illustrate and validate our methods.",0
"Decentralized control of cooperative systems captures the operation of a group of decision makers that share a single global objective. The difficulty in solving optimally such problems arises when the agents lack full observability of the global state of the system when they operate. The general problem has been shown to be NEXP-complete. In this paper, we identify classes of decentralized control problems whose complexity ranges between NEXP and P. In particular, we study problems characterized by independent transitions, independent observations, and goal-oriented objective functions. Two algorithms are shown to solve optimally useful classes of goal-oriented decentralized processes in polynomial time. This paper also studies information sharing among the decision-makers, which can improve their performance. We distinguish between three ways in which agents can exchange information: indirect communication, direct communication and sharing state features that are not controlled by the agents. Our analysis shows that for every class of problems we consider, introducing direct or indirect communication does not change the worst-case complexity. The results provide a better understanding of the complexity of decentralized control problems that arise in practice and facilitate the development of planning algorithms for these problems.",0
Decision support systems help decision makers make better decisions in the face of complex decision problems (e.g. investment or policy decisions). Fisheries and Aquaculture is a domain where decision makers face such decisions since they involve factors from many different scientific fields. No systematic overview of literature describing decision support systems and their application in fisheries and aquaculture has been conducted. This paper summarizes scientific literature that describes decision support systems applied to the domain of Fisheries and Aquaculture. We use an established systematic mapping survey method to conduct our literature mapping. Our research questions are: What decision support systems for fisheries and aquaculture exists? What are the most investigated fishery and aquaculture decision support systems topics and how have these changed over time? Do any current DSS for fisheries provide real- time analytics? Do DSSes in Fisheries and Aquaculture build their models using machine learning done on captured and grounded data? The paper then detail how we employ the systematic mapping method in answering these questions. This results in 27 papers being identified as relevant and gives an exposition on the primary methods concluded in the study for designing a decision support system. We provide an analysis of the research done in the studies collected. We discovered that most literature does not consider multiple aspects for multiple stakeholders in their work. In addition we observed that little or no work has been done with real-time analysis in these decision support systems.,0
"In process mining, precision measures are used to quantify how much a process model overapproximates the behavior seen in an event log. Although several measures have been proposed throughout the years, no research has been done to validate whether these measures achieve the intended aim of quantifying over-approximation in a consistent way for all models and logs. This paper fills this gap by postulating a number of axioms for quantifying precision consistently for any log and any model. Further, we show through counter-examples that none of the existing measures consistently quantifies precision.",0
"Unsupervised learning of low-dimensional, semantic representations of words and entities has recently gained attention. In this paper we describe the Semantic Entity Retrieval Toolkit (SERT) that provides implementations of our previously published entity representation models. The toolkit provides a unified interface to different representation learning algorithms, fine-grained parsing configuration and can be used transparently with GPUs. In addition, users can easily modify existing models or implement their own models in the framework. After model training, SERT can be used to rank entities according to a textual query and extract the learned entity/word representation for use in downstream algorithms, such as clustering or recommendation.",0
"In practice, training language models for individual authors is often expensive because of limited data resources. In such cases, Neural Network Language Models (NNLMs), generally outperform the traditional non-parametric N-gram models. Here we investigate the performance of a feed-forward NNLM on an authorship attribution problem, with moderate author set size and relatively limited data. We also consider how the text topics impact performance. Compared with a well-constructed N-gram baseline method with Kneser-Ney smoothing, the proposed method achieves nearly 2:5% reduction in perplexity and increases author classification accuracy by 3:43% on average, given as few as 5 test sentences. The performance is very competitive with the state of the art in terms of accuracy and demand on test data. The source code, preprocessed datasets, a detailed description of the methodology and results are available at",1

"A goal of cloud service management is to design self-adaptable auto-scaler to react to workload fluctuations and changing the resources assigned. The key problem is how and when to add/remove resources in order to meet agreed service-level agreements. Reducing application cost and guaranteeing service-level agreements (SLAs) are two critical factors of dynamic controller design. In this paper, we compare two dynamic learning strategies based on a fuzzy logic system, which learns and modifies fuzzy scaling rules at runtime. A self-adaptive fuzzy logic controller is combined with two reinforcement learning (RL) approaches: (i) Fuzzy SARSA learning (FSL) and (ii) Fuzzy Q-learning (FQL). As an off-policy approach, Q-learning learns independent of the policy currently followed, whereas SARSA as an on-policy always incorporates the actual agent's behavior and leads to faster learning. Both approaches are implemented and compared in their advantages and disadvantages, here in the OpenStack cloud platform. We demonstrate that both auto-scaling approaches can handle various load traffic situations, sudden and periodic, and delivering resources on demand while reducing operating costs and preventing SLA violations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSL and FQL have acceptable performance in terms of adjusted number of virtual machine targeted to optimize SLA compliance and response time.",0
First this report presents a restricted set of finite transducers used to synthesise structural time-series constraints described by means of a multi-layered function composition scheme.

"Most fuzzy systems including fuzzy decision support and fuzzy control systems provide out-puts in the form of fuzzy sets that represent the inferred conclusions. Linguistic interpretation of such outputs often involves the use of linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set based on the predefined primary terms, linguistic modifiers and linguistic connectives. More generally, linguistic approximation can be formalized in the terms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in ex-plicitation (e.g. simple, modifier, composite, quantification and qualification rules) in com-puting with words [Zadeh 1996]. However most existing methods of linguistic approximation use the simple, modifier and composite re-translation rules only. Although these methods can provide a sufficient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approximation of more complex ones that are typical in many practical applications of fuzzy systems may be less satisfactory. Therefore the question arises why not use in linguistic ap-proximation also other re-translation rules corre-sponding to the translation rules in explicitation to advantage. In particular linguistic quantifica-tion may be desirable in situations where the conclusions interpreted as quantified linguistic propositions can be more informative and natu-ral. This paper presents some aspects of linguis-tic approximation in the context of the re-translation rules and proposes an approach to linguistic approximation with the use of quantifi-cation rules, i.e. quantified linguistic approxima-tion. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation are considered with the use of lin-guistic quantifiers based on the concepts of the non-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach.",0
"In this paper we present a novel genetic algorithm (GA) solution to a simple yet challenging commercial puzzle game known as the Zen Puzzle Garden (ZPG). We describe the game in detail, before presenting a suitable encoding scheme and fitness function for candidate solutions. We then compare the performance of the genetic algorithm with that of the A* algorithm. Our results show that the GA is competitive with informed search in terms of solution quality, and significantly out-performs it in terms of computational resource requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for game solving and other ""real world"" problems.",0
"Digital games have become a key player in the entertainment industry, attracting millions of new players each year. In spite of that, novice players may have a hard time when playing certain types of games, such as MOBAs and MMORPGs, due to their steep learning curves and not so friendly online communities. In this paper, we present an approach to help novice players in MOBA games overcome these problems. An artificial intelligence agent plays alongside the player analyzing his/her performance and giving tips about the game. Experiments performed with the game {\em League of Legends} show the potential of this approach.",0
"Event sequence, asynchronously generated with random timestamp, is ubiquitous among applications. The precise and arbitrary timestamp can carry important clues about the underlying dynamics, and has lent the event data fundamentally different from the time-series whereby series is indexed with fixed and equal time interval. One expressive mathematical tool for modeling event is point process. The intensity functions of many point processes involve two components: the background and the effect by the history. Due to its inherent spontaneousness, the background can be treated as a time series while the other need to handle the history events. In this paper, we model the background by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with its units aligned with time series indexes while the history effect is modeled by another RNN whose units are aligned with asynchronous events to capture the long-range dynamics. The whole model with event type and timestamp prediction output layers can be trained end-to-end. Our approach takes an RNN perspective to point process, and models its background and history effect. For utility, our method allows a black-box treatment for modeling the intensity which is often a pre-defined parametric form in point processes. Meanwhile end-to-end training opens the venue for reusing existing rich techniques in deep network for point process modeling. We apply our model to the predictive maintenance problem using a log dataset by more than 1000 ATMs from a global bank headquartered in North America.",1
"While artificial intelligence (AI) has become widespread, many commercial AI systems are not yet accessible to individual researchers nor the general public due to the deep knowledge of the systems required to use them. We believe that AI has matured to the point where it should be an accessible technology for everyone. We present an ongoing project whose ultimate goal is to deliver an open source, user-friendly AI system that is specialized for machine learning analysis of complex data in the biomedical and health care domains. We discuss how genetic programming can aid in this endeavor, and highlight specific examples where genetic programming has automated machine learning analyses in previous projects.",0
"This paper deals with the representation and solution of asymmetric Bayesian decision problems. We present a formal framework, termed asymmetric influence diagrams, that is based on the influence diagram and allows an efficient representation of asymmetric decision problems. As opposed to existing frameworks, the asymmetric influece diagram primarily encodes asymmetry at the qualitative level and it can therefore be read directly from the model. We give an algorithm for solving asymmetric influence diagrams. The algorithm initially decomposes the asymmetric decision problem into a structure of symmetric subproblems organized as a tree. A solution to the decision problem can then be found by propagating from the leaves toward the root using existing evaluation methods to solve the sub-problems.",0
"When a planner must decide whether it has enough evidence to make a decision based on probability, it faces the sample size problem. Current planners using probabilities need not deal with this problem because they do not generate their probabilities from observations. This paper presents an event based language in which the planner's probabilities are calculated from the binomial random variable generated by the observed ratio of one type of event to another. Such probabilities are subject to error, so the planner must introspect about their validity. Inferences about the probability of these events can be made using statistics. Inferences about the validity of the approximations can be made using interval estimation. Interval estimation allows the planner to avoid making choices that are only weakly supported by the planner's evidence.",0
"We present a method for using standard techniques from satisfiability checking to automatically verify and discover theorems in an area of economic theory known as ranking sets of objects. The key question in this area, which has important applications in social choice theory and decision making under uncertainty, is how to extend an agents preferences over a number of objects to a preference relation over nonempty sets of such objects. Certain combinations of seemingly natural principles for this kind of preference extension can result in logical inconsistencies, which has led to a number of important impossibility theorems. We first prove a general result that shows that for a wide range of such principles, characterised by their syntactic form when expressed in a many-sorted first-order logic, any impossibility exhibited at a fixed (small) domain size will necessarily extend to the general case. We then show how to formulate candidates for impossibility theorems at a fixed domain size in propositional logic, which in turn enables us to automatically search for (general) impossibility theorems using a SAT solver. When applied to a space of 20 principles for preference extension familiar from the literature, this method yields a total of 84 impossibility theorems, including both known and nontrivial new results.",0
"Probabilistic sampling methods have become very popular to solve single-shot path planning problems. Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in particular have been shown to be efficient in solving high dimensional problems. Even though several RRT variants have been proposed for dynamic replanning, these methods only perform well in environments with infrequent changes. This paper addresses the dynamic path planning problem by combining simple techniques in a multi-stage probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm uses RRTs for initial planning and informed local search for navigation. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to highly dynamic environments than the RRT extensions.",0
"We present a new method to propagate lower bounds on conditional probability distributions in conventional Bayesian networks. Our method guarantees to provide outer approximations of the exact lower bounds. A key advantage is that we can use any available algorithms and tools for Bayesian networks in order to represent and infer lower bounds. This new method yields results that are provable exact for trees with binary variables, and results which are competitive to existing approximations in credal networks for all other network structures. Our method is not limited to a specific kind of network structure. Basically, it is also not restricted to a specific kind of inference, but we restrict our analysis to prognostic inference in this article. The computational complexity is superior to that of other existing approaches.",0
"This note presents modal versions of resource-conscious logics. We concentrate on extensions of variants of Linear Logic with one minimal non-normal modality. In earlier work, where we investigated agency in multi-agent systems, we have shown that the results scale up to logics with multiple non-minimal modalities. Here, we start with the language of propositional intuitionistic Linear Logic without the additive disjunction, to which we add a modality. We provide an interpretation of this language on a class of Kripke resource models extended with a neighbourhood function: modal Kripke resource models. We propose a Hilbert-style axiomatization and a Gentzen-style sequent calculus. We show that the proof theories are sound and complete with respect to the class of modal Kripke resource models. We show that the sequent calculus allows cut elimination and that proof-search is in PSPACE. We then show how to extend the results when non-commutative connectives are added to the language. Finally, we put the logical framework to use by instantiating it as logics of agency. In particular, we propose a logic to reason about the resource-sensitive use of artefacts and illustrate it with a variety of examples.",0
"Trajectory Prediction of dynamic objects is a widely studied topic in the field of artificial intelligence. Thanks to a large number of applications like predicting abnormal events, navigation system for the blind, etc. there have been many approaches to attempt learning patterns of motion directly from data using a wide variety of techniques ranging from hand-crafted features to sophisticated deep learning models for unsupervised feature learning. All these approaches have been limited by problems like inefficient features in the case of hand crafted features, large error propagation across the predicted trajectory and no information of static artefacts around the dynamic moving objects. We propose an end to end deep learning model to learn the motion patterns of humans using different navigational modes directly from data using the much popular sequence to sequence model coupled with a soft attention mechanism. We also propose a novel approach to model the static artefacts in a scene and using these to predict the dynamic trajectories. The proposed method, tested on trajectories of pedestrians, consistently outperforms previously proposed state of the art approaches on a variety of large scale data sets. We also show how our architecture can be naturally extended to handle multiple modes of movement (say pedestrians, skaters, bikers and buses) simultaneously.",0
"We consider how to use the Bellman residual of the dynamic programming operator to compute suboptimality bounds for solutions to stochastic shortest path problems. Such bounds have been previously established only in the special case that ""all policies are proper,"" in which case the dynamic programming operator is known to be a contraction, and have been shown to be easily computable only in the more limited special case of discounting. Under the condition that transition costs are positive, we show that suboptimality bounds can be easily computed even when not all policies are proper. In the general case when there are no restrictions on transition costs, the analysis is more complex. But we present preliminary results that show such bounds are possible.",0
"The belief network is a well-known graphical structure for representing independences in a joint probability distribution. The methods, which perform probabilistic inference in belief networks, often treat the conditional probabilities which are stored in the network as certain values. However, if one takes either a subjectivistic or a limiting frequency approach to probability, one can never be certain of probability values. An algorithm should not only be capable of reporting the probabilities of the alternatives of remaining nodes when other nodes are instantiated; it should also be capable of reporting the uncertainty in these probabilities relative to the uncertainty in the probabilities which are stored in the network. In this paper a method for determining the variances in inferred probabilities is obtained under the assumption that a posterior distribution on the uncertainty variables can be approximated by the prior distribution. It is shown that this assumption is plausible if their is a reasonable amount of confidence in the probabilities which are stored in the network. Furthermore in this paper, a surprising upper bound for the prior variances in the probabilities of the alternatives of all nodes is obtained in the case where the probability distributions of the probabilities of the alternatives are beta distributions. It is shown that the prior variance in the probability at an alternative of a node is bounded above by the largest variance in an element of the conditional probability distribution for that node.",0
"Subjective questions such as `does neymar dive', or `is clinton lying', or `is trump a fascist', are popular queries to web search engines, as can be seen by autocompletion suggestions on Google, Yahoo and Bing. In the era of cognitive computing, beyond search, they could be handled as hypotheses issued for evaluation. Our vision is to leverage on unstructured data and metadata of the rich user-generated multimedia that is often shared as material evidence in favor or against hypotheses in social media platforms. In this paper we present two preliminary experiments along those lines and discuss challenges for a cognitive computing system that collects material evidence from user-generated multimedia towards aggregating it into some form of collective decision on the hypothesis.",0
"Potential games and decentralised partially observable MDPs (Dec-POMDPs) are two commonly used models of multi-agent interaction, for static optimisation and sequential decisionmaking settings, respectively. In this paper we introduce filtered fictitious play for solving repeated potential games in which each player's observations of others' actions are perturbed by random noise, and use this algorithm to construct an online learning method for solving Dec-POMDPs. Specifically, we prove that noise in observations prevents standard fictitious play from converging to Nash equilibrium in potential games, which also makes fictitious play impractical for solving Dec-POMDPs. To combat this, we derive filtered fictitious play, and provide conditions under which it converges to a Nash equilibrium in potential games with noisy observations. We then use filtered fictitious play to construct a solver for Dec-POMDPs, and demonstrate our new algorithm's performance in a box pushing problem. Our results show that we consistently outperform the state-of-the-art Dec-POMDP solver by an average of 100% across the range of noise in the observation function.",0
"We study a generic program to investigate the scope for automatically customising it for a vital current task, which was not considered when it was first written.

"In a Human-Computer Interaction context, we aim to elaborate an adaptive and generic interaction model in two different use cases: Embodied Conversational Agents and Creative Musical Agents for musical improvisation. To reach this goal, we'll try to use the concepts of adaptation and synchronization to enhance the interactive abilities of our agents and guide the development of our interaction model, and will try to make synchrony emerge from non-verbal dimensions of interaction.",0
"We propose a general framework called Network Dissection for quantifying the interpretability of latent representations of CNNs by evaluating the alignment between individual hidden units and a set of semantic concepts. Given any CNN model, the proposed method draws on a broad data set of visual concepts to score the semantics of hidden units at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with semantics are given labels across a range of objects, parts, scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed method to test the hypothesis that interpretability of units is equivalent to random linear combinations of units, then we apply our method to compare the latent representations of various networks when trained to solve different supervised and self-supervised training tasks. We further analyze the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained with different initializations, examine the impact of network depth and width, and measure the effect of dropout and batch normalization on the interpretability of deep visual representations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power.",0
"High-Throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis, measurement, and characterization of many different but structurally-related materials. A key problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification problem, involves the determination of the crystal phase diagram from the materials' composition and structural characterization data. We present Phase-Mapper, a novel AI platform to solve the phase map identification problem that allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AI algorithms, including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain or initialize solutions. Phase-Mapper affords incorporation of any spectral demixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on a convolutive non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. AgileFD can incorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well as human feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposed methods in a large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems, demonstrating the efficacy of imposing physical constrains using AgileFD. Phase-Mapper has also been used by materials scientists to solve a wide variety of phase diagrams, including the previously unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system, which is provided here as an illustrative example.",1
"Crisis management is a complex problem raised by the scientific community currently. Decision support systems are a suitable solution for such issues, they are indeed able to help emergency managers to prevent and to manage crisis in emergency situations. However, they should be enough flexible and adaptive in order to be reliable to solve complex problems that are plunged in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The approach we propose in this paper addresses this challenge. We expose here a modelling of information for an emergency environment and an architecture of a multiagent decision support system that deals with these information in order to prevent and to manage the occur of a crisis in emergency situations. We focus on the first level of the system mechanism which intends to perceive and to reflect the evolution of the current situation. The general approach and experimentations are provided here.",0
"Warehouse is one of the important aspects of a company. Therefore, it is necessary to improve Warehouse Management System (WMS) to have a simple function that can determine the layout of the storage goods. In this paper we propose an improved warehouse layout method based on ant colony algorithm and backtracking algorithm. The method works on two steps. First, it generates a solutions parameter tree from backtracking algorithm. Then second, it deducts the solutions parameter by using a combination of ant colony algorithm and backtracking algorithm. This method was tested by measuring the time needed to build the tree and to fill up the space using two scenarios. The method needs 0.294 to 33.15 seconds to construct the tree and 3.23 seconds (best case) to 61.41 minutes (worst case) to fill up the warehouse. This method is proved to be an attractive alternative solution for warehouse layout system.",0
"The advent of the Big Data hype and the consistent recollection of event logs and real-time data from sensors, monitoring software and machine configuration has generated a huge amount of time-varying data in about every sector of the industry. Rule-based processing of such data has ceased to be relevant in many scenarios where anomaly detection and pattern mining have to be entirely accomplished by the machine. Since the early 2000s, the de-facto standard for representing time series has been the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX).In this document, we present a few algorithms using this representation for anomaly detection and motif discovery, also known as pattern mining, in such data. We propose a benchmark of anomaly detection algorithms using data from Cloud monitoring software.",0
"A general method is given for revising degrees of belief and arriving at consistent decisions about a system of logically constrained issues. In contrast to other works about belief revision, here the constraints are assumed to be fixed. The method has two variants, dual of each other, whose revised degrees of belief are respectively above and below the original ones. The upper [resp. lower] revised degrees of belief are uniquely characterized as the lowest [resp. highest] ones that are invariant by a certain max-min [resp. min-max] operation determined by the logical constraints. In both variants, making balance between the revised degree of belief of a proposition and that of its negation leads to decisions that are ensured to be consistent with the logical constraints. These decisions are also ensured to satisfy a property of respect for unanimity about any particular issue. The application of the method to certain special domains comes down to well established or increasingly accepted methods, such as the single-link method of cluster analysis and the method of paths in preferential voting.",0
"Several recently developed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solvers scale to large MAPF instances by searching for MAPF plans on 2 levels: The high-level search resolves collisions between agents, and the low-level search plans paths for single agents under the constraints imposed by the high-level search. We make the following contributions to solve the MAPF problem with imperfect plan execution with small average makespans: First, we formalize the MAPF Problem with Delay Probabilities (MAPF-DP), define valid MAPF-DP plans and propose the use of robust plan-execution policies for valid MAPF-DP plans to control how each agent proceeds along its path. Second, we discuss 2 classes of decentralized robust plan-execution policies (called Fully Synchronized Policies and Minimal Communication Policies) that prevent collisions during plan execution for valid MAPF-DP plans. Third, we present a 2-level MAPF-DP solver (called Approximate Minimization in Expectation) that generates valid MAPF-DP plans.",1
"Electromagnetismlike Optimization (EMO) is a global optimization algorithm, particularly well suited to solve problems featuring nonlinear and multimodal cost functions. EMO employs searcher agents that emulate a population of charged particles which interact to each other according to electromagnetisms laws of attraction and repulsion. However, EMO usually requires a large number of iterations for a local search procedure; any reduction or cancelling over such number, critically perturb other issues such as convergence, exploration, population diversity and accuracy. This paper presents an enhanced EMO algorithm called OBEMO, which employs the Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) approach to accelerate the global convergence speed. OBL is a machine intelligence strategy which considers the current candidate solution and its opposite value at the same time, achieving a faster exploration of the search space. The proposed OBEMO method significantly reduces the required computational effort yet avoiding any detriment to the good search capabilities of the original EMO algorithm. Experiments are conducted over a comprehensive set of benchmark functions, showing that OBEMO obtains promising performance for most of the discussed test problems.",0
"Adaptation has long been considered as the Achilles' heel of case-based reasoning since it requires some domain-specific knowledge that is difficult to acquire. In this paper, two strategies are combined in order to reduce the knowledge engineering cost induced by the adaptation knowledge (CA) acquisition task: CA is learned from the case base by the means of knowledge discovery techniques, and the CA acquisition sessions are opportunistically triggered, i.e., at problem-solving time.",0
"In this paper, the framework of kernel machines with two layers is introduced, generalizing classical kernel methods. The new learning methodology provide a formal connection between computational architectures with multiple layers and the theme of kernel learning in standard regularization methods. First, a representer theorem for two-layer networks is presented, showing that finite linear combinations of kernels on each layer are optimal architectures whenever the corresponding functions solve suitable variational problems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The input-output map expressed by these architectures turns out to be equivalent to a suitable single-layer kernel machines in which the kernel function is also learned from the data. Recently, the so-called multiple kernel learning methods have attracted considerable attention in the machine learning literature. In this paper, multiple kernel learning methods are shown to be specific cases of kernel machines with two layers in which the second layer is linear. Finally, a simple and effective multiple kernel learning method called RLS2 (regularized least squares with two layers) is introduced, and his performances on several learning problems are extensively analyzed. An open source MATLAB toolbox to train and validate RLS2 models with a Graphic User Interface is available.",0
"We consider an agent seeking to obtain an item, potentially available at different locations in a physical environment. The traveling costs between locations are known in advance, but there is only probabilistic knowledge regarding the possible prices of the item at any given location. Given such a setting, the problem is to find a plan that maximizes the probability of acquiring the good while minimizing both travel and purchase costs. Sample applications include agents in search-and-rescue or exploration missions, e.g., a rover on Mars seeking to mine a specific mineral. These probabilistic physical search problems have been previously studied, but we present the first approximation and heuristic algorithms for solving such problems on general graphs. We establish an interesting connection between these problems and classical graph-search problems, which led us to provide the approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation results for our settings. We further suggest several heuristics for practical use, and demonstrate their effectiveness with simulation on real graph structure and synthetic graphs.",0
"Simulation schemes for probabilistic inference in Bayesian belief networks offer many advantages over exact algorithms; for example, these schemes have a linear and thus predictable runtime while exact algorithms have exponential runtime. Experiments have shown that likelihood weighting is one of the most promising simulation schemes. In this paper, we present a new simulation scheme that generates samples more evenly spread in the sample space than the likelihood weighting scheme. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the stratified scheme outperforms likelihood weighting in average runtime and error in estimates of beliefs.",0
"Motivated by the application problem of sensor fusion the author introduced the concept of graded set. It is reasoned that in classification problem arising in an information system (represented by information table), a novel set called Granular set naturally arises. It is realized that in any hierarchical classification problem, Granular set naturally arises. Also when the target set of objects forms a graded set the lower and upper approximations of target sets form a graded set. This generalizes the concept of rough set.

"Many formal languages have been proposed to express or represent Ontologies, including RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL and OWL. Most of these languages are based on XML syntax, but with various terminologies and expressiveness. Therefore, choosing a language for building an Ontology is the main step. The main point of choosing language to represent Ontology is based mainly on what the Ontology will represent or be used for. That language should have a range of quality support features such as ease of use, expressive power, compatibility, sharing and versioning, internationalisation. This is because different kinds of knowledge-based applications need different language features. The main objective of these languages is to add semantics to the existing information on the web. The aims of this paper is to provide a good knowledge of existing language and understanding of these languages and how could be used.",0
"We study the complexity of the problem of searching for a set of patterns that separate two given sets of strings. This problem has applications in a wide variety of areas, most notably in data mining, computational biology, and in understanding the complexity of genetic algorithms. We show that the basic problem of finding a small set of patterns that match one set of strings but do not match any string in a second set is difficult (NP-complete, W[2]-hard when parameterized by the size of the pattern set, and APX-hard). We then perform a detailed parameterized analysis of the problem, separating tractable and intractable variants. In particular we show that parameterizing by the size of pattern set and the number of strings, and the size of the alphabet and the number of strings give FPT results, amongst others.",0
"Combining first-order logic and probability has long been a goal of AI. Markov logic (Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006) accomplishes this by attaching weights to first-order formulas and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. Unfortunately, it does not have the full power of first-order logic, because it is only defined for finite domains. This paper extends Markov logic to infinite domains, by casting it in the framework of Gibbs measures (Georgii, 1988). We show that a Markov logic network (MLN) admits a Gibbs measure as long as each ground atom has a finite number of neighbors. Many interesting cases fall in this category. We also show that an MLN admits a unique measure if the weights of its non-unit clauses are small enough. We then examine the structure of the set of consistent measures in the non-unique case. Many important phenomena, including systems with phase transitions, are represented by MLNs with non-unique measures. We relate the problem of satisfiability in first-order logic to the properties of MLN measures, and discuss how Markov logic relates to previous infinite models.",0
"We report about significant enhancements of the complex algebraic geometry theorem proving subsystem in GeoGebra for automated proofs in Euclidean geometry, concerning the extension of numerous GeoGebra tools with proof capabilities. As a result, a number of elementary theorems can be proven by using GeoGebra's intuitive user interface on various computer architectures including native Java and web based systems with JavaScript. We also provide a test suite for benchmarking our results with 200 test cases.",0
"Max-product Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular message-passing algorithm for computing a Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) assignment over a distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It has been shown that BP can solve a number of combinatorial optimization problems including minimum weight matching, shortest path, network flow and vertex cover under the following common assumption: the respective Linear Programming (LP) relaxation is tight, i.e., no integrality gap is present. However, when LP shows an integrality gap, no model has been known which can be solved systematically via sequential applications of BP. In this paper, we develop the first such algorithm, coined Blossom-BP, for solving the minimum weight matching problem over arbitrary graphs. Each step of the sequential algorithm requires applying BP over a modified graph constructed by contractions and expansions of blossoms, i.e., odd sets of vertices. Our scheme guarantees termination in O(n^2) of BP runs, where n is the number of vertices in the original graph. In essence, the Blossom-BP offers a distributed version of the celebrated Edmonds' Blossom algorithm by jumping at once over many sub-steps with a single BP. Moreover, our result provides an interpretation of the Edmonds' algorithm as a sequence of LPs.",1
"Decision making is an important component in a speaker verification system. For the conventional GMM-UBM architecture, the decision is usually conducted based on the log likelihood ratio of the test utterance against the GMM of the claimed speaker and the UBM. This single-score decision is simple but tends to be sensitive to the complex variations in speech signals (e.g. text content, channel, speaking style, etc.). In this paper, we propose a decision making approach based on multiple scores derived from a set of cohort GMMs (cohort scores). Importantly, these cohort scores are not simply averaged as in conventional cohort methods; instead, we employ a powerful discriminative model as the decision maker. Experimental results show that the proposed method delivers substantial performance improvement over the baseline system, especially when a deep neural network (DNN) is used as the decision maker, and the DNN input involves some statistical features derived from the cohort scores.",0
"""Background subtraction"" is an old technique for finding moving objects in a video sequence for example, cars driving on a freeway. The idea is that subtracting the current image from a timeaveraged background image will leave only nonstationary objects. It is, however, a crude approximation to the task of classifying each pixel of the current image; it fails with slow-moving objects and does not distinguish shadows from moving objects. The basic idea of this paper is that we can classify each pixel using a model of how that pixel looks when it is part of different classes. We learn a mixture-of-Gaussians classification model for each pixel using an unsupervised technique- an efficient, incremental version of EM. Unlike the standard image-averaging approach, this automatically updates the mixture component for each class according to likelihood of membership; hence slow-moving objects are handled perfectly. Our approach also identifies and eliminates shadows much more effectively than other techniques such as thresholding. Application of this method as part of the Roadwatch traffic surveillance project is expected to result in significant improvements in vehicle identification and tracking.",0
"Recently, a multi-level fuzzy min max neural network (MLF) was proposed, which improves the classification accuracy by handling an overlapped region (area of confusion) with the help of a tree structure. In this brief, an extension of MLF is proposed which defines a new boundary region, where the previously proposed methods mark decisions with less confidence and hence misclassification is more frequent. A methodology to classify patterns more accurately is presented. Our work enhances the testing procedure by means of data centroids. We exhibit an illustrative example, clearly highlighting the advantage of our approach. Results on standard datasets are also presented to evidentially prove a consistent improvement in the classification rate.",0
"From the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for the activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning applications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental theoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is constrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the Turing Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe itself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the present paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy point of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination of learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying agent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the problem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in reality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for learning Turing machines.",0
"We analyse the expressiveness of the two-valued semantics of abstract argumentation frameworks, normal logic programs and abstract dialectical frameworks. By expressiveness we mean the ability to encode a desired set of two-valued interpretations over a given propositional signature using only atoms from that signature. While the computational complexity of the two-valued model existence problem for all these languages is (almost) the same, we show that the languages form a neat hierarchy with respect to their expressiveness.",0
"Inspired by the recently introduced framework of AND/OR search spaces for graphical models, we propose to augment Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (MDD) with AND nodes, in order to capture function decomposition structure and to extend these compiled data structures to general weighted graphical models (e.g., probabilistic models). We present the AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagram (AOMDD) which compiles a graphical model into a canonical form that supports polynomial (e.g., solution counting, belief updating) or constant time (e.g. equivalence of graphical models) queries. We provide two algorithms for compiling the AOMDD of a graphical model. The first is search-based, and works by applying reduction rules to the trace of the memory intensive AND/OR search algorithm. The second is inference-based and uses a Bucket Elimination schedule to combine the AOMDDs of the input functions via the the APPLY operator. For both algorithms, the compilation time and the size of the AOMDD are, in the worst case, exponential in the treewidth of the graphical model, rather than pathwidth as is known for ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). We introduce the concept of semantic treewidth, which helps explain why the size of a decision diagram is often much smaller than the worst case bound. We provide an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the potential of AOMDDs.",0
"Content-Centric Networking (CCN) research addresses the mismatch between the modern usage of the Internet and its outdated architecture. Importantly, CCN routers may locally cache frequently requested content in order to speed up delivery to end users. Thus, the issue of caching strategies arises, i.e., which content shall be stored and when it should be replaced. In this work, we employ novel techniques towards intelligent administration of CCN routers that autonomously switch between existing strategies in response to changing content request patterns. In particular, we present a router architecture for CCN networks that is controlled by rule-based stream reasoning, following the recent formal framework LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams. The obtained possibility for flexible router configuration at runtime allows for faster experimentation and may thus help to advance the further development of CCN. Moreover, the empirical evaluation of our feasibility study shows that the resulting caching agent may give significant performance gains.",0
"The work presented here involves the design of a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based pattern classifier for recognition of handwritten Bangla digits using a 76 element feature vector. Bangla is the second most popular script and language in the Indian subcontinent and the fifth most popular language in the world. The feature set developed for representing handwritten Bangla numerals here includes 24 shadow features, 16 centroid features and 36 longest-run features. On experimentation with a database of 6000 samples, the technique yields an average recognition rate of 96.67% evaluated after three-fold cross validation of results. It is useful for applications related to OCR of handwritten Bangla Digit and can also be extended to include OCR of handwritten characters of Bangla alphabet.",0

Applying the test to variety of devices that constitute Internet of Things poses a number of challenges which could be addressed through a number of adaptations.",0

"Debate summarization is one of the novel and challenging research areas in automatic text summarization which has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a debate summarization pipeline to summarize key topics which are discussed or argued in the two opposing sides of online debates. We view that the generation of debate summaries can be achieved by clustering, cluster labeling, and visualization. In our work, we investigate two different clustering approaches for the generation of the summaries. In the first approach, we generate the summaries by applying purely term-based clustering and cluster labeling. The second approach makes use of X-means for clustering and Mutual Information for labeling the clusters. Both approaches are driven by ontologies. We visualize the results using bar charts. We think that our results are a smooth entry for users aiming to receive the first impression about what is discussed within a debate topic containing waste number of argumentations.",0
"We introduce a new class of graphical representations, expected utility networks (EUNs), and discuss some of its properties and potential applications to artificial intelligence and economic theory. In EUNs not only probabilities, but also utilities enjoy a modular representation. EUNs are undirected graphs with two types of arc, representing probability and utility dependencies respectively. The representation of utilities is based on a novel notion of conditional utility independence, which we introduce and discuss in the context of other existing proposals. Just as probabilistic inference involves the computation of conditional probabilities, strategic inference involves the computation of conditional expected utilities for alternative plans of action. We define a new notion of conditional expected utility (EU) independence, and show that in EUNs node separation with respect to the probability and utility subgraphs implies conditional EU independence.",0
"Analysis of regional development imbalances quadrant has a very important meaning in order to see the extent of achievement of the development of certain areas as well as the difference. Factors that could be used as a tool to measure the inequality of development is to look at the average growth and development contribution of each sector of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) based on the analyzed region and the reference region. This study discusses the development of a model to determine the regional development imbalances using fuzzy approach system, and the rules of typology Klassen. The model is then called fuzzy-Klassen. Implications Product Mamdani fuzzy system is used in the model as an inference engine to generate output after defuzzyfication process. Application of MATLAB is used as a tool of analysis in this study. The test a result of Kota Cilegon is shows that there are significant differences between traditional Klassen typology analyses with the results of the model developed. Fuzzy model-Klassen shows GRDP sector inequality Cilegon City is dominated by Quadrant I (K4), where status is the sector forward and grows exponentially. While the traditional Klassen typology, half of GRDP sector is dominated by Quadrant IV (K4) with a sector that is lagging relative status.",0
"This paper describes an architecture that combines the complementary strengths of probabilistic graphical models and declarative programming to enable robots to represent and reason with qualitative and quantitative descriptions of uncertainty and domain knowledge. The architecture comprises three components: a controller, a logician and an executor. The logician uses a coarse-resolution, qualitative model of the world and logical reasoning to plan a sequence of abstract actions for an assigned goal. For each abstract action to be executed, the executor uses probabilistic information at finer granularity and probabilistic algorithms to execute a sequence of concrete actions, and to report observations of the environment. The controller dispatches goals and relevant information to the logician and executor, collects and processes information from these components, refines the coarse-resolution description to obtain the probabilistic information at finer granularity for each abstract action, and computes the policy for executing the abstract action using probabilistic algorithms. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot moving objects in an indoor domain, to show that it supports reasoning with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions, in complex domains.",0
"In this paper we introduce a new unsupervised reinforcement learning method for discovering the set of intrinsic options available to an agent. This set is learned by maximizing the number of different states an agent can reliably reach, as measured by the mutual information between the set of options and option termination states. To this end, we instantiate two policy gradient based algorithms, one that creates an explicit embedding space of options and one that represents options implicitly. The algorithms also provide an explicit measure of empowerment in a given state that can be used by an empowerment maximizing agent. The algorithm scales well with function approximation and we demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on a range of tasks.",0
"Optimization of product performance repetitively introduces the need to make products adaptive in a more general sense. This more general idea is often captured under the term 'self-configuration'. Despite the importance of such capability, research work on this feature appears isolated by technical domains. It is not easy to tell quickly whether the approaches chosen in different technological domains introduce new ideas or whether the differences just reflect domain idiosyncrasies. For the sake of easy identification of key differences between systems with self-configuring capabilities, I will explore higher level concepts for understanding self-configuration, such as the {\Omega}-units, in order to provide theoretical instruments for connecting different areas of technology and research.",0
"An agent-based negotiation team is a group of interdependent agents that join together as a single negotiation party due to their shared interests in the negotiation at hand. The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities, (ii) unite agents with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to tackle complex negotiation domains, (iii) the necessity to represent different stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations, countries, and married couple). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas. The analysis aims to identify special challenges that may arise due to the particularities of agent-based negotiation teams.",0
"Crowdsourcing platforms enable to propose simple human intelligence tasks to a large number of participants who realise these tasks. The workers often receive a small amount of money or the platforms include some other incentive mechanisms, for example they can increase the workers reputation score, if they complete the tasks correctly. We address the problem of identifying experts among participants, that is, workers, who tend to answer the questions correctly. Knowing who are the reliable workers could improve the quality of knowledge one can extract from responses. As opposed to other works in the literature, we assume that participants can give partial or incomplete responses, in case they are not sure that their answers are correct. We model such partial or incomplete responses with the help of belief functions, and we derive a measure that characterizes the expertise level of each participant. This measure is based on precise and exactitude degrees that represent two parts of the expertise level. The precision degree reflects the reliability level of the participants and the exactitude degree reflects the knowledge level of the participants. We also analyze our model through simulation and demonstrate that our richer model can lead to more reliable identification of experts.",0
"Cardinality constraints or, more generally, weight constraints are well recognized as an important extension of answer-set programming. Clearly, all common algorithmic tasks related to programs with cardinality or weight constraints - like checking the consistency of a program - are intractable. Many intractable problems in the area of knowledge representation and reasoning have been shown to become linear time tractable if the treewidth of the programs or formulas under consideration is bounded by some constant. The goal of this paper is to apply the notion of treewidth to programs with cardinality or weight constraints and to identify tractable fragments. It will turn out that the straightforward application of treewidth to such class of programs does not suffice to obtain tractability. However, by imposing further restrictions, tractability can be achieved.",0
"Multi-agent planning (MAP) approaches have been typically conceived for independent or loosely-coupled problems to enhance the benefits of distributed planning between autonomous agents as solving this type of problems require less coordination between the agents' sub-plans. However, when it comes to tightly-coupled agents' tasks, MAP has been relegated in favour of centralized approaches and little work has been done in this direction. In this paper, we present a general-purpose MAP capable to efficiently handle planning problems with any level of coupling between agents. We propose a cooperative refinement planning approach, built upon the partial-order planning paradigm, that allows agents to work with incomplete information and to have incomplete views of the world, i.e. being ignorant of other agents' information, as well as maintaining their own private information. We show various experiments to compare the performance of our system with a distributed CSP-based MAP approach over a suite of problems.",0
"The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled general framework for planning under uncertainty, but solving POMDPs optimally is computationally intractable, due to the ""curse of dimensionality"" and the ""curse of history"". To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT), a sparse approximation of the standard belief tree, for online planning under uncertainty. A DESPOT focuses online planning on a set of randomly sampled scenarios and compactly captures the ""execution"" of all policies under these scenarios. We show that the best policy obtained from a DESPOT is near-optimal, with a regret bound that depends on the representation size of the optimal policy. Leveraging this result, we give an anytime online planning algorithm, which searches a DESPOT for a policy that optimizes a regularized objective function. Regularization balances the estimated value of a policy under the sampled scenarios and the policy size, thus avoiding overfitting. The algorithm demonstrates strong experimental results, compared with some of the best online POMDP algorithms available. It has also been incorporated into an autonomous driving system for realtime vehicle control. The source code for the algorithm is available at http: //bigbird.comp.nus.edu.sg/pmwiki/farm/appl/.",1
"We consider the task of performing probabilistic inference with probabilistic logical models. Many algorithms for approximate inference with such models are based on sampling. From a logic programming perspective, sampling boils down to repeatedly calling the same queries on a knowledge base composed of a static part and a dynamic part. The larger the static part, the more redundancy there is in these repeated calls. This is problematic since inefficient sampling yields poor approximations.",0
"Programmers may be hesitant to use declarative systems, because of the associated learning curve. In this paper, we present an API that integrates the IDP Knowledge Base system into the Python programming language. IDP is a state-of-the-art logical system, which uses SAT, SMT, Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming technology. Python is currently one of the most widely used (teaching) languages for programming. The first goal of our API is to allow a Python programmer to use the declarative power of IDP, without needing to learn any new syntax or semantics. The second goal is allow IDP to be added to/removed from an existing code base with minimal changes.",0
"Certain causal models involving unmeasured variables induce no independence constraints among the observed variables but imply, nevertheless, inequality contraints on the observed distribution. This paper derives a general formula for such instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account for the data, or, conversely, whether a given variables can be deemed instrumental.",0
"The Schatten-p quasi-norm $(0&lt;p&lt;1)$ is usually used to replace the standard nuclear norm in order to approximate the rank function more accurately. However, existing Schatten-p quasi-norm minimization algorithms involve singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) in each iteration, and thus may become very slow and impractical for large-scale problems. In this paper, we first define two tractable Schatten quasi-norms, i.e., the Frobenius/nuclear hybrid and bi-nuclear quasi-norms, and then prove that they are in essence the Schatten-2/3 and 1/2 quasi-norms, respectively, which lead to the design of very efficient algorithms that only need to update two much smaller factor matrices. We also design two efficient proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithms for solving representative matrix completion problems. Finally, we provide the global convergence and performance guarantees for our algorithms, which have better convergence properties than existing algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithms are more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods, and are orders of magnitude faster.",1
"An ordinal view of independence is studied in the framework of possibility theory. We investigate three possible definitions of dependence, of increasing strength. One of them is the counterpart to the multiplication law in probability theory, and the two others are based on the notion of conditional possibility. These two have enough expressive power to support the whole possibility theory, and a complete axiomatization is provided for the strongest one. Moreover we show that weak independence is well-suited to the problems of belief change and plausible reasoning, especially to address the problem of blocking of property inheritance in exception-tolerant taxonomic reasoning.",0
"Congestion problems are omnipresent in today's complex networks and represent a challenge in many research domains. In the context of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource abstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource abstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource allocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance and applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented assumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the literature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both settings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource and keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can promote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a real-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what knowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network Domain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of a network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the load on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse their performance. RND allows us to highlight an important limitation of resource abstraction and show that the difference rewards approach manages to better capture and inform the agents about the dynamics of the environment.",0

"Modern SAT solvers have experienced a remarkable progress on solving industrial instances. Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process.

"We introduce the notion of online reactive planning with sensing actions for systems with temporal logic constraints in partially observable and dynamic environments. With incomplete information on the dynamic environment, reactive controller synthesis amounts to solving a two-player game with partial observations, which has impractically computational complexity. To alleviate the high computational burden, online replanning via sensing actions avoids solving the strategy in the reactive system under partial observations. Instead, we only solve for a strategy that ensures a given temporal logic specification can be satisfied had the system have complete observations of its environment. Such a strategy is then transformed into one which makes control decisions based on the observed sequence of states (of the interacting system and its environment). When the system encounters a belief---a set including all possible hypotheses the system has for the current state---for which the observation-based strategy is undefined, a sequence of sensing actions are triggered, chosen by an active sensing strategy, to reduce the uncertainty in the system's belief. We show that by alternating between the observation-based strategy and the active sensing strategy, under a mild technical assumption of the set of sensors in the system, the given temporal logic specification can be satisfied with probability 1.",0
"Annotating semantic data with metadata is becoming more and more important to provide information about the statements being asserted. While initial solutions proposed a data model to represent a specific dimension of meta-information (such as time or provenance), the need for a general annotation framework which allows representing different context dimensions is needed. In this paper, we extend the 4dFluents ontology by Welty and Fikes---on associating temporal validity to statements---to any dimension of context, and discuss possible issues that multidimensional context representations have to face and how we address them.",0
"Abstract argumentation offers an appealing way of representing and evaluating arguments and counterarguments. This approach can be enhanced by a probability assignment to each argument. There are various interpretations that can be ascribed to this assignment. In this paper, we regard the assignment as denoting the belief that an agent has that an argument is justifiable, i.e., that both the premises of the argument and the derivation of the claim of the argument from its premises are valid. This leads to the notion of an epistemic extension which is the subset of the arguments in the graph that are believed to some degree (which we defined as the arguments that have a probability assignment greater than 0.5). We consider various constraints on the probability assignment. Some constraints correspond to standard notions of extensions, such as grounded or stable extensions, and some constraints give us new kinds of extensions.",0
"Based on integrated infrastructure of resource sharing and computing in distributed environment, cloud computing involves the provision of dynamically scalable and provides virtualized resources as services over the Internet. These applications also bring a large scale heterogeneous and distributed information which pose a great challenge in terms of the semantic ambiguity. It is critical for application services in cloud computing environment to provide users intelligent service and precise information. Semantic information processing can help users deal with semantic ambiguity and information overload efficiently through appropriate semantic models and semantic information processing technology. The semantic information processing have been successfully employed in many fields such as the knowledge representation, natural language understanding, intelligent web search, etc. The purpose of this report is to give an overview of existing technologies for semantic information processing in cloud computing environment, to propose a research direction for addressing distributed semantic reasoning and parallel semantic computing by exploiting semantic information newly available in cloud computing environment.",0
"Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a recent construction process based on a 3D model, containing every component related to the building achievement. Architects, structure engineers, method engineers, and others participant to the building process work on this model through the design-to-construction cycle. The high complexity and the large amount of information included in these models raise several issues, delaying its wide adoption in the industrial world. One of the most important is the visualization: professionals have difficulties to find out the relevant information for their job. Actual solutions suffer from two limitations: the BIM models information are processed manually and insignificant information are simply hidden, leading to inconsistencies in the building model. This paper describes a system relying on an ontological representation of the building information to label automatically the building elements. Depending on the user's department, the visualization is modified according to these labels by automatically adjusting the colors and image properties based on a saliency model. The proposed saliency model incorporates several adaptations to fit the specificities of architectural images.",0
"Automatic optimization of spoken dialog management policies that are robust to environmental noise has long been the goal for both academia and industry. Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proved to be effective. However, the numerical representation of dialog policy is human-incomprehensible and difficult for dialog system designers to verify or modify, which limits its practical application. In this paper we propose a novel framework for optimizing dialog policies specified in domain language using genetic algorithm. The human-interpretable representation of policy makes the method suitable for practical employment. We present learning algorithms using user simulation and real human-machine dialogs respectively.Empirical experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",0
"Many large MDPs can be represented compactly using a dynamic Bayesian network. Although the structure of the value function does not retain the structure of the process, recent work has shown that value functions in factored MDPs can often be approximated well using a decomposed value function: a linear combination of &lt;I&gt;restricted&lt;/I&gt; basis functions, each of which refers only to a small subset of variables. An approximate value function for a particular policy can be computed using approximate dynamic programming, but this approach (and others) can only produce an approximation relative to a distance metric which is weighted by the stationary distribution of the current policy. This type of weighted projection is ill-suited to policy improvement. We present a new approach to value determination, that uses a simple closed-form computation to directly compute a least-squares decomposed approximation to the value function &lt;I&gt;for any weights&lt;/I&gt;. We then use this value determination algorithm as a subroutine in a policy iteration process. We show that, under reasonable restrictions, the policies induced by a factored value function are compactly represented, and can be manipulated efficiently in a policy iteration process. We also present a method for computing error bounds for decomposed value functions using a variable-elimination algorithm for function optimization. The complexity of all of our algorithms depends on the factorization of system dynamics and of the approximate value function.",0
"Vision-based object detection is one of the fundamental functions in numerous traffic scene applications such as self-driving vehicle systems and advance driver assistance systems (ADAS). However, it is also a challenging task due to the diversity of traffic scene and the storage, power and computing source limitations of the platforms for traffic scene applications. This paper presents a generalized Haar filter based deep network which is suitable for the object detection tasks in traffic scene. In this approach, we first decompose a object detection task into several easier local regression tasks. Then, we handle the local regression tasks by using several tiny deep networks which simultaneously output the bounding boxes, categories and confidence scores of detected objects. To reduce the consumption of storage and computing resources, the weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized Haar filter in training phase. Additionally, we introduce the strategy of sparse windows generation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we perform several experiments to validate the performance of our proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and effective in traffic scene compared with the state-of-the-art.",0
"High computational costs of manifold learning prohibit its application for large point sets. A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the entire dataset with the Nystr\""om method. The two main challenges that arise are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds. Our experiments show a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art landmark selection techniques.",0
"In this paper we introduce a new network reachability problem where the goal is to find the most reliable path between two nodes in a network, represented as a directed acyclic graph. Individual edges within this network may fail according to certain probabilities, and these failure probabilities may depend on the values of one or more hidden variables. This problem may be viewed as a generalization of shortest-path problems for finding minimum cost paths or Viterbi-type problems for finding highest-probability sequences of states, where the addition of the hidden variables introduces correlations that are not handled by previous algorithms. We give theoretical results characterizing this problem including an NP-hardness proof. We also give an exact algorithm and a more efficient approximation algorithm for this problem.",0
"In many real world elections, agents are not required to rank all candidates. We study three of the most common methods used to modify voting rules to deal with such partial votes. These methods modify scoring rules (like the Borda count), elimination style rules (like single transferable vote) and rules based on the tournament graph (like Copeland) respectively. We argue that with an elimination style voting rule like single transferable vote, partial voting does not change the situations where strategic voting is possible. However, with scoring rules and rules based on the tournament graph, partial voting can increase the situations where strategic voting is possible. As a consequence, the computational complexity of computing a strategic vote can change. For example, with Borda count, the complexity of computing a strategic vote can decrease or stay the same depending on how we score partial votes.",0
"Parameter estimation based on uncertain data represented as belief structures is one of the latest problems in the Dempster-Shafer theory. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures. Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and minimization of estimated parameter's uncertainty are taken into consideration simultaneously. As an illustration, the proposed method is employed to estimate parameters for deterministic and uncertain belief structures, which demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility.",0

An analysis of current approaches to autonomous control is provided followed by an exploration of how these techniques can be extended and enriched with AI techniques including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Ensembling and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to evolve control strategies for UCAVs.",0
"Neural Turing Machines (NTM) contain memory component that simulates ""working memory"" in the brain to store and retrieve information to ease simple algorithms learning. So far, only linearly organized memory is proposed, and during experiments, we observed that the model does not always converge, and overfits easily when handling certain tasks. We think memory component is key to some faulty behaviors of NTM, and better organization of memory component could help fight those problems. In this paper, we propose several different structures of memory for NTM, and we proved in experiments that two of our proposed structured-memory NTMs could lead to better convergence, in term of speed and prediction accuracy on copy task and associative recall task as in (Graves et al. 2014).",0
"The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is one of the simplest and most common classifiers, yet its performance competes with the most complex classifiers in the literature. The core of this classifier depends mainly on measuring the distance or similarity between the tested example and the training examples. This raises a major question about which distance measures to be used for the KNN classifier among a large number of distance and similarity measures? This review attempts to answer the previous question through evaluating the performance (measured by accuracy, precision and recall) of the KNN using a large number of distance measures, tested on a number of real world datasets, with and without adding different levels of noise. The experimental results show that the performance of KNN classifier depends significantly on the distance used, the results showed large gaps between the performances of different distances. We found that a recently proposed non-convex distance performed the best when applied on most datasets comparing to the other tested distances. In addition, the performance of the KNN degraded only about $20\%$ while the noise level reaches $90\%$, this is true for all the distances used. This means that the KNN classifier using any of the top $10$ distances tolerate noise to a certain degree. Moreover, the results show that some distances are less affected by the added noise comparing to other distances.",0
We propose an online spatiotemporal articulation model estimation framework that estimates both articulated structure as well as a temporal prediction model solely using passive observations. The resulting model can predict future mo- tions of an articulated object with high confidence because of the spatial and temporal structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive model by incorporating it within a standard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipeline for mapping and robot localization in previously unexplored dynamic environments. Our method is able to localize the robot and map a dynamic scene by explaining the observed motion in the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both simulated and real-world dynamic environments.,0
"The number of optimization techniques in the combinatorial domain is large and diversified. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of real benchmarks to validate optimization algorithms. In this work we introduce VRPBench, a tool to create instances and visualize solutions to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in a planar graph embedded in the Euclidean 2D space. We use VRPBench to model a real-world mail delivery case of the city of Artur Nogueira. Such scenarios were characterized as a multi-objective optimization of the VRP. We extracted a weighted graph from a digital map of the city to create a challenging benchmark for the VRP. Each instance models one generic day of mail delivery with hundreds to thousands of delivery points, thus allowing both the comparison and validation of optimization algorithms for routing problems.",0
"Estimating the confidence for a link is a critical task for Knowledge Graph construction. Link prediction, or predicting the likelihood of a link in a knowledge graph based on prior state is a key research direction within this area. We propose a Latent Feature Embedding based link recommendation model for prediction task and utilize Bayesian Personalized Ranking based optimization technique for learning models for each predicate. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, we also study the performance of the link prediction algorithm in terms of topological properties of the Knowledge Graph and present a linear regression model to reason about its expected level of accuracy.",0
"Here, I review current state-of-the-arts in many areas of AI to estimate when it's reasonable to expect human level AI development. Predictions of prominent AI researchers vary broadly from very pessimistic predictions of Andrew Ng to much more moderate predictions of Geoffrey Hinton and optimistic predictions of Shane Legg, DeepMind cofounder. Given huge rate of progress in recent years and this broad range of predictions of AI experts, AI safety questions are also discussed.",0
"Call control features (e.g., call-divert, voice-mail) are primitive options to which users can subscribe off-line to personalise their service. The configuration of a feature subscription involves choosing and sequencing features from a catalogue and is subject to constraints that prevent undesirable feature interactions at run-time. When the subscription requested by a user is inconsistent, one problem is to find an optimal relaxation, which is a generalisation of the feedback vertex set problem on directed graphs, and thus it is an NP-hard task. We present several constraint programming formulations of the problem. We also present formulations using partial weighted maximum Boolean satisfiability and mixed integer linear programming. We study all these formulations by experimentally comparing them on a variety of randomly generated instances of the feature subscription problem.",0
"Boosting combines weak classifiers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classification is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the ""correct"" requirements on the weak classifier, or the notion of the most efficient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classifier, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements.",1

"To support a freight carrier in a combinatorial transport auction, we proposes an exact and two heuristic strategies for bidding on subsets of requests. The exact bidding strategy is based on the concept of elementary request combinations. We show that it is sufficient and necessary for a carrier to bid on each elementary request combination in order to guarantee the same result as bidding on each element of the powerset of the set of tendered requests. Both heuristic bidding strategies identify promising request combinations. For this, pairwise synergies based on saving values as well as the capacitated p-median problem are used. The bidding strategies are evaluated by a computational study that simulates an auction. It is based on 174 benchmark instances and therefore easily extendable by other researchers. On average, the two heuristic strategies achieve 91 percent and 81 percent of the available sales potential while generating 36 and only 4 percent of the bundle bids of the exact strategy. Therefore, the proposed bidding strategies help a carrier to increase her chance to win and at the same time reduce the computational burden to participate in a combinatorial transport auction.",0
"In this paper we address the problem of decision making within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework where risk and modeling errors are taken into account. Our approach is to minimize a risk-sensitive conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) objective, as opposed to a standard risk-neutral expectation. We refer to such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative interpretation as expected cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given error budget. This result, which is of independent interest, motivates CVaR MDPs as a unifying framework for risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our second contribution is to present an approximate value-iteration algorithm for CVaR MDPs and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and show the practicality of our approach.",1
"This article studies the problem of modifying the action ordering of a plan in order to optimise the plan according to various criteria. One of these criteria is to make a plan less constrained and the other is to minimize its parallel execution time. Three candidate definitions are proposed for the first of these criteria, constituting a sequence of increasing optimality guarantees. Two of these are based on deordering plans, which means that ordering relations may only be removed, not added, while the third one uses reordering, where arbitrary modifications to the ordering are allowed. It is shown that only the weakest one of the three criteria is tractable to achieve, the other two being NP-hard and even difficult to approximate. Similarly, optimising the parallel execution time of a plan is studied both for deordering and reordering of plans. In the general case, both of these computations are NP-hard. However, it is shown that optimal deorderings can be computed in polynomial time for a class of planning languages based on the notions of producers, consumers and threats, which includes most of the commonly used planning languages. Computing optimal reorderings can potentially lead to even faster parallel executions, but this problem remains NP-hard and difficult to approximate even under quite severe restrictions.",0
"Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem well studied in artificial intelligence and robotics. It has many real-world applications for which existing MAPF solvers use various heuristics. However, these solvers are deterministic and perform poorly on ""hard"" instances typically characterized by many agents interfering with each other in a small region. In this paper, we enhance MAPF solvers with randomization and observe that they exhibit heavy-tailed distributions of runtimes on hard instances. This leads us to develop simple rapid randomized restart (RRR) strategies with the intuition that, given a hard instance, multiple short runs have a better chance of solving it compared to one long run. We validate this intuition through experiments and show that our RRR strategies indeed boost the performance of state-of-the-art MAPF solvers such as iECBS and M*.",0
"Top-$N$ recommender systems have been extensively studied. However, the sparsity of user-item activities has not been well resolved. While many hybrid systems were proposed to address the cold-start problem, the profile information has not been sufficiently leveraged. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of profiles between users and items intensifies the challenge. In this paper, we propose a content-based top-$N$ recommender system by learning the global term weights in profiles. To achieve this, we bring in PathSim, which could well measures the node similarity with heterogeneous relations (between users and items). Starting from the original TF-IDF value, the global term weights gradually converge, and eventually reflect both profile and activity information. To facilitate training, the derivative is reformulated into matrix form, which could easily be paralleled. We conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",0
"Recent works on cost based relaxations have improved Constraint Programming (CP) models for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We provide a short survey over solving asymmetric TSP with CP. Then, we suggest new implied propagators based on general graph properties. We experimentally show that such implied propagators bring robustness to pathological instances and highlight the fact that graph structure can significantly improve search heuristics behavior. Finally, we show that our approach outperforms current state of the art results.",0
"We propose a novel value function approximation technique for Markov decision processes. We consider the problem of compactly representing the state-action value function using a low-rank and sparse matrix model. The problem is to decompose a matrix that encodes the true value function into low-rank and sparse components, and we achieve this using Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Under minimal assumptions, this Robust PCA problem can be solved exactly via the Principal Component Pursuit convex optimization problem. We experiment the procedure on several examples and demonstrate that our method yields approximations essentially identical to the true function.",0

"In this paper we compare three different architectures for the evaluation of influence diagrams: HUGIN, Shafer-Shenoy, and Lazy Evaluation architecture. The computational complexity of the architectures are compared on the LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID): a diagram where only the requiste information for the computation of the optimal policies are depicted. Because the requsite information is explicitly represented in the LIMID the evaluation can take advantage of it, and significant savings in computational can be obtained. In this paper we show how the obtained savings is considerably increased when the computations performed on the LIMID is according to the Lazy Evaluation scheme.",0
"There is both much optimism and pessimism around artificial intelligence (AI) today. The optimists are investing millions of dollars, and even in some cases billions of dollars into AI. The pessimists, on the other hand, predict that AI will end many things: jobs, warfare, and even the human race. Both the optimists and the pessimists often appeal to the idea of a technological singularity, a point in time where machine intelligence starts to run away, and a new, more intelligent species starts to inhabit the earth. If the optimists are right, this will be a moment that fundamentally changes our economy and our society. If the pessimists are right, this will be a moment that also fundamentally changes our economy and our society. It is therefore very worthwhile spending some time deciding if either of them might be right.",0
"Many methods have been developed to secure the network infrastructure and communication over the Internet. Intrusion detection is a relatively new addition to such techniques. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to find out if someone has intrusion into or is trying to get it the network. One big problem is amount of Intrusion which is increasing day by day. We need to know about network attack information using IDS, then analysing the effect. Due to the nature of IDSs which are solely signature based, every new intrusion cannot be detected; so it is important to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) methods / techniques in IDS. Introduction of AI necessitates the importance of normalization in intrusions. This work is focused on classification of AI based IDS techniques which will help better design intrusion detection systems in the future. We have also proposed a support vector machine for IDS to detect Smurf attack with much reliable accuracy.",0
"The shift from industrial economy to knowledge economy in today's world has revolutionalized strategic planning in organizations as well as their problem solving approaches. The point of focus today is knowledge and service production with more emphasis been laid on knowledge capital. Many organizations are investing on tools that facilitate knowledge sharing among their employees and they are as well promoting and encouraging collaboration among their staff in order to build the organization's knowledge capital with the ultimate goal of creating a lasting competitive advantage for their organizations. One of the current leading approaches used for solving organization's decision problem is the Economic Intelligence (EI) approach which involves interactions among various actors called EI actors. These actors collaborate to ensure the overall success of the decision problem solving process. In the course of the collaboration, the actors express knowledge which could be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, we propose in the first place, an annotation model for knowledge elicitation among EI actors. Because of the need to build a knowledge capital, we also propose a dynamic knowledge capitalisation approach for managing knowledge produced by the actors. Finally, the need to manage the interactions and the interdependencies among collaborating EI actors, led to our third proposition which constitute an awareness mechanism for group work management.",0
"Many information sources are considered into data fusion in order to improve the decision in terms of uncertainty and imprecision.

"Areas where Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; related fields are finding their applications are increasing day by day, moving from core areas of computer science they are finding their applications in various other domains.In recent times Machine Learning i.e. a sub-domain of AI has been widely used in order to assist medical experts and doctors in the prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases and other medical disorders. In this manuscript the authors applied various machine learning algorithms to a problem in the domain of medical diagnosis and analyzed their efficiency in predicting the results. The problem selected for the study is the diagnosis of the Chronic Kidney Disease.The dataset used for the study consists of 400 instances and 24 attributes. The authors evaluated 12 classification techniques by applying them to the Chronic Kidney Disease data. In order to calculate efficiency, results of the prediction by candidate methods were compared with the actual medical results of the subject.The various metrics used for performance evaluation are predictive accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. The results indicate that decision-tree performed best with nearly the accuracy of 98.6%, sensitivity of 0.9720, precision of 1 and specificity of 1.",0
"This dissertation is motivated by the need, in today's globalist world, for a precise way to enable governments, organisations and other regulatory bodies to evaluate the constraints they place on themselves and others. An organisation's modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions, such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.",0
In this paper we study multi robot cooperative task allocation issue in a situation where a swarm of robots is deployed in a confined unknown environment where the number of colored spots which represent tasks and the ratios of them are unknown. The robots should cover this spots as far as possible to do cleaning and sampling actions desirably. It means that they should discover the spots cooperatively and spread proportional to the spots area and avoid from remaining idle. We proposed 4 self-organized distributed methods which are called hybrid methods for coping with this scenario. In two different experiments the performance of the methods is analyzed. We compared them with each other and investigated their scalability and robustness in term of single point of failure.,0
"Privacy has traditionally been a major motivation for distributed problem solving. Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (DisCSP) as well as Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) are fundamental models used to solve various families of distributed problems. Even though several approaches have been proposed to quantify and preserve privacy in such problems, none of them is exempt from limitations. Here we approach the problem by assuming that computation is performed among utilitarian agents. We introduce a utilitarian approach where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference between the reward for reaching an agreement on assignments of shared variables and the cost of privacy loss. We investigate extensions to solvers where agents integrate the utility function to guide their search and decide which action to perform, defining thereby their policy. We show that these extended solvers succeed in significantly reducing privacy loss without significant degradation of the solution quality.",0

"Since the late 1990s when speech companies began providing their customer-service software in the market, people have gotten used to speaking to machines. As people interact more often with voice and gesture controlled machines, they expect the machines to recognize different emotions, and understand other high level communication features such as humor, sarcasm and intention. In order to make such communication possible, the machines need an empathy module in them which can extract emotions from human speech and behavior and can decide the correct response of the robot. Although research on empathetic robots is still in the early stage, we described our approach using signal processing techniques, sentiment analysis and machine learning algorithms to make robots that can ""understand"" human emotion. We propose Zara the Supergirl as a prototype system of empathetic robots. It is a software based virtual android, with an animated cartoon character to present itself on the screen. She will get ""smarter"" and more empathetic through its deep learning algorithms, and by gathering more data and learning from it. In this paper, we present our work so far in the areas of deep learning of emotion and sentiment recognition, as well as humor recognition. We hope to explore the future direction of android development and how it can help improve people's lives.",0
"Recent work on weighted model counting has been very successfully applied to the problem of probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks. The probability distribution is encoded into a Boolean normal form and compiled to a target language, in order to represent local structure expressed among conditional probabilities more efficiently. We show that further improvements are possible, by exploiting the knowledge that is lost during the encoding phase and incorporating it into a compiler inspired by Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Constraints among variables are used as a background theory, which allows us to optimize the Shannon decomposition. We propose a new language, called Weighted Positive Binary Decision Diagrams, that reduces the cost of probabilistic inference by using this decomposition variant to induce an arithmetic circuit of reduced size.",0
"A general approach to knowledge transfer is introduced in which an agent controlled by a neural network adapts how it reuses existing networks as it learns in a new domain. Networks trained for a new domain can improve their performance by routing activation selectively through previously learned neural structure, regardless of how or for what it was learned. A neuroevolution implementation of this approach is presented with application to high-dimensional sequential decision-making domains. This approach is more general than previous approaches to neural transfer for reinforcement learning. It is domain-agnostic and requires no prior assumptions about the nature of task relatedness or mappings. The method is analyzed in a stochastic version of the Arcade Learning Environment, demonstrating that it improves performance in some of the more complex Atari 2600 games, and that the success of transfer can be predicted based on a high-level characterization of game dynamics.",1
"With the technology development, the need of analyze and extraction of useful information is increasing. Bayesian networks contain knowledge from data and experts that could be used for decision making processes But they are not easily understandable thus the rule extraction methods have been used but they have high computation costs. To overcome this problem we extract rules from Bayesian network using genetic algorithm. Then we generate the graphical chain by mutually matching the extracted rules and Bayesian network. This graphical chain could shows the sequence of events that lead to the target which could help the decision making process. The experimental results on small networks show that the proposed method has comparable results with brute force method which has a significantly higher computation cost.",0
"We study a general task allocation problem, involving multiple agents that collaboratively accomplish tasks and where agents may fail to successfully complete the tasks assigned to them (known as execution uncertainty). The goal is to choose an allocation that maximises social welfare while taking their execution uncertainty into account. We show that this can be achieved by using the post-execution verification (PEV)-based mechanism if and only if agents' valuations satisfy a multilinearity condition. We then consider a more complex setting where an agent's execution uncertainty is not completely predictable by the agent alone but aggregated from all agents' private opinions (known as trust). We show that PEV-based mechanism with trust is still truthfully implementable if and only if the trust aggregation is multilinear.",0
"Some existing notions of redundancy among association rules allow for a logical-style characterization and lead to irredundant bases of absolutely minimum size. One can push the intuition of redundancy further and find an intuitive notion of interest of an association rule, in terms of its ""novelty"" with respect to other rules. Namely: an irredundant rule is so because its confidence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one can ask: how much higher? We propose to measure such a sort of ""novelty"" through the confidence boost of a rule, which encompasses two previous similar notions (confidence width and rule blocking, of which the latter is closely related to the earlier measure ""improvement""). Acting as a complement to confidence and support, the confidence boost helps to obtain small and crisp sets of mined association rules, and solves the well-known problem that, in certain cases, rules of negative correlation may pass the confidence bound. We analyze the properties of two versions of the notion of confidence boost, one of them a natural generalization of the other. We develop efficient algorithmics to filter rules according to their confidence boost, compare the concept to some similar notions in the bibliography, and describe the results of some experimentation employing the new notions on standard benchmark datasets. We describe an open-source association mining tool that embodies one of our variants of confidence boost in such a way that the data mining process does not require the user to select any value for any parameter.",0
"We show new limits on the efficiency of using current techniques to make exact probabilistic inference for large classes of natural problems. In particular we show new lower bounds on knowledge compilation to SDD and DNNF forms. We give strong lower bounds on the complexity of SDD representations by relating SDD size to best-partition communication complexity. We use this relationship to prove exponential lower bounds on the SDD size for representing a large class of problems that occur naturally as queries over probabilistic databases. A consequence is that for representing unions of conjunctive queries, SDDs are not qualitatively more concise than OBDDs. We also derive simple examples for which SDDs must be exponentially less concise than FBDDs. Finally, we derive exponential lower bounds on the sizes of DNNF representations using a new quasipolynomial simulation of DNNFs by nondeterministic FBDDs.",0

"People can refer to quantities in a visual scene by using either exact cardinals (e.g. one, two, three) or natural language quantifiers (e.g. few, most, all). In humans, these two processes underlie fairly different cognitive and neural mechanisms. Inspired by this evidence, the present study proposes two models for learning the objective meaning of cardinals and quantifiers from visual scenes containing multiple objects. We show that a model capitalizing on a 'fuzzy' measure of similarity is effective for learning quantifiers, whereas the learning of exact cardinals is better accomplished when information about number is provided.",0
"Constraint Programming (CP) users need significant expertise in order to model their problems appropriately, notably to select propagators and search strategies. This puts the brakes on a broader uptake of CP. In this paper, we introduce MICE, a complete Java CP modeler that can use any Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver as a solution technique. Our aim is to provide an alternative tool for democratizing the ""CP-style"" modeling thanks to its simplicity of use, with reasonable solving capabilities. Our contributions include new decompositions of (reified) constraints and constraints on numerical variables.",0
"Combinatorial optimization problems are typically NP-hard, and thus very challenging to solve. In this paper, we present the random key cuckoo search (RKCS) algorithm for solving the famous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We used a simplified random-key encoding scheme to pass from a continuous space (real numbers) to a combinatorial space. We also consider the displacement of a solution in both spaces using Levy flights. The performance of the proposed RKCS is tested against a set of benchmarks of symmetric TSP from the well-known TSPLIB library. The results of the tests show that RKCS is superior to some other metaheuristic algorithms.",0
"We present a hybrid constraint-based/Bayesian algorithm for learning causal networks in the presence of sparse data. The algorithm searches the space of equivalence classes of models (essential graphs) using a heuristic based on conventional constraint-based techniques. Each essential graph is then converted into a directed acyclic graph and scored using a Bayesian scoring metric. Two variants of the algorithm are developed and tested using data from randomly generated networks of sizes from 15 to 45 nodes with data sizes ranging from 250 to 2000 records. Both variations are compared to, and found to consistently outperform two variations of greedy search with restarts.",0
"Task allocation problems have traditionally focused on cost optimization. However, more and more attention is being given to cases in which cost should not always be the sole or major consideration. In this paper, we study a fair task allocation problem where an optimal allocation not only has low cost but more importantly, it is max-lexmin fair to all participants. To tackle this max-lexmin fair minimum cost allocation problem, we analyze and solve it in two parts. We first aim to determine the maximum number of jobs that can be feasibly done and the fairest distribution thereof. Since there may be many allocations that are considered equally fair, we then find the allocation with the minimum costs. We propose two novel polynomial-time algorithms that make use of the network flow structure of the problem to obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the trade-off between cost minimization and fairness.",0
"We analyze the data complexity of ontology-mediated querying where the ontologies are formulated in a description logic (DL) of the ALC family and queries are conjunctive queries, positive existential queries, or acyclic conjunctive queries. Our approach is non-uniform in the sense that we aim to understand the complexity of each single ontology instead of for all ontologies formulated in a certain language. While doing so, we quantify over the queries and are interested, for example, in the question whether all queries can be evaluated in polynomial time w.r.t. a given ontology. Our results include a PTime/coNP-dichotomy for ontologies of depth one in the description logic ALCFI, the equivalence of a PTime/coNP-dichotomy for ALC and ALCI-ontologies of unrestricted depth to the famous dichotomy conjecture for CSPs by Feder and Vardi, and the failure of PTime/coNP-dichotomy theorem for ALCF-ontologies. Regarding the latter DL, we also show that it is undecidable whether a given ontology admits PTime query evaluation.",0
"This article shows why the diffusion and peer-reviewing of research results would be more efficient, precise and relevant if all or at least some parts of the descriptions and peer-reviews of research results took the form of a fine-grained semantic network, within articles or knowledge bases, as part of the Semantic Web. This article also shows some ways this can be done and hence how research journal/proceeding publishers could allow this. So far, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not proposed simple notations and cooperation protocols - similar to those illustrated or referred to in this article - but it now seems likely that Wikipedia/Wikidata, Google or the W3C will propose them sooner or later. Then, research journal/proceeding publishers and researchers may or may not quickly use this approach.",0

"There has been a recent explosion in the capabilities of game-playing artificial intelligence. Many classes of RL tasks, from Atari games to motor control to board games, are now solvable by fairly generic algorithms, based on deep learning, that learn to play from experience with minimal knowledge of the specific domain of interest. In this work, we will investigate the performance of these methods on Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM), a popular console fighting game. The SSBM environment has complex dynamics and partial observability, making it challenging for human and machine alike. The multi-player aspect poses an additional challenge, as the vast majority of recent advances in RL have focused on single-agent environments. Nonetheless, we will show that it is possible to train agents that are competitive against and even surpass human professionals, a new result for the multi-player video game setting.",0
"In our research we investigate the output accuracy of discrete event simulation models and agent based simulation models when studying human centric complex systems. In this paper we focus on human reactive behaviour as it is possible in both modelling approaches to implement human reactive behaviour in the model by using standard methods. As a case study we have chosen the retail sector, and here in particular the operations of the fitting room in the women wear department of a large UK department store. In our case study we looked at ways of determining the efficiency of implementing new management policies for the fitting room operation through modelling the reactive behaviour of staff and customers of the department. First, we have carried out a validation experiment in which we compared the results from our models to the performance of the real system. This experiment also allowed us to establish differences in output accuracy between the two modelling methids. In a second step a multi-scenario experiment was carried out to study the behaviour of the models when they are used for the purpose of operational improvement. Overall we have found that for our case study example both discrete event simulation and agent based simulation have the same potential to support the investigation into the efficiency of implementing new management policies.",0

It is necessary to use an adapted model to simulate the human behavior in a domestic space to monitor the patient harmonically and to intervene in the necessary time. In this paper, we tackle this problem using the hierarchical hidden Markov model for representing and recognizing complex indoor activities. We propose a new grammar, called ""Home By Room Activities Language"", to facilitate the complexity of human scenarios and consider the abnormal activities.",0
"Grouping problems aim to partition a set of items into multiple mutually disjoint subsets according to some specific criterion and constraints. Grouping problems cover a large class of important combinatorial optimization problems that are generally computationally difficult. In this paper, we propose a general solution approach for grouping problems, i.e., reinforcement learning based local search (RLS), which combines reinforcement learning techniques with descent-based local search. The viability of the proposed approach is verified on a well-known representative grouping problem (graph coloring) where a very simple descent-based coloring algorithm is applied. Experimental studies on popular DIMACS and COLOR02 benchmark graphs indicate that RLS achieves competitive performances compared to a number of well-known coloring algorithms.",0
"Statistical characteristics of network traffic have attracted a significant amount of research for automated network intrusion detection, some of which looked at applications of natural statistical laws such as Zipf's law, Benford's law and the Pareto distribution. In this paper, we present the application of Benford's law to a new network flow metric ""flow size difference"", which have not been studied by other researchers, to build an unsupervised flow-based intrusion detection system (IDS). The method was inspired by our observation on a large number of TCP flow datasets where normal flows tend to follow Benford's law closely but malicious flows tend to deviate significantly from it. The proposed IDS is unsupervised so no training is needed thus can be easily deployed. It has two simple parameters with a clear semantic meaning, allowing the human operator to set and adapt their values intuitively to adjust the overall performance of the IDS. We tested the proposed IDS on one closed and two public datasets and proved its efficiency in terms of AUC (area under the ROC curve). Being a simple and fast standalone IDS itself, the proposed method can also be easily combined with other network IDSs e.g. added as an additional component into another existing IDS to enhance its performance.",0
"Providing Reinforcement Learning agents with expert advice can dramatically improve various aspects of learning. Prior work has developed teaching protocols that enable agents to learn efficiently in complex environments; many of these methods tailor the teacher's guidance to agents with a particular representation or underlying learning scheme, offering effective but specialized teaching procedures. In this work, we explore protocol programs, an agent-agnostic schema for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning. Our goal is to incorporate the beneficial properties of a human teacher into Reinforcement Learning without making strong assumptions about the inner workings of the agent. We show how to represent existing approaches such as action pruning, reward shaping, and training in simulation as special cases of our schema and conduct preliminary experiments on simple domains.",0
"Forensic science advocates the use of inference mechanisms which may be viewed as simple multi-agent protocols. An important protocol of this kind involves an agent FE (forensic expert) who communicates to a second agent TOF (trier of fact) first its value of a certain likelihood ratio with respect to its own belief state which is supposed to be captured by a probability function on FE's proposition space. Subsequently FE communicates its recently acquired confirmation that a certain evidence proposition is true. The inference part of this sort of reasoning, here referred to as likelihood ratio transfer mediated reasoning, involves TOF's revision of its own belief state, and in particular an evaluation of the resulting belief in the hypothesis proposition.",0
"Statements about entities occur everywhere, from newspapers and web pages to structured databases. Correlating references to entities across systems that use different identifiers or names for them is a widespread problem. In this paper, we show how shared knowledge between systems can be used to solve this problem. We present ""reference by description"", a formal model for resolving references. We provide some results on the conditions under which a randomly chosen entity in one system can, with high probability, be mapped to the same entity in a different system.",0
We present a novel semi-supervised approach for sequence transduction and apply it to semantic parsing. The unsupervised component is based on a generative model in which latent sentences generate the unpaired logical forms. We apply this method to a number of semantic parsing tasks focusing on domains with limited access to labelled training data and extend those datasets with synthetically generated logical forms.,1
"The representation of the knowledge needed by a robot to perform complex tasks is restricted by the limitations of perception. One possible way of overcoming this situation and designing ""knowledgeable"" robots is to rely on the interaction with the user. We propose a multi-modal interaction framework that allows to effectively acquire knowledge about the environment where the robot operates. In particular, in this paper we present a rich representation framework that can be automatically built from the metric map annotated with the indications provided by the user. Such a representation, allows then the robot to ground complex referential expressions for motion commands and to devise topological navigation plans to achieve the target locations.",0
"The rise of robotic applications has led to the generation of a huge volume of unstructured data, whereas the current cloud infrastructure was designed to process limited amounts of structured data. To address this problem, we propose a learn-memorize-recall-reduce paradigm for robotic cloud computing. The learning stage converts incoming unstructured data into structured data; the memorization stage provides effective storage for the massive amount of data; the recall stage provides efficient means to retrieve the raw data; while the reduction stage provides means to make sense of this massive amount of unstructured data with limited computing resources.",0
"Belief revision has been studied mainly with respect to background logics that are monotonic in character. In this paper we study belief revision when the underlying logic is non-monotonic instead--an inherently interesting problem that is under explored. In particular, we will focus on the revision of a body of beliefs that is represented as a logic program under the answer set semantics, while the new information is also similarly represented as a logic program. Our approach is driven by the observation that unlike in a monotonic setting where, when necessary, consistency in a revised body of beliefs is maintained by jettisoning some old beliefs, in a non-monotonic setting consistency can be restored by adding new beliefs as well. We will define a syntactic revision function and subsequently provide representation theorem for characterising it.",0
"This paper presents a model-based planner called the Probabilistic Sulu Planner or the p-Sulu Planner, which controls stochastic systems in a goal directed manner within user-specified risk bounds. The objective of the p-Sulu Planner is to allow users to command continuous, stochastic systems, such as unmanned aerial and space vehicles, in a manner that is both intuitive and safe. To this end, we first develop a new plan representation called a chance-constrained qualitative state plan (CCQSP), through which users can specify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable level of risk. An example of a CCQSP statement is go to A through B within 30 minutes, with less than 0.001% probability of failure."" We then develop the p-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to enable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper: 1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints. The first capability is to ensures that the probability of failure is bounded. The second capability is essential for the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle path planning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the p-Sulu Planner by simulations on two real-world scenarios: the path planning and scheduling of a personal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo spacecraft.",0
"A major benefit of graphical models is that most knowledge is captured in the model structure. Many models, however, produce inference problems with a lot of symmetries not reflected in the graphical structure and hence not exploitable by efficient inference techniques such as belief propagation (BP). In this paper, we present a new and simple BP algorithm, called counting BP, that exploits such additional symmetries. Starting from a given factor graph, counting BP first constructs a compressed factor graph of clusternodes and clusterfactors, corresponding to sets of nodes and factors that are indistinguishable given the evidence. Then it runs a modified BP algorithm on the compressed graph that is equivalent to running BP on the original factor graph. Our experiments show that counting BP is applicable to a variety of important AI tasks such as (dynamic) relational models and boolean model counting, and that significant efficiency gains are obtainable, often by orders of magnitude.",0
"In this paper, a possibilistic disjunctive logic programming approach for modeling uncertain, incomplete and inconsistent information is defined. This approach introduces the use of possibilistic disjunctive clauses which are able to capture incomplete information and incomplete states of a knowledge base at the same time.",0
"In recent years there has been a spate of papers describing systems for probabilisitic reasoning which do not use numerical probabilities. In some cases the simple set of values used by these systems make it impossible to predict how a probability will change or which hypothesis is most likely given certain evidence. This paper concentrates on such situations, and suggests a number of ways in which they may be resolved by refining the representation.",0
"The Collective Graphical Model (CGM) models a population of independent and identically distributed individuals when only collective statistics (i.e., counts of individuals) are observed. Exact inference in CGMs is intractable, and previous work has explored Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MAP approximations for learning and inference. This paper studies Gaussian approximations to the CGM. As the population grows large, we show that the CGM distribution converges to a multivariate Gaussian distribution (GCGM) that maintains the conditional independence properties of the original CGM. If the observations are exact marginals of the CGM or marginals that are corrupted by Gaussian noise, inference in the GCGM approximation can be computed efficiently in closed form. If the observations follow a different noise model (e.g., Poisson), then expectation propagation provides efficient and accurate approximate inference. The accuracy and speed of GCGM inference is compared to the MCMC and MAP methods on a simulated bird migration problem. The GCGM matches or exceeds the accuracy of the MAP method while being significantly faster.",1
"This paper introduces a multi-period inspector scheduling problem (MPISP), which is a new variant of the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex $A$ to a certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B. Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our approach generates high-quality solutions.",0
"Operationalization of terminology for IT applications has revived the Wusterian approach. The conceptual dimension once more prevails after taking back seat to specialised lexicography. This is demonstrated by the emergence of ontology in terminology. While the Terminology Principles as defined in Felber manual and the ISO standards remain at the core of traditional terminology, their computational implementation raises some issues. In this article, while reiterating their importance, we will be re-examining these Principles from a dual perspective: that of logic in the mathematical sense of the term and that of epistemology as in the theory of knowledge. We will thus be clarifying and describing some of them so as to take into account advances in knowledge engineering (ontology) and formal systems (logic). The notion of ontoterminology, terminology whose conceptual system is a formal ontology, results from this approach.",0
We consider the problem of efficiently computing shortest paths in weighted graphs given auxiliary data computed in an expensive offline phase. Contraction Hierarchies --- a very successful techniques on road graphs --- are extended in this work to support a three phase workflow by adding a fast weight customization phase and using nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental analysis on large road and game maps that clearly shows that Customizable Contraction Hierarchies are a very practicable solution even in scenarios where edge weights constantly change. We are able to prove a constant factor approximation bound.,0
"This paper revisits the problem of analyzing multiple ratings given by different judges. Different from previous work that focuses on distilling the true labels from noisy crowdsourcing ratings, we emphasize gaining diagnostic insights into our in-house well-trained judges. We generalize the well-known DawidSkene model (Dawid &amp; Skene, 1979) to a spectrum of probabilistic models under the same ""TrueLabel + Confusion"" paradigm, and show that our proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, called HybridConfusion, consistently outperforms DawidSkene on both synthetic and real-world data sets.",1
"Boolean factor analysis is the task of decomposing a Binary matrix to the Boolean product of two binary factors. This unsupervised data-analysis approach is desirable due to its interpretability, but hard to perform due its NP-hardness. A closely related problem is low-rank Boolean matrix completion from noisy observations. We treat these problems as maximum a posteriori inference problems, and present message passing solutions that scale linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices, in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and outperform existing techniques in real-world applications, such as large-scale binary valued collaborative filtering tasks.",1
"Bilattice-based triangle provides elegant algebraic structure for reasoning with vague and uncertain information. But the truth and knowledge ordering of intervals in bilattice-based triangle can not deal with nonmonotonic reasoning and are not always intuitive. In this work, we construct an alternative algebraic structure, namely poset-based triangle and we provide with proper logical connectives for this. It as an enhancement of the bilattice-based triangle to handle nonmonotonicity in logical reasoning.",0
"Two challenges in the theory and practice of cloud computing are: (1) smart control (allocation) of resources under exploration constraints, on time-varying systems, and (2) understanding and debugging of the performance of complex systems that involve e.g. virtualization. In this paper, we examine how these challenges can be approached using causal models. For challenge (1) we investigate how to infer and use causal models and selection diagrams to design and integrate experiments in a principled way, as well as to cope with partially varying systems. For challenge (2) we examine how to formalize performance attribution and debugging questions by counterfactual probabilities, and how to approximately answer them based on inferred (non-deterministic) graphical causal models.",0
"Rational agents are usually built to maximize rewards. However, AGI agents can find undesirable ways of maximizing any prior reward function. Therefore value learning is crucial for safe AGI. We assume that generalized states of the world are valuable - not rewards themselves, and propose an extension of AIXI, in which rewards are used only to bootstrap hierarchical value learning. The modified AIXI agent is considered in the multi-agent environment, where other agents can be either humans or other ""mature"" agents, which values should be revealed and adopted by the ""infant"" AGI agent. General framework for designing such empathic agent with ethical bias is proposed also as an extension of the universal intelligence model. Moreover, we perform experiments in the simple Markov environment, which demonstrate feasibility of our approach to value learning in safe AGI.",0
"This short report describes an automated BWAPI-based script developed for live streams of a StarCraft Brood War bot tournament, SSCAIT.

"Online reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly popular for the personalized mobile health (mHealth) intervention. It is able to personalize the type and dose of interventions according to user's ongoing statuses and changing needs. However, at the beginning of online learning, there are usually too few samples to support the RL updating, which leads to poor performances. A delay in good performance of the online learning algorithms can be especially detrimental in the mHealth, where users tend to quickly disengage with apps. To address this problem, we propose a new online RL methodology that focuses on an effective warm start. The main idea is to make full use of the data accumulated and the decision rule achieved in a former study. As a result, we can greatly enrich the data size at the beginning of online learning in our method. Such case accelerates the online learning process for new users to achieve good performances not only at the beginning of online learning but also through the whole online learning process. Besides, we use the decision rules achieved previously to initialize the parameter in our online RL model for new users. It provides a good initialization for the proposed online RL algorithm. Experiment results show that promising improvements have been achieved by our method compared with the state-of-the-art method.",0
"Description logic (DL) based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) is used routinely in medical practice. However, diagnostic inference using such terminology is precluded by its complexity. Here we propose a model that simplifies these inferential components. We propose three concepts that classify clinical features and examined their effect on inference using SNOMED CT. We used PAIRS (Physician Assistant Artificial Intelligence Reference System) database (1964 findings for 485 disorders, 18 397 disease feature links) for our analysis. We also use a 50-million medical word corpus for estimating the vectors of disease-feature links. Our major results are 10% of finding-disorder links are concomitant in both assertion and negation where as 90% are either concomitant in assertion or negation. Logical implications of PAIRS data on SNOMED CT include 70% of the links do not share any common system while 18% share organ and 12% share both system and organ. Applications of these principles for inference are discussed and suggestions are made for deriving a diagnostic process using SNOMED CT. Limitations of these processes and suggestions for improvements are also discussed.",0
"In this paper, we investigate bounded action theories in the situation calculus. A bounded action theory is one which entails that, in every situation, the number of object tuples in the extension of fluents is bounded by a given constant, although such extensions are in general different across the infinitely many situations. We argue that such theories are common in applications, either because facts do not persist indefinitely or because the agent eventually forgets some facts, as new ones are learnt. We discuss various classes of bounded action theories. Then we show that verification of a powerful first-order variant of the mu-calculus is decidable for such theories. Notably, this variant supports a controlled form of quantification across situations. We also show that through verification, we can actually check whether an arbitrary action theory maintains boundedness.",0
"Enforcing local consistencies is one of the main features of constraint reasoning. Which level of local consistency should be used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic question. Arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have been widely studied, and have been known for sometime through the forward checking or the MAC search algorithms. Until recently, stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that change the structure of the constraint graph, and thus, could not be used in practice, especially on large networks. This paper focuses on the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency, without changing the structure of the network, i.e., only removing inconsistent values from the domains. In the last five years, several such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others. We make an overview of all of them, and highlight some relations between them. We compare them both theoretically and experimentally, considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce them.",0
"The Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) is one of the metaheuristics algorithms that most widely used to solve optimization problems. The BFO is imitated from the behavior of the foraging bacteria group such as Ecoli. The main aim of algorithm is to eliminate those bacteria that have weak foraging methods and maintaining those bacteria that have strong foraging methods. In this extent, each bacterium communicates with other bacteria by sending signals such that bacterium change the position in the next step if prior factors have been satisfied. In fact, the process of algorithm allows bacteria to follow up nutrients toward the optimal. In this paper, the BFO is used for the solutions of Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and multi- objective QAP (mQAP) by using updating mechanisms including mutation, crossover, and a local search.",0
"Classical Decision Theory provides a normative framework for representing and reasoning about complex preferences. Straightforward application of this theory to automate decision making is difficult due to high elicitation cost. In response to this problem, researchers have recently developed a number of qualitative, logic-oriented approaches for representing and reasoning about references. While effectively addressing some expressiveness issues, these logics have not proven powerful enough for building practical automated decision making systems. In this paper we present a hybrid approach to preference elicitation and decision making that is grounded in classical multi-attribute utility theory, but can make effective use of the expressive power of qualitative approaches. Specifically, assuming a partially specified multilinear utility function, we show how comparative statements about classes of decision alternatives can be used to further constrain the utility function and thus identify sup-optimal alternatives. This work demonstrates that quantitative and qualitative approaches can be synergistically integrated to provide effective and flexible decision support.",0
"In our recent paper we have established close relationships between state reduction of a fuzzy recognizer and resolution of a particular system of fuzzy relation equations. In that paper we have also studied reductions by means of those solutions which are fuzzy equivalences. In this paper we will see that in some cases better reductions can be obtained using the solutions of this system that are fuzzy quasi-orders. Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers. We also demonstrate some applications of weakly left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders in conflict analysis of fuzzy discrete event systems.",0
"Our work concerns the elucidation of the cancer (epi)genome, transcriptome and proteome to better understand the complex interplay between a cancer cell's molecular state and its response to anti-cancer therapy. To study the problem, we have previously focused on data warehousing technologies and statistical data integration. In this paper, we present recent work on extending our analytical capabilities using Semantic Web technology. A key new component presented here is a SPARQL endpoint to our existing data warehouse. This endpoint allows the merging of observed quantitative data with existing data from semantic knowledge sources such as Gene Ontology (GO). We show how such variegated quantitative and functional data can be integrated and accessed in a universal manner using Semantic Web tools. We also demonstrate how Description Logic (DL) reasoning can be used to infer previously unstated conclusions from existing knowledge bases. As proof of concept, we illustrate the ability of our setup to answer complex queries on resistance of cancer cells to Decitabine, a demethylating agent.",0
"We analyze the structure of the state space of chess by means of transition path sampling Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the typical number of moves required to transpose a given configuration of chess pieces into another, we conclude that the state space consists of several pockets between which transitions are rare. Skilled players explore an even smaller subset of positions that populate some of these pockets only very sparsely. These results suggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space and the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the complexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally important.",0
"We have a lot of relation to the encoding and the Theory of Information, when considering thinking. This is a natural process and, at once, the complex thing we investigate. This always was a challenge - to understand how our mind works, and we are trying to find some universal models for this. A lot of ways have been considered so far, but we are looking for Something, we seek for approaches. And the goal is to find a consistent, noncontradictory view, which should at once be enough flexible in any dimensions to allow to represent various kinds of processes and environments, matters of different nature and diverse objects. Developing of such a model is the destination of this article.",0
"In this work, we take a fresh look at some old and new algorithms for off-policy, return-based reinforcement learning. Expressing these in a common form, we derive a novel algorithm, Retrace($\lambda$), with three desired properties: (1) low variance; (2) safety, as it safely uses samples collected from any behaviour policy, whatever its degree of ""off-policyness""; and (3) efficiency, as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy behaviour policies. We analyse the contractive nature of the related operator under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online sample-based algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first return-based off-policy control algorithm converging a.s. to $Q^*$ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary, we prove the convergence of Watkins' Q($\lambda$), which was still an open problem. We illustrate the benefits of Retrace($\lambda$) on a standard suite of Atari 2600 games.",1
"We study a framework where agents have to avoid aversive signals. The agents are given only partial information, in the form of features that are projections of task states. Additionally, the agents have to cope with non-determinism, defined as unpredictability on the way that actions are executed. The goal of each agent is to define its behavior based on feature-action pairs that reliably avoid aversive signals. We study a learning algorithm, called A-learning, that exhibits fixpoint convergence, where the belief of the allowed feature-action pairs eventually becomes fixed. A-learning is parameter-free and easy to implement.",0
"We present an online deliberation system using mutual evaluation in order to collaboratively develop solutions. Participants submit their proposals and evaluate each other's proposals; some of them may then be invited by the system to rewrite 'problematic' proposals. Two cases are discussed: a proposal supported by many, but not by a given person, who is then invited to rewrite it for making yet more acceptable; and a poorly presented but presumably interesting proposal. The first of these cases has been successfully implemented. Proposals are evaluated along two axes-understandability (or clarity, or, more generally, quality), and agreement. The latter is used by the system to cluster proposals according to their ideas, while the former is used both to present the best proposals on top of their clusters, and to find poorly written proposals candidates for rewriting. These functionalities may be considered as important components of a large scale online deliberation system.",0
"The continuous increase in the availability of data of any kind, coupled with the development of networks of high-speed communications, the popularization of cloud computing and the growth of data centers and the emergence of high-performance computing does essential the task to develop techniques that allow more efficient data processing and analyzing of large volumes datasets and extraction of valuable information. In the following pages we will discuss about development of this field in recent decades, and its potential and applicability present in the various branches of scientific research. Also, we try to review briefly the different families of algorithms that are included in data mining research area, its scalability with increasing dimensionality of the input data and how they can be addressed and what behavior different methods in a scenario in which the information is distributed or decentralized processed so as to increment performance optimization in heterogeneous environments.",0
"Majority of the existing robot navigation systems, which facilitate the use of laser range finders, sonar sensors or artificial landmarks, has the ability to locate itself in an unknown environment and then build a map of the corresponding environment. Stereo vision, while still being a rapidly developing technique in the field of autonomous mobile robots, are currently less preferable due to its high implementation cost. This paper aims at describing an experimental approach for the building of a stereo vision system that helps the robots to avoid obstacles and navigate through indoor environments and at the same time remaining very much cost effective. This paper discusses the fusion techniques of stereo vision and ultrasound sensors which helps in the successful navigation through different types of complex environments. The data from the sensor enables the robot to create the two dimensional topological map of unknown environments and stereo vision systems models the three dimension model of the same environment.",0
"Traffic is the chief puzzle problem which every country faces because of the enhancement in number of vehicles throughout the world, especially in large urban towns. Hence the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic control algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. Fuzzy optimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex simulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB simulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in isolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue length of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the other phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase difference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and queue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of two alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue length and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value of waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity sensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the intersection. An intelligent traffic model and fuzzy logic traffic controller are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controller under different pre-defined conditions for oleaginous flow of traffic. Additionally, this fuzzy logic traffic controller has emergency vehicle siren sensors which detect emergency vehicle movement like ambulance, fire brigade, Police Van etc. and gives maximum priority to him and pass preferred signal to it.",0
"The Model Checking Integrated Planning System (MIPS) is a temporal least commitment heuristic search planner based on a flexible object-oriented workbench architecture. Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures. MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules. As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance. The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans. The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled. One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries. The latter aspect is analyzed in detail. MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.",0
"Abstractions are essential when a person performs intellectual tasks. In this case, however, abstractions are either ideas or depend on ideas in the mind of the person, making them unsuitable for mechanical manipulation. In spite of this, it is possible to define abstractions that can be processed entirely through a mechanical process. In this paper, I introduce these computable abstractions and the mechanical abstractional process that deals with them, opening the possibility for machines to perform intellectual tasks with results that are intuitively comparable to humans results.",0
"It was shown before that the NP-hard problem of deterministic finite automata (DFA) identification can be effectively translated to Boolean satisfiability (SAT). Modern SAT-solvers can tackle hard DFA identification instances efficiently. We present a technique to reduce the problem search space by enforcing an enumeration of DFA states in depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) order. We propose symmetry breaking predicates, which can be added to Boolean formulae representing various DFA identification problems. We show how to apply this technique to DFA identification from both noiseless and noisy data. Also we propose a method to identify all automata of the desired size. The proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art DFASAT method for DFA identification from noiseless data. A big advantage of the proposed approach is that it allows to determine exactly the existence or non-existence of a solution of the noisy DFA identification problem unlike metaheuristic approaches such as genetic algorithms.",0
"High precision assembly of mechanical parts requires accuracy exceeding the robot precision. Conventional part mating methods used in the current manufacturing requires tedious tuning of numerous parameters before deployment. We show how the robot can successfully perform a tight clearance peg-in-hole task through training a recurrent neural network with reinforcement learning. In addition to saving the manual effort, the proposed technique also shows robustness against position and angle errors for the peg-in-hole task. The neural network learns to take the optimal action by observing the robot sensors to estimate the system state. The advantages of our proposed method is validated experimentally on a 7-axis articulated robot arm.",0
"For most branching algorithms in Boolean logic ""branching"" means ""variable-wise branching"". We present the apparently novel technique of clause-wise branching, which is used to solve the ALLSAT problem for arbitrary Boolean functions in CNF format. Specifically, it converts a CNF into an orthogonal DNF, i.e. into an exclusive sum of products. Our method is enhanced by two ingredients: The use of a good SAT-solver and wildcards beyond the common don't-care symbol.",0
"Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a crucial problem and has applications in many research areas. PC algorithm is the state-of-the-art method in the constraint based approach. However, the PC algorithm is worst-case exponential to the number of nodes (variables), and thus it is inefficient when applying to high dimensional data, e.g. gene expression datasets where the causal relationships between thousands of nodes (genes) are explored. In this paper, we propose a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel computing technique. We apply our method on a range of synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from DREAM 5 challenge show that the PC algorithm could not produce any results after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm with a 4-core CPU computer managed to finish within around 12.5 hours, and less than 6 hours with a 8-core CPU computer.",0
"Causality has been recently introduced in databases, to model, characterize, and possibly compute causes for query answers. Connections between QA-causality and consistency-based diagnosis and database repairs (wrt. integrity constraint violations) have already been established. In this work we establish precise connections between QA-causality and both abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem in databases, allowing us to obtain new algorithmic and complexity results for QA-causality. We also obtain new results on the complexity of view-conditioned causality, and investigate the notion of QA-causality in the presence of integrity constraints, obtaining complexity results from a connection with view-conditioned causality. The abduction connection under integrity constraints allows us to obtain algorithmic tools for QA-causality.",0
"This paper proposes a new general approach based on Bayesian networks to model the human behaviour. This approach represents human behaviour with probabilistic cause-effect relations based on knowledge, but also with conditional probabilities coming either from knowledge or deduced from observations. This approach has been applied to the co-simulation of the CO2 concentration in an office coupled with human behaviour.",0
"Nanson's and Baldwin's voting rules select a winner by successively eliminating candidates with low Borda scores. We show that these rules have a number of desirable computational properties. In particular, with unweighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with one manipulator, whilst with weighted votes, it is NP-hard to manipulate either rule with a small number of candidates and a coalition of manipulators. As only a couple of other voting rules are known to be NP-hard to manipulate with a single manipulator, Nanson's and Baldwin's rules appear to be particularly resistant to manipulation from a theoretical perspective. We also propose a number of approximation methods for manipulating these two rules. Experiments demonstrate that both rules are often difficult to manipulate in practice. These results suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study.",1
"Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) perform wastewater treatment and electricity production through the conversion of organic matter using microorganisms. For practical applications, it has been suggested that greater efficiency can be achieved by arranging multiple MFC units into physical stacks in a cascade with feedstock flowing sequentially between units. In this paper, we investigate the use of computational intelligence to physically explore and optimise (potentially) heterogeneous MFC designs in a cascade, i.e. without simulation. Conductive structures are 3-D printed and inserted into the anodic chamber of each MFC unit, augmenting a carbon fibre veil anode and affecting the hydrodynamics, including the feedstock volume and hydraulic retention time, as well as providing unique habitats for microbial colonisation. We show that it is possible to use design mining to identify new conductive inserts that increase both the cascade power output and power density.",0
"We explore the issue of refining an existent Bayesian network structure using new data which might mention only a subset of the variables. Most previous works have only considered the refinement of the network's conditional probability parameters, and have not addressed the issue of refining the network's structure. We develop a new approach for refining the network's structure. Our approach is based on the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle, and it employs an adapted version of a Bayesian network learning algorithm developed in our previous work. One of the adaptations required is to modify the previous algorithm to account for the structure of the existent network. The learning algorithm generates a partial network structure which can then be used to improve the existent network. We also present experimental evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"We propose a framework grounded in Logic Programming for representing and reasoning about business processes from both the procedural and ontological point of views. In particular, our goal is threefold: (1) define a logical language and a formal semantics for process models enriched with ontology-based annotations; (2) provide an effective inference mechanism that supports the combination of reasoning services dealing with the structural definition of a process model, its behavior, and the domain knowledge related to the participating business entities; (3) implement such a theoretical framework into a process modeling and reasoning platform. To this end we define a process ontology coping with a relevant fragment of the popular BPMN modeling notation. The behavioral semantics of a process is defined as a state transition system by following an approach similar to the Fluent Calculus, and allows us to specify state change in terms of preconditions and effects of the enactment of activities. Then we show how the procedural process knowledge can be seamlessly integrated with the domain knowledge specified by using the OWL 2 RL rule-based ontology language. Our framework provides a wide range of reasoning services, including CTL model checking, which can be performed by using standard Logic Programming inference engines through a goal-oriented, efficient, sound and complete evaluation procedure. We also present a software environment implementing the proposed framework, and we report on an experimental evaluation of the system, whose results are encouraging and show the viability of the approach.",0
"Given recent successes in AI (e.g., AlphaGo's victory against Lee Sedol in the game of GO), it's become increasingly important to assess: how close are AI systems to human-level intelligence?

"Self-paced learning (SPL) is a new methodology that simulates the learning principle of humans/animals to start learning easier aspects of a learning task, and then gradually take more complex examples into training. This new-coming learning regime has been empirically substantiated to be effective in various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Recently, it has been proved that the SPL regime has a close relationship to a implicit self-paced objective function. While this implicit objective could provide helpful interpretations to the effectiveness, especially the robustness, insights under the SPL paradigms, there are still no theoretical results strictly proved to verify such relationship. To this issue, in this paper, we provide some convergence results on this implicit objective of SPL. Specifically, we prove that the learning process of SPL always converges to critical points of this implicit objective under some mild conditions. This result verifies the intrinsic relationship between SPL and this implicit objective, and makes the previous robustness analysis on SPL complete and theoretically rational.",0
"The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has re-energized research into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of domain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to terms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure of the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by aligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we stand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad reading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally optimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This follows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate data, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an inductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers performance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may posit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of its environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this agent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative environments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment as being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is obviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we further constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI in terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of this is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the statistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.",0
Intersections constitute one of the most dangerous elements in road systems. Traffic signals remain the most common way to control traffic at high-volume intersections and offer many opportunities to apply intelligent transportation systems to make traffic more efficient and safe. This paper describes an automated method to estimate the temporal exposure of road users crossing the conflict zone to lateral collision with road users originating from a different approach. This component is part of a larger system relying on video sensors to provide queue lengths and spatial occupancy that are used for real time traffic control and monitoring. The method is evaluated on data collected during a real world experiment.,0
"The potential use of non-linear speech features has not been investigated for music analysis although other commonly used speech features like Mel Frequency Ceptral Coefficients (MFCC) and pitch have been used extensively. In this paper, we assume an audio signal to be a sum of modulated sinusoidal and then use the energy separation algorithm to decompose the audio into amplitude and frequency modulation components using the non-linear Teager-Kaiser energy operator. We first identify the distribution of these non-linear features for music only and voice only segments in the audio signal in different Mel spaced frequency bands and show that they have the ability to discriminate. The proposed method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence measure is evaluated using a set of Indian classical songs from three different artists. Experimental results show that the discrimination ability is evident in certain low and mid frequency bands (200 - 1500 Hz).",0
"With the aim of studying social properties of belief merging and having a better understanding of impossibility, we extend in three ways the framework of logic-based merging introduced by Konieczny and Pino P\'erez. First, at the level of representation of the information, we pass from belief bases to complex epistemic states. Second, the profiles are represented as functions of finite societies to the set of epistemic states (a sort of vectors) and not as multisets of epistemic states. Third, we extend the set of rational postulates in order to consider the epistemic versions of the classical postulates of Social Choice Theory: Standard Domain, Pareto Property, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives and Absence of Dictator. These epistemic versions of social postulates are given, essentially, in terms of the finite propositional logic. We state some representation theorems for these operators. These extensions and representation theorems allow us to establish an epistemic and very general version of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. One of the interesting features of our result, is that it holds for different representations of epistemic states; for instance conditionals, Ordinal Conditional functions and, of course, total preorders.",0
"Memetic computation (MC) has emerged recently as a new paradigm of efficient algorithms for solving the hardest optimization problems. On the other hand, artificial bees colony (ABC) algorithms demonstrate good performances when solving continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This study tries to use these technologies under the same roof. As a result, a memetic ABC (MABC) algorithm has been developed that is hybridized with two local search heuristics: the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NMA) and the random walk with direction exploitation (RWDE). The former is attended more towards exploration, while the latter more towards exploitation of the search space. The stochastic adaptation rule was employed in order to control the balancing between exploration and exploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large Scale Continuous Global Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. The obtained results the MABC are comparable with the results of DECC-G, DECC-G*, and MLCC.",0
"Making high-quality decisions in strategic spatial planning is heavily dependent on extracting knowledge from vast amounts of data. Although many decision-making problems like developing urban areas require such perception and reasoning, existing methods in this field usually neglect the deep knowledge mined from geographic databases and are based on pure statistical methods. Due to the large volume of data gathered in spatial databases, and the uncertainty of spatial objects, mining association rules for high-level knowledge representation is a challenging task. Few algorithms manage geographical and non-geographical data using topological relations. In this paper, a novel approach for spatial data mining based on the MOSES evolutionary framework is presented which improves the classic genetic programming approach. A hybrid architecture called GGeo is proposed to apply the MOSES mining rules considering fuzzy topological relations from spatial data. The uncertainty and fuzziness aspects are addressed using an enriched model of topological relations by fuzzy region connection calculus. Moreover, to overcome the problem of time-consuming fuzzy topological relationships calculations, this a novel data pre-processing method is offered. GGeo analyses and learns from geographical and non-geographical data and uses topological and distance parameters, and returns a series of arithmetic-spatial formulas as classification rules. The proposed approach is resistant to noisy data, and all its stages run in parallel to increase speed. This approach may be used in different spatial data classification problems as well as representing an appropriate method of data analysis and economic policy making.",0
"Two-timescale Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithms are widely used in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In such methods, the iterates consist of two parts that are updated using different stepsizes.

We apply our methodology to two-timescale RL algorithms such as GTD(0), GTD2, and TDC.",0
"Artificial immune systems (AISs) to date have generally been inspired by naive biological metaphors. This has limited the effectiveness of these systems. In this position paper two ways in which AISs could be made more biologically realistic are discussed. We propose that AISs should draw their inspiration from organisms which possess only innate immune systems, and that AISs should employ systemic models of the immune system to structure their overall design. An outline of plant and invertebrate immune systems is presented, and a number of contemporary research that more biologically-realistic AISs could have is also discussed.",0
"We consider probabilistic inference in general hybrid networks, which include continuous and discrete variables in an arbitrary topology. We reexamine the question of variable discretization in a hybrid network aiming at minimizing the information loss induced by the discretization. We show that a nonuniform partition across all variables as opposed to uniform partition of each variable separately reduces the size of the data structures needed to represent a continuous function. We also provide a simple but efficient procedure for nonuniform partition. To represent a nonuniform discretization in the computer memory, we introduce a new data structure, which we call a Binary Split Partition (BSP) tree. We show that BSP trees can be an exponential factor smaller than the data structures in the standard uniform discretization in multiple dimensions and show how the BSP trees can be used in the standard join tree algorithm. We show that the accuracy of the inference process can be significantly improved by adjusting discretization with evidence. We construct an iterative anytime algorithm that gradually improves the quality of the discretization and the accuracy of the answer on a query. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm converges.",0
"The multilingual nature of the world makes translation a crucial requirement today. Parallel dictionaries constructed by humans are a widely-available resource, but they are limited and do not provide enough coverage for good quality translation purposes, due to out-of-vocabulary words and neologisms. This motivates the use of statistical translation systems, which are unfortunately dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. Such has a very limited availability especially for some languages and very narrow text domains. Is this research we present our improvements to Yalign mining methodology by reimplementing the comparison algorithm, introducing a tuning scripts and by improving performance using GPU computing acceleration. The experiments are conducted on various text domains and bi-data is extracted from the Wikipedia dumps.",0

"Achieving joint objectives by teams of cooperative planning agents requires significant coordination and communication efforts. For a single-agent system facing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair the failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms of time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication complexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication overhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in decentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint objectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower communication overhead than replanning from scratch.",0
"Inferring probabilistic networks from data is a notoriously difficult task. Under various goodness-of-fit measures, finding an optimal network is NP-hard, even if restricted to polytrees of bounded in-degree. Polynomial-time algorithms are known only for rare special cases, perhaps most notably for branchings, that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most one. Here, we study the complexity of finding an optimal polytree that can be turned into a branching by deleting some number of arcs or nodes, treated as a parameter.",1
"The recent adaptation of deep neural network-based methods to reinforcement learning and planning domains has yielded remarkable progress on individual tasks. Nonetheless, progress on task-to-task transfer remains limited. In pursuit of efficient and robust generalization, we introduce the Schema Network, an object-oriented generative physics simulator capable of disentangling multiple causes of events and reasoning backward through causes to achieve goals. The richly structured architecture of the Schema Network can learn the dynamics of an environment directly from data. We compare Schema Networks with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic and Progressive Networks on a suite of Breakout variations, reporting results on training efficiency and zero-shot generalization, consistently demonstrating faster, more robust learning and better transfer. We argue that generalizing from limited data and learning causal relationships are essential abilities on the path toward generally intelligent systems.",1
"\emph{Discrimination discovery} from data is an important task aiming at identifying patterns of illegal and unethical discriminatory activities against protected-by-law groups, e.g.,~ethnic minorities.

"A network embedding is a representation of a large graph in a low-dimensional space, where vertices are modeled as vectors. The objective of a good embedding is to preserve the proximity between vertices in the original graph.

Existing network embedding techniques focus on homogeneous networks, where all vertices are considered to belong to a single class.",0
"The popularity of image sharing on social media reflects the important role visual context plays in everyday conversation. In this paper, we present a novel task, Image-Grounded Conversations (IGC), in which natural-sounding conversations are generated about shared photographic images. We investigate this task using training data derived from image-grounded conversations on social media and introduce a new dataset of crowd-sourced conversations for benchmarking progress. Experiments using deep neural network models trained on social media data show that the combination of visual and textual context can enhance the quality of generated conversational turns. In human evaluation, a gap between human performance and that of both neural and retrieval architectures suggests that IGC presents an interesting challenge for vision and language research.",0
"Causal discovery studies the problem of mining causal relationships between variables from data, which is of primary interest in science. During the past decades, significant amount of progresses have been made toward this fundamental data mining paradigm. Recent years, as the availability of abundant large-sized and complex observational data, the constrain-based approaches have gradually attracted a lot of interest and have been widely applied to many diverse real-world problems due to the fast running speed and easy generalizing to the problem of causal insufficiency. In this paper, we aim to review the constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. Firstly, we discuss the learning paradigm of the constraint-based approaches. Secondly and primarily, the state-of-the-art constraint-based casual inference algorithms are surveyed with the detailed analysis. Thirdly, several related open-source software packages and benchmark data repositories are briefly summarized. As a conclusion, some open problems in constraint-based causal discovery are outlined for future research.",0
"In order to perform complex actions in human environments, an autonomous robot needs the ability to understand the environment, that is, to gather and maintain spatial knowledge. Topological map is commonly used for representing large scale, global maps such as floor plans. Although much work has been done in topological map extraction, we have found little previous work on the problem of learning the topological map using a probabilistic model. Learning a topological map means learning the structure of the large-scale space and dependency between places, for example, how the evidence of a group of places influence the attributes of other places. This is an important step towards planning complex actions in the environment. In this thesis, we consider the problem of using probabilistic deep learning model to learn the topological map, which is essentially a sparse undirected graph where nodes represent places annotated with their semantic attributes (e.g. place category). We propose to use a novel probabilistic deep model, Sum-Product Networks (SPNs), due to their unique properties. We present two methods for learning topological maps using SPNs: the place grid method and the template-based method. We contribute an algorithm that builds SPNs for graphs using template models. Our experiments evaluate the ability of our models to enable robots to infer semantic attributes and detect maps with novel semantic attribute arrangements. Our results demonstrate their understanding of the topological map structure and spatial relations between places.",0
"This paper presents a systematic survey on existing literature and seminal works relevant to the application of ontologies in different aspects of Cloud computing. Our hypothesis is that ontologies along with their reasoning capabilities can have significant impact on improving various aspects of the Cloud computing phenomena. Ontologies can promote intelligent decision support mechanisms for various Cloud based services. They can also provide effective interoperability among the Cloud based systems and resources. This survey can promote a comprehensive understanding on the roles and significance of ontologies within the overall domain of Cloud Computing. Also, this project can potentially form the basis of new research area and possibilities for both ontology and Cloud computing communities.",0
"Transfer in reinforcement learning refers to the notion that generalization should occur not only within a task but also across tasks. Our focus is on transfer where the reward functions vary across tasks while the environment's dynamics remain the same. The method we propose rests on two key ideas: ""successor features,"" a value function representation that decouples the dynamics of the environment from the rewards, and ""generalized policy improvement,"" a generalization of dynamic programming's policy improvement step that considers a set of policies rather than a single one. Put together, the two ideas lead to an approach that integrates seamlessly within the reinforcement learning framework and allows transfer to take place between tasks without any restriction. The proposed method also provides performance guarantees for the transferred policy even before any learning has taken place. We derive two theorems that set our approach in firm theoretical ground and present experiments that show that it successfully promotes transfer in practice.",1
"Hybrid Probabilistic Programs (HPPs) are logic programs that allow the programmer to explicitly encode his knowledge of the dependencies between events being described in the program. In this paper, we classify HPPs into three classes called HPP_1,HPP_2 and HPP_r,r&gt;= 3. For these classes, we provide three types of results for HPPs. First, we develop algorithms to compute the set of all ground consequences of an HPP. Then we provide algorithms and complexity results for the problems of entailment (""Given an HPP P and a query Q as input, is Q a logical consequence of P?"") and consistency (""Given an HPP P as input, is P consistent?""). Our results provide a fine characterization of when polynomial algorithms exist for the above problems, and when these problems become intractable.",0
"We extend the $ASPIC^+$ framework for structured argumentation so as to allow applications of the reasoning by cases inference scheme for defeasible arguments. Given an argument with conclusion `$A$ or $B$', an argument based on $A$ with conclusion $C$, and an argument based on $B$ with conclusion $C$, we allow the construction of an argument with conclusion $C$. We show how our framework leads to different results than other approaches in non-monotonic logic for dealing with disjunctive information, such as disjunctive default theory or approaches based on the OR-rule (which allows to derive a defeasible rule `If ($A$ or $B$) then $C$', given two defeasible rules `If $A$ then $C$' and `If $B$ then $C$'). We raise new questions regarding the subtleties of reasoning defeasibly with disjunctive information, and show that its formalization is more intricate than one would presume.",0
"This paper contributes a novel embedding model which measures the probability of each belief $\langle h,r,t,m\rangle$ in a large-scale knowledge repository via simultaneously learning distributed representations for entities ($h$ and $t$), relations ($r$), and the words in relation mentions ($m$). It facilitates knowledge completion by means of simple vector operations to discover new beliefs. Given an imperfect belief, we can not only infer the missing entities, predict the unknown relations, but also tell the plausibility of the belief, just leveraging the learnt embeddings of remaining evidences. To demonstrate the scalability and the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on several large-scale repositories which contain millions of beliefs from WordNet, Freebase and NELL, and compare it with other cutting-edge approaches via competing the performances assessed by the tasks of entity inference, relation prediction and triplet classification with respective metrics. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts with significant improvements.",0
"This book discusses computational curiosity, from the psychology of curiosity to the computational models of curiosity, and then showcases several interesting applications of computational curiosity. A brief overview of the book is given as follows. Chapter 1 discusses the underpinnings of curiosity in human beings, including the major categories of curiosity, curiosity-related emotions and behaviors, and the benefits of curiosity. Chapter 2 reviews the arousal theories of curiosity in psychology and summarizes a general two-step process model for computational curiosity. Base on the perspective of the two-step process model, Chapter 3 reviews and analyzes some of the traditional computational models of curiosity. Chapter 4 introduces a novel generic computational model of curiosity, which is developed based on the arousal theories of curiosity. After the discussion of computational models of curiosity, we outline the important applications where computational curiosity may bring significant impacts in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 discusses the application of the generic computational model of curiosity in a machine learning framework. Chapter 7 discusses the application of the generic computational model of curiosity in a recommender system. In Chapter 8 and Chapter 9, the generic computational model of curiosity is studied in two types of pedagogical agents. In Chapter 8, a curious peer learner is studied. It is a non-player character that aims to provide a believable virtual learning environment for users. In Chapter 9, a curious learning companion is studied. It aims to enhance users' learning experience through providing meaningful interactions with them. Chapter 10 discusses open questions in the research field of computation curiosity.",0
"On the one hand, classical terminological knowledge representation excludes the possibility of handling uncertain concept descriptions involving, e.g., ""usually true"" concept properties, generalized quantifiers, or exceptions. On the other hand, purely numerical approaches for handling uncertainty in general are unable to consider terminological knowledge. This paper presents the language ACP which is a probabilistic extension of terminological logics and aims at closing the gap between the two areas of research. We present the formal semantics underlying the language ALUP and introduce the probabilistic formalism that is based on classes of probabilities and is realized by means of probabilistic constraints. Besides inferring implicitly existent probabilistic relationships, the constraints guarantee terminological and probabilistic consistency. Altogether, the new language ALUP applies to domains where both term descriptions and uncertainty have to be handled.",0

"Open world games present players with more freedom than games with linear progression structures. However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.",0
"We address the problem of localizing non-collaborative WiFi devices in a large region. Our main motive is to localize humans by localizing their WiFi devices, e.g. during search-and-rescue operations after a natural disaster. We use an active sensing approach that relies on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to collect signal-strength measurements at informative locations. The problem is challenging since the measurement is received at arbitrary times and they are received only when the UAV is in close proximity to the device. For these reasons, it is extremely important to make prudent decision with very few measurements. We use the Bayesian optimization approach based on Gaussian process (GP) regression. This approach works well for our application since GPs give reliable predictions with very few measurements while Bayesian optimization makes a judicious trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In field experiments conducted over a region of 1000 $\times$ 1000 $m^2$, we show that our approach reduces the search area to less than 100 meters around the WiFi device within 5 minutes only. Overall, our approach localizes the device in less than 15 minutes with an error of less than 20 meters.",0
"In this work, a new prototype-based clustering method named Evidential C-Medoids (ECMdd), which belongs to the family of medoid-based clustering for proximity data, is proposed as an extension of Fuzzy C-Medoids (FCMdd) on the theoretical framework of belief functions. In the application of FCMdd and original ECMdd, a single medoid (prototype), which is supposed to belong to the object set, is utilized to represent one class. For the sake of clarity, this kind of ECMdd using a single medoid is denoted by sECMdd. In real clustering applications, using only one pattern to capture or interpret a class may not adequately model different types of group structure and hence limits the clustering performance. In order to address this problem, a variation of ECMdd using multiple weighted medoids, denoted by wECMdd, is presented. Unlike sECMdd, in wECMdd objects in each cluster carry various weights describing their degree of representativeness for that class. This mechanism enables each class to be represented by more than one object. Experimental results in synthetic and real data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of sECMdd and wECMdd. Moreover, the clustering results by wECMdd can provide richer information for the inner structure of the detected classes with the help of prototype weights.",0
This paper develops an inconsistency measure on conditional probabilistic knowledge bases. The measure is based on fundamental principles for inconsistency measures and thus provides a solid theoretical framework for the treatment of inconsistencies in probabilistic expert systems. We illustrate its usefulness and immediate application on several examples and present some formal results. Building on this measure we use the Shapley value-a well-known solution for coalition games-to define a sophisticated indicator that is not only able to measure inconsistencies but to reveal the causes of inconsistencies in the knowledge base. Altogether these tools guide the knowledge engineer in his aim to restore consistency and therefore enable him to build a consistent and usable knowledge base that can be employed in probabilistic expert systems.,0

"To investigate the robustness of the output probabilities of a Bayesian network, a sensitivity analysis can be performed. A one-way sensitivity analysis establishes, for each of the probability parameters of a network, a function expressing a posterior marginal probability of interest in terms of the parameter. Current methods for computing the coefficients in such a function rely on a large number of network evaluations. In this paper, we present a method that requires just a single outward propagation in a junction tree for establishing the coefficients in the functions for all possible parameters; in addition, an inward propagation is required for processing evidence. Conversely, the method requires a single outward propagation for computing the coefficients in the functions expressing all possible posterior marginals in terms of a single parameter. We extend these results to an n-way sensitivity analysis in which sets of parameters are studied.",0
"In various areas of computer science, the problem of dealing with a set of constraints arises. If the set of constraints is unsatisfiable, one may ask for a minimal description of the reason for this unsatisifi- ability. Minimal unsatisifable subsets (MUSes) and maximal satisifiable subsets (MSSes) are two kinds of such minimal descriptions. The goal of this work is the enumeration of MUSes and MSSes for a given constraint system. As such full enumeration may be intractable in general, we focus on building an online algorithm, which produces MUSes/MSSes in an on-the-fly manner as soon as they are discovered. The problem has been studied before even in its online version. However, our algorithm uses a novel approach that is able to outperform current state-of-the art algorithms for online MUS/MSS enumeration. Moreover, the performance of our algorithm can be adjusted using tunable parameters. We evaluate the algorithm on a set of benchmarks.",0
"Decision making whenever and wherever it is happened is key to organizations success. In order to make correct decision, individuals, teams and organizations need both knowledge management (to manage content) and collaboration (to manage group processes) to make that more effective and efficient. In this paper, we explain the knowledge management and collaboration convergence. Then, we propose a formal description of mixed and multimodal decision making (MDM) process where decision may be made by three possible modes: individual, collective or hybrid. Finally, we explicit the MDM process based on UML-G profile.",0
"In previous work cite{Ha98:Towards} we presented a case-based approach to eliciting and reasoning with preferences. A key issue in this approach is the definition of similarity between user preferences. We introduced the probabilistic distance as a measure of similarity on user preferences, and provided an algorithm to compute the distance between two partially specified {em value} functions. This is for the case of decision making under {em certainty}. In this paper we address the more challenging issue of computing the probabilistic distance in the case of decision making under{em uncertainty}. We provide an algorithm to compute the probabilistic distance between two partially specified {em utility} functions. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm with a medical data set of partially specified patient preferences,where none of the other existing distancemeasures appear definable. Using this data set, we also demonstrate that the case-based approach to preference elicitation isapplicable in domains with uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analytical comparison of the probabilistic distance with some existing distance measures on preferences.",0
"In this article we present two ways of structuring bodies of evidence, which allow us to reduce the complexity of the operations usually performed in the framework of evidence theory. The first structure just partitions the focal elements in a body of evidence by their cardinality. With this structure we are able to reduce the complexity on the calculation of the belief functions Bel, Pl, and Q. The other structure proposed here, the Hierarchical Trees, permits us to reduce the complexity of the calculation of Bel, Pl, and Q, as well as of the Dempster's rule of combination in relation to the brute-force algorithm. Both these structures do not require the generation of all the subsets of the reference domain.",0
"This paper presents a restricted visual Turing test (VTT) for story-line based deep understanding in long-term and multi-camera captured videos. Given a set of videos of a scene (such as a multi-room office, a garden, and a parking lot.) and a sequence of story-line based queries, the task is to provide answers either simply in binary form ""true/false"" (to a polar query) or in an accurate natural language description (to a non-polar query). Queries, polar or non-polar, consist of view-based queries which can be answered from a particular camera view and scene-centered queries which involves joint inference across different cameras. The story lines are collected to cover spatial, temporal and causal understanding of input videos. The data and queries distinguish our VTT from recently proposed visual question answering in images and video captioning. A vision system is proposed to perform joint video and query parsing which integrates different vision modules, a knowledge base and a query engine. The system provides unified interfaces for different modules so that individual modules can be reconfigured to test a new method. We provide a benchmark dataset and a toolkit for ontology guided story-line query generation which consists of about 93.5 hours videos captured in four different locations and 3,426 queries split into 127 story lines. We also provide a baseline implementation and result analyses.",0
"In this paper, for the first time, we study label propagation in heterogeneous graphs under heterophily assumption. Homophily label propagation (i.e., two connected nodes share similar labels) in homogeneous graph (with same types of vertices and relations) has been extensively studied before. Unfortunately, real-life networks are heterogeneous, they contain different types of vertices (e.g., users, images, texts) and relations (e.g., friendships, co-tagging) and allow for each node to propagate both the same and opposite copy of labels to its neighbors. We propose a $\mathcal{K}$-partite label propagation model to handle the mystifying combination of heterogeneous nodes/relations and heterophily propagation. With this model, we develop a novel label inference algorithm framework with update rules in near-linear time complexity. Since real networks change over time, we devise an incremental approach, which supports fast updates for both new data and evidence (e.g., ground truth labels) with guaranteed efficiency. We further provide a utility function to automatically determine whether an incremental or a re-modeling approach is favored. Extensive experiments on real datasets have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, and its superiority over the state-of-the-art label propagation methods.",0
"We start with the history of cognitive radar, where origins of the PAC, Fuster research on cognition and principals of cognition are provided. Fuster describes five cognitive functions: perception, memory, attention, language, and intelligence. We describe the Perception-Action Cyclec as it applies to cognitive radar, and then discuss long-term memory, memory storage, memory retrieval and working memory. A comparison between memory in human cognition and cognitive radar is given as well. Attention is another function described by Fuster, and we have given the comparison of attention in human cognition and cognitive radar. We talk about the four functional blocks from the PAC: Bayesian filter, feedback information, dynamic programming and state-space model for the radar environment. Then, to show that the PAC improves the tracking accuracy of Cognitive Radar over Traditional Active Radar, we have provided simulation results. In the simulation, three nonlinear filters: Cubature Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter are compared. Based on the results, radars implemented with CKF perform better than the radars implemented with UKF or radars implemented with EKF. Further, radar with EKF has the worst accuracy and has the biggest computation load because of derivation and evaluation of Jacobian matrices. We suggest using the concept of risk management to better control parameters and improve performance in cognitive radar. We believe, spectrum sensing can be seen as a potential interest to be used in cognitive radar and we propose a new approach Probabilistic ICA which will presumably reduce noise based on estimation error in cognitive radar. Parallel computing is a concept based on divide and conquers mechanism, and we suggest using the parallel computing approach in cognitive radar by doing complicated calculations or tasks to reduce processing time.",0
"We represent the sequence of fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) brain volumes recorded during a cognitive stimulus by a graph which consists of a set of local meshes. The corresponding cognitive process, encoded in the brain, is then represented by these meshes each of which is estimated assuming a linear relationship among the voxel time series in a predefined locality. First, we define the concept of locality in two neighborhood systems, namely, the spatial and functional neighborhoods. Then, we construct spatially and functionally local meshes around each voxel, called seed voxel, by connecting it either to its spatial or functional p-nearest neighbors. The mesh formed around a voxel is a directed sub-graph with a star topology, where the direction of the edges is taken towards the seed voxel at the center of the mesh. We represent the time series recorded at each seed voxel in terms of linear combination of the time series of its p-nearest neighbors in the mesh. The relationships between a seed voxel and its neighbors are represented by the edge weights of each mesh, and are estimated by solving a linear regression equation. The estimated mesh edge weights lead to a better representation of information in the brain for encoding and decoding of the cognitive tasks. We test our model on a visual object recognition and emotional memory retrieval experiments using Support Vector Machines that are trained using the mesh edge weights as features. In the experimental analysis, we observe that the edge weights of the spatial and functional meshes perform better than the state-of-the-art brain decoding models.",0
"We investigate GPU-based parallelization of Iterative-Deepening A* (IDA*). We show that straightforward thread-based parallelization techniques which were previously proposed for massively parallel SIMD processors perform poorly due to warp divergence and load imbalance. We propose Block-Parallel IDA* (BPIDA*), which assigns the search of a subtree to a block (a group of threads with access to fast shared memory) rather than a thread. On the 15-puzzle, BPIDA* on a NVIDIA GRID K520 with 1536 CUDA cores achieves a speedup of 4.98 compared to a highly optimized sequential IDA* implementation on a Xeon E5-2670 core.",0
"We consider an agent's uncertainty about its environment and the problem of generalizing this uncertainty across observations. Specifically, we focus on the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature, we use sequential density models to measure uncertainty, and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count from an arbitrary sequential density model. This technique enables us to generalize count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas to Atari 2600 games, providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We transform these pseudo-counts into intrinsic rewards and obtain significantly improved exploration in a number of hard games, including the infamously difficult Montezuma's Revenge.",1
"In this article, a survey of several important equilibrium concepts for decentralized networks is presented. The term decentralized is used here to refer to scenarios where decisions (e.g., choosing a power allocation policy) are taken autonomously by devices interacting with each other (e.g., through mutual interference). The iterative long-term interaction is characterized by stable points of the wireless network called equilibria. The interest in these equilibria stems from the relevance of network stability and the fact that they can be achieved by letting radio devices to repeatedly interact over time. To achieve these equilibria, several learning techniques, namely, the best response dynamics, fictitious play, smoothed fictitious play, reinforcement learning algorithms, and regret matching, are discussed in terms of information requirements and convergence properties. Most of the notions introduced here, for both equilibria and learning schemes, are illustrated by a simple case study, namely, an interference channel with two transmitter-receiver pairs.",0
"Collaborative approaches to network defense are being increasingly advocated, aiming to proactively predict and speed up detection of attacks. In particular, a lot of attention has recently been given to the problem of predictive blacklisting, i.e., forecasting attack sources based on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) alerts contributed by different organizations. While collaboration allows the discovery of groups of correlated attacks targeting similar victims, it also raises important privacy and security challenges, thus motivating privacy-preserving approaches to the problem. Although recent work provides encouraging results on the feasibility of collaborative predictive blacklisting via limited data sharing, a number of open problems remain unaddressed, which this paper sets to address. We introduce a privacy-friendly system for predictive blacklisting featuring a semi-trusted authority that clusters organizations based on the similarity of their logs, without access to these logs. Entities in the same cluster then securely share relevant logs with each other, and build predictive blacklists.",0
"This paper describes how the ""SP theory of intelligence"", outlined in an Appendix, may throw light on aspects of commonsense reasoning (CSR) and commonsense knowledge (CSK) (together shortened to CSRK), as discussed in another paper by Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus (DM). The SP system has the generality needed for CSRK: Turing equivalence; the generality of information compression as the foundation for the SP system both in the representation of knowledge and in concepts of prediction and probability; the versatility of the SP system in the representation of knowledge and in aspects of intelligence including forms of reasoning; and the potential of the system for the seamless integration of diverse forms of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Several examples discussed by DM, and how they may be processed in the SP system, are discussed. Also discussed are current successes in CSR (taxonomic reasoning, temporal reasoning, action and change, and qualitative reasoning), how the SP system may promote seamless integration across these areas, and how insights gained from the SP programme of research may yield some potentially useful new ways of approaching these topics. The paper considers how the SP system may help overcome several challenges in the automation of CSR described by DM, and how it meets several of the objectives for research in CSRK that they have described.",0
"In this work, we investigate a novel semantic approach for pattern discovery in trajectories that, relying on ontologies, enhances object movement information with event semantics. The approach can be applied to the detection of movement patterns and behaviors whenever the semantics of events occurring along the trajectory is, explicitly or implicitly, available. In particular, we tested it against an exacting case scenario in maritime surveillance, i.e., the discovery of suspicious container transportations.",0
We discuss the problem of construction of inference procedures which can manipulate with uncertainties measured in ordinal scales and fulfill to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusion. The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear ordering of plausibility values are used. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusions is introduced.,0
"Belief merging is an important but difficult problem in Artificial Intelligence, especially when sources of information are pervaded with uncertainty. Many merging operators have been proposed to deal with this problem in possibilistic logic, a weighted logic which is powerful for handling inconsistency and deal- ing with uncertainty. They often result in a possibilistic knowledge base which is a set of weighted formulas. Although possibilistic logic is inconsistency tolerant, it suers from the well-known ""drowning effect"". Therefore, we may still want to obtain a consistent possi- bilistic knowledge base as the result of merg- ing. In such a case, we argue that it is not always necessary to keep weighted informa- tion after merging. In this paper, we define a merging operator that maps a set of pos- sibilistic knowledge bases and a formula rep- resenting the integrity constraints to a clas- sical knowledge base by using lexicographic ordering. We show that it satisfies nine pos- tulates that generalize basic postulates for propositional merging given in [11]. These postulates capture the principle of minimal change in some sense. We then provide an algorithm for generating the resulting knowl- edge base of our merging operator. Finally, we discuss the compatibility of our merging operator with propositional merging and es- tablish the advantage of our merging opera- tor over existing semantic merging operators in the propositional case.",0
"Since the introduction of the stable marriage problem (SMP) by Gale and Shapley (1962), several variants and extensions have been investigated. While this variety is useful to widen the application potential, each variant requires a new algorithm for finding the stable matchings. To address this issue, we propose an encoding of the SMP using answer set programming (ASP), which can straightforwardly be adapted and extended to suit the needs of specific applications. The use of ASP also means that we can take advantage of highly efficient off-the-shelf solvers. To illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we show how our ASP encoding naturally allows us to select optimal stable matchings, i.e. matchings that are optimal according to some user-specified criterion. To the best of our knowledge, our encoding offers the first exact implementation to find sex-equal, minimum regret, egalitarian or maximum cardinality stable matchings for SMP instances in which individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed.",0
"Over the last few years, the number of smart objects connected to the Internet has grown exponentially in comparison to the number of services and applications. The integration between Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, named as Cloud of Things, plays a key role in managing the connected things, their data and services. One of the main challenges in Cloud of Things is the resource discovery of the smart objects and their reuse in different contexts. Most of the existent work uses some kind of multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm to perform the resource discovery, but do not evaluate the impact that the user constraints has in the final solution. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of the SAW, TOPSIS and VIKOR multi-objective decision analyses algorithms and the impact of user constraints on them. We evaluated the quality of the proposed solutions using the Pareto-optimality concept.",0
"So far different studies have tackled the sentiment analysis in several domains such as restaurant and movie reviews. But, this problem has not been studied in scholarly book reviews which is different in terms of review style and size. In this paper, we propose to combine different features in order to be presented to a supervised classifiers which extract the opinion target expressions and detect their polarities in scholarly book reviews. We construct a labeled corpus for training and evaluating our methods in French book reviews. We also evaluate them on English restaurant reviews in order to measure their robustness across the domains and languages. The evaluation shows that our methods are enough robust for English restaurant reviews and French book reviews.",0
"Several Artificial Intelligence schemes for reasoning under uncertainty explore either explicitly or implicitly asymmetries among probabilities of various states of their uncertain domain models. Even though the correct working of these schemes is practically contingent upon the existence of a small number of probable states, no formal justification has been proposed of why this should be the case. This paper attempts to fill this apparent gap by studying asymmetries among probabilities of various states of uncertain models. By rewriting the joint probability distribution over a model's variables into a product of individual variables' prior and conditional probability distributions, and applying central limit theorem to this product, we can demonstrate that the probabilities of individual states of the model can be expected to be drawn from highly skewed, log-normal distributions. With sufficient asymmetry in individual prior and conditional probability distributions, a small fraction of states can be expected to cover a large portion of the total probability space with the remaining states having practically negligible probability. Theoretical discussion is supplemented by simulation results and an illustrative real-world example.",0
"Recently, considerable focus has been given to the problem of determining the boundary between tractable and intractable planning problems. In this paper, we study the complexity of planning in the class C_n of planning problems, characterized by unary operators and directed path causal graphs. Although this is one of the simplest forms of causal graphs a planning problem can have, we show that planning is intractable for C_n (unless P = NP), even if the domains of state variables have bounded size. In particular, we show that plan existence for C_n^k is NP-hard for k&gt;=5 by reduction from CNFSAT. Here, k denotes the upper bound on the size of the state variable domains. Our result reduces the complexity gap for the class C_n^k to cases k=3 and k=4 only, since C_n^2 is known to be tractable.",0
"The user equilibrium in traffic assignment problem is based on the fact that travelers choose the minimum-cost path between every origin-destination pair and on the assumption that such a behavior will lead to an equilibrium of the traffic network. In this paper, we consider this problem when the traffic network links are fuzzy cost. Therefore, a Physarum-type algorithm is developed to unify the Physarum network and the traffic network for taking full of advantage of Physarum Polycephalum's adaptivity in network design to solve the user equilibrium problem. Eventually, some experiments are used to test the performance of this method. The results demonstrate that our approach is competitive when compared with other existing algorithms.",0
"In this paper, we explore SPPIM-based text classification method, and the experiment reveals that the SPPIM method is equal to or even superior than SGNS method in text classification task on three international and standard text datasets, namely 20newsgroups, Reuters52 and WebKB. Comparing to SGNS, although SPPMI provides a better solution, it is not necessarily better than SGNS in text classification tasks. Based on our analysis, SGNS takes into the consideration of weight calculation during decomposition process, so it has better performance than SPPIM in some standard datasets. Inspired by this, we propose a WL-SPPIM semantic model based on SPPIM model, and experiment shows that WL-SPPIM approach has better classification and higher scalability in the text classification task compared with LDA, SGNS and SPPIM approaches.",0
"It is important to have multi-agent robotic system specifications that ensure correctness properties of safety and liveness. As these systems have concurrency, and often have dynamic environment, the formal specification and verification of these systems along with step-wise refinement from abstract to concrete concepts play a major role in system correctness. Formal verification is used for exhaustive investigation of the system space thus ensuring that undetected failures in the behavior are excluded. We construct the system incrementally from subcomponents, based on software architecture. The challenge is to develop a safe multi-agent robotic system, more specifically to ensure the correctness properties of safety and liveness. Formal specifications based on model-checking are flexible, have a concrete syntax, and play vital role in correctness of a multi-agent robotic system. To formally verify safety and liveness of such systems is important because they have high concurrency and in most of the cases have dynamic environment. We have considered a case-study of a multi-agent robotic system for the transport of stock between storehouses to exemplify our formal approach. Our proposed development approach allows for formal verification during specification definition. The development process has been classified in to four major phases of requirement specifications, verification specifications, architecture specifications and implementation.",0
"Space situational awareness (SSA) is vital for international safety and security, and the future of space travel. By improving SSA data-sharing we improve global SSA. Computational ontology should provide one means toward that goal. This paper develops the ontology of the SSA domain and takes steps in the creation of a Space Situational Awareness Ontology. It follows (Rovetto, 2015) and outlines objectives, requirements and desiderata; and describes the SSA domain and discipline of ontology. The purposes of the SSA ontology are to explore the potential for ontology development and engineering to (i) represent SSA data, general knowledge, and domain objects, (ii) clearly annotate and express the meaning of that orbital, near-earth and deep-space da-ta, and (iii) foster SSA data sharing among SSA actors and space object catalogs. By improving global SSA via actionable data- and knowledge-exchange, we can achieve the broader goals (and motivations) of (iv) advancing our capacity for planetary defense from near- or deep-space ob-ects, and (v) improving spaceflight safety for future generations.",0
"Traditional Artificial Cognitive Systems (for example, intelligent robots) share a number of limitations. First, they are usually made up only of machine components; humans are only playing the role of user or supervisor. And yet, there are tasks in which the current state of the art of AI has much worse performance or is more expensive than humans: thus, it would be highly beneficial to have a systematic way of creating systems with both human and machine components, possibly with remote non-expert humans providing short-duration real-time services. Second, their components are often dedicated to only one system, and underutilized for a big part of their lifetime. Third, there is no inherent support for robust operation, and if a new better component becomes available, one cannot easily replace the old component. Fourth, they are viewed as a resource to be developed and owned, not as a utility. Thus, we are presenting CLIC: a framework for constructing cognitive systems that overcome the above limitations. The architecture of CLIC provides specific mechanisms for creating and operating cognitive systems that fulfill a set of desiderata: First, that are distributed yet situated, interacting with the physical world though sensing and actuation services, and that are also combining human as well as machine services. Second, that are made up of components that are time-shared and re-usable. Third, that provide increased robustness through self-repair. Fourth, that are constructed and reconstructed on the fly, with components that dynamically enter and exit the system during operation, on the basis of availability, pricing, and need. Importantly, fifth, the cognitive systems created and operated by CLIC do not need to be owned and can be provided on demand, as a utility; thus transforming human-machine situated intelligence to a service, and opening up many interesting opportunities.",0
"Possibilistic logic, an extension of first-order logic, deals with uncertainty that can be estimated in terms of possibility and necessity measures. Syntactically, this means that a first-order formula is equipped with a possibility degree or a necessity degree that expresses to what extent the formula is possibly or necessarily true. Possibilistic resolution yields a calculus for possibilistic logic which respects the semantics developed for possibilistic logic. A drawback, which possibilistic resolution inherits from classical resolution, is that it may not terminate if applied to formulas belonging to decidable fragments of first-order logic. Therefore we propose an alternative proof method for possibilistic logic. The main feature of this method is that it completely abstracts from a concrete calculus but uses as basic operation a test for classical entailment. We then instantiate possibilistic logic with a terminological logic, which is a decidable subclass o f first-order logic but nevertheless much more expressive than propositional logic. This yields an extension of terminological logics towards the representation of uncertain knowledge which is satisfactory from a semantic as well as algorithmic point of view.",0
"The bbob-biobj test suite contains 55 bi-objective functions in continuous domain which are derived from combining functions of the well-known single-objective noiseless bbob test suite. Besides giving the actual function definitions and presenting their (known) properties, this documentation also aims at giving the rationale behind our approach in terms of function groups, instances, and potential objective space normalization.",0
"Many different approaches for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) and related Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs) exist. However, there is no single solver (nor approach) that performs well on all classes of problems and many portfolio approaches for selecting a suitable solver based on simple syntactic features of the input CSP instance have been developed. In this paper we first present a simple portfolio method for CSP based on k-nearest neighbors method. Then, we propose a new way of using portfolio systems --- training them shortly in the exploitation time, specifically for the set of instances to be solved and using them on that set. Thorough evaluation has been performed and has shown that the approach yields good results. We evaluated several machine learning techniques for our portfolio. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, the selected k-nearest neighbors method is especially suited for our short training approach and it also yields the best results among the tested methods. We also confirm that our approach yields good results on SAT domain.",0
"In this paper the author presents a kind of Soft Computing Technique, mainly an application of fuzzy set theory of Prof. Zadeh [16], on a problem of Medical Experts Systems. The choosen problem is on design of a physician's decision model which can take crisp as well as fuzzy data as input, unlike the traditional models. The author presents a mathematical model based on fuzzy set theory for physician aided evaluation of a complete representation of information emanating from the initial interview including patient past history, present symptoms, and signs observed upon physical examination and results of clinical and diagnostic tests.",0
"Participants in recent discussions of AI-related issues ranging from intelligence explosion to technological unemployment have made diverse claims about the nature, pace, and drivers of progress in AI. However, these theories are rarely specified in enough detail to enable systematic evaluation of their assumptions or to extrapolate progress quantitatively, as is often done with some success in other technological domains. After reviewing relevant literatures and justifying the need for more rigorous modeling of AI progress, this paper contributes to that research program by suggesting ways to account for the relationship between hardware speed increases and algorithmic improvements in AI, the role of human inputs in enabling AI capabilities, and the relationships between different sub-fields of AI. It then outlines ways of tailoring AI progress models to generate insights on the specific issue of technological unemployment, and outlines future directions for research on AI progress.",0
"Unlike perfect-information games, imperfect-information games cannot be solved by decomposing the game into subgames that are solved independently. Instead, all decisions must consider the strategy of the game as a whole, and more computationally intensive algorithms are used. While it is not possible to solve an imperfect-information game exactly through decomposition, it is possible to approximate solutions, or improve existing strategies, by solving disjoint subgames. This process is referred to as subgame solving. We introduce subgame solving techniques that outperform prior methods both in theory and practice. We also show how to adapt them, and past subgame solving techniques, to respond to opponent actions that are outside the original action abstraction; this significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approach, action translation. Finally, we show that subgame solving can be repeated as the game progresses down the tree, leading to lower exploitability. Subgame solving is a key component of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top humans in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.",1
"Maintenance of association rules is an interesting problem. Several incremental maintenance algorithms were proposed since the work of (Cheung et al, 1996). The majority of these algorithms maintain rule bases assuming that support threshold doesn't change. In this paper, we present incremental maintenance algorithm under support threshold change. This solution allows user to maintain its rule base under any support threshold.",0
"In this paper we explore the application of some notable Boolean methods, namely the Disjunctive Normal Form representation of logic table expansions, and apply them to a real-valued logic model which utilizes quantities on the range [0,1] to produce a probabilistic programming of a game character's logic in mathematical form.",0
"We develop a two-defender (Alice and Bob) invasion game using the method of projective simulation. The agent, say Alice, encounters attack' symbols coming from the right attacker where she can learn to prevent. However, some of these signs are invisible for her. Instead, she perceives some other signs that are related to Bob's task. We elaborate an example in which an agent perceives an equal portion of percepts from both attackers. Alice can choose to concentrate on her job, though she loses some attacks. Alternatively, she can have some collaboration with Bob to get and give help. It is concluded that the maximum blocking efficiency in concentration is just the minimum blocking efficiency in collaboration. Furthermore, Alice has a choice to select two different forgetting factors for her task or helping. Therefore, she can choose between herself and the other. As the main result, we conclude that if Alice selects to be selfish, she probably earns more blocking in her task and also, higher efficiency in collective blocking, regardless of Bob's selection. In addition, it turns out that when the selection of both partners is selfishness, it is the highest justice on sharing individual efficiency and it is a maximum in collective blocking efficiency too. Finally, we propose some other questions that can be tracked regarding the present study.",0
"It was recently shown that the problem of decoding messages transmitted through a noisy channel can be formulated as a belief updating task over a probabilistic network [McEliece]. Moreover, it was observed that iterative application of the (linear time) Pearl's belief propagation algorithm designed for polytrees outperformed state of the art decoding algorithms, even though the corresponding networks may have many cycles. This paper demonstrates empirically that an approximation algorithm approx-mpe for solving the most probable explanation (MPE) problem, developed within the recently proposed mini-bucket elimination framework [Dechter96], outperforms iterative belief propagation on classes of coding networks that have bounded induced width. Our experiments suggest that approximate MPE decoders can be good competitors to the approximate belief updating decoders.",0
"Knowledge bases (KBs) have attracted increasing attention due to its great success in various areas, such as Web and mobile search.Existing KBs are restricted to objective factual knowledge, such as city population or fruit shape, whereas,subjective knowledge, such as big city, which is commonly mentioned in Web and mobile queries, has been neglected. Subjective knowledge differs from objective knowledge in that it has no documented or observed ground truth. Instead, the truth relies on people's dominant opinion. Thus, we can use the crowdsourcing technique to get opinion from the crowd. In our work, we propose a system, called crowdsourced subjective knowledge acquisition (CoSKA),for subjective knowledge acquisition powered by crowdsourcing and existing KBs. The acquired knowledge can be used to enrich existing KBs in the subjective dimension which bridges the gap between existing objective knowledge and subjective queries.The main challenge of CoSKA is the conflict between large scale knowledge facts and limited crowdsourcing resource. To address this challenge, in this work, we define knowledge inference rules and then select the seed knowledge judiciously for crowdsourcing to maximize the inference power under the resource constraint. Our experimental results on real knowledge base and crowdsourcing platform verify the effectiveness of CoSKA system.",0
"This work presents and analyzes three convolutional neural network (CNN) models for efficient pixelwise classification of images. When using convolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole image, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding window networks. This set of new architectures solve this issue by either removing redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that inherently predict many pixels at once.",0
"Automatic video keyword generation is one of the key ingredients in reducing the burden of security officers in analyzing surveillance videos. Keywords or attributes are generally chosen manually based on expert knowledge of surveillance. Most existing works primarily aim at either supervised learning approaches relying on extensive manual labelling or hierarchical probabilistic models that assume the features are extracted using the bag-of-words approach; thus limiting the utilization of the other features. To address this, we turn our attention to automatic attribute discovery approaches. However, it is not clear which automatic discovery approach can discover the most meaningful attributes. Furthermore, little research has been done on how to compare and choose the best automatic attribute discovery methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the shared structure exhibited amongst meaningful attributes, that enables us to compare between different automatic attribute discovery approaches.We then validate our approach by comparing various attribute discovery methods such as PiCoDeS on two attribute datasets. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to select the automatic discovery approach that discovers the most meaningful attributes. We then employ the best discovery approach to generate keywords for videos recorded from a surveillance system. This work shows it is possible to massively reduce the amount of manual work in generating video keywords without limiting ourselves to a particular video feature descriptor.",0
"Inspired by the hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMM), we present the hierarchical semi-Markov conditional random field (HSCRF), a generalisation of embedded undirectedMarkov chains tomodel complex hierarchical, nestedMarkov processes. It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we consider partiallysupervised learning and propose algorithms for generalised partially-supervised learning and constrained inference. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases.",1
"Biometrics systems have been used in a wide range of applications and have improved people authentication. Signature verification is one of the most common biometric methods with techniques that employ various specifications of a signature.

In this paper, deep learning method has been used for feature extraction and feature selection.",0
"We consider the following problem in which a given number of items has to be chosen from a predefined set. Each item is described by a vector of attributes and for each attribute there is a desired distribution that the selected set should have. We look for a set that fits as much as possible the desired distributions on all attributes. Examples of applications include choosing members of a representative committee, where candidates are described by attributes such as sex, age and profession, and where we look for a committee that for each attribute offers a certain representation, i.e., a single committee that contains a certain number of young and old people, certain number of men and women, certain number of people with different professions, etc. With a single attribute the problem collapses to the apportionment problem for party-list proportional representation systems (in such case the value of the single attribute would be a political affiliation of a candidate). We study the properties of the associated subset selection rules, as well as their computation complexity.",1
"Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is a challenging issue of urban development in developing countries. Each country having different socio-economic-environmental background, might not accept a particular disposal method as the optimal choice. Selection of suitable disposal method in MSWM, under vague and imprecise information can be considered as multi criteria decision making problem (MCDM). In the present paper, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodology is extended based on credibility theory for evaluating the performances of MSW disposal methods under some criteria fixed by experts. The proposed model helps decision makers to choose a preferable alternative for their municipal area. A sensitivity analysis by our proposed model confirms this fact.",0
"This paper concerns the probabilistic evaluation of the effects of actions in the presence of unmeasured variables. We show that the identification of causal effect between a singleton variable X and a set of variables Y can be accomplished systematically, in time polynomial in the number of variables in the graph. When the causal effect is identifiable, a closed-form expression can be obtained for the probability that the action will achieve a specified goal, or a set of goals.",0
"We present weight normalization: a reparameterization of the weight vectors in a neural network that decouples the length of those weight vectors from their direction. By reparameterizing the weights in this way we improve the conditioning of the optimization problem and we speed up convergence of stochastic gradient descent. Our reparameterization is inspired by batch normalization but does not introduce any dependencies between the examples in a minibatch. This means that our method can also be applied successfully to recurrent models such as LSTMs and to noise-sensitive applications such as deep reinforcement learning or generative models, for which batch normalization is less well suited. Although our method is much simpler, it still provides much of the speed-up of full batch normalization. In addition, the computational overhead of our method is lower, permitting more optimization steps to be taken in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on applications in supervised image recognition, generative modelling, and deep reinforcement learning.",1
"We study machine learning formulations of inductive program synthesis; that is, given input-output examples, synthesize source code that maps inputs to corresponding outputs. Our key contribution is TerpreT, a domain-specific language for expressing program synthesis problems. A TerpreT model is composed of a specification of a program representation and an interpreter that describes how programs map inputs to outputs. The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. From a TerpreT model we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends: gradient descent (thus each TerpreT model can be seen as defining a differentiable interpreter), linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing proper comparisons between different approaches to inference.",0
"People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where two agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ""analogy making"", or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.",1
"This paper presents a new approach for classification of dysfluent and fluent speech using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). The speech is fluent when person's speech flows easily and smoothly. Sounds combine into syllable, syllables mix together into words and words link into sentences with little effort. When someone's speech is dysfluent, it is irregular and does not flow effortlessly. Therefore, a dysfluency is a break in the smooth, meaningful flow of speech. Stuttering is one such disorder in which the fluent flow of speech is disrupted by occurrences of dysfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations, interjections and so on. In this work we have considered three types of dysfluencies such as repetition, prolongation and interjection to characterize dysfluent speech. After obtaining dysfluent and fluent speech, the speech signals are analyzed in order to extract MFCC features. The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify the speech as dysfluent and fluent speech. The 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. The average accuracy of 86.67% and 93.34% is obtained for dysfluent and fluent speech respectively.",0
"Accurate and computationally efficient means for classifying human activities have been the subject of extensive research efforts. Most current research focuses on extracting complex features to achieve high classification accuracy.

"ASHACL, a variant of the W3C Shapes Constraint Language, is designed to determine whether an RDF graph meets some conditions. These conditions are grouped into shapes, which validate whether particular RDF terms each meet the constraints of the shape. Shapes are themselves expressed as RDF triples in an RDF graph, called a shapes graph.",0
"In the last few decades, numerous experiments have shown that humans do not always behave so as to maximize their material payoff. Cooperative behavior when non-cooperation is a dominant strategy (with respect to the material payoffs) is particularly puzzling. Here we propose a novel approach to explain cooperation, assuming what Halpern and Pass call translucent players. Typically, players are assumed to be opaque, in the sense that a deviation by one player in a normal-form game does not affect the strategies used by other players. But a player may believe that if he switches from one strategy to another, the fact that he chooses to switch may be visible to the other players. For example, if he chooses to defect in Prisoner's Dilemma, the other player may sense his guilt. We show that by assuming translucent players, we can recover many of the regularities observed in human behavior in well-studied games such as Prisoner's Dilemma, Traveler's Dilemma, Bertrand Competition, and the Public Goods game.",0
"This paper describes a novel approach to software engineering derived from the ""SP theory of intelligence"" and its realisation in the ""SP computer model"". These are the bases of a projected industrial-strength ""SP machine"" which, when mature, is anticipated to be the vehicle for software engineering as described in this paper. Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation of semi-automation of software development, with non-automatic programming of the SP system where necessary; allowing programmers to concentrate on 'real-world' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing; the ambitious long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language; reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation'; reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation; reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software; reducing the need for an explicit process of validation of software; no formal distinction between program and database; potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages; benefits for version control; and reducing technical debt.",0
"This paper contributes a first study into how different human users deliver simultaneous control and feedback signals during human-robot interaction. As part of this work, we formalize and present a general interactive learning framework for online cooperation between humans and reinforcement learning agents. In many human-machine interaction settings, there is a growing gap between the degrees-of-freedom of complex semi-autonomous systems and the number of human control channels. Simple human control and feedback mechanisms are required to close this gap and allow for better collaboration between humans and machines on complex tasks. To better inform the design of concurrent control and feedback interfaces, we present experimental results from a human-robot collaborative domain wherein the human must simultaneously deliver both control and feedback signals to interactively train an actor-critic reinforcement learning robot. We compare three experimental conditions: 1) human delivered control signals, 2) reward-shaping feedback signals, and 3) simultaneous control and feedback. Our results suggest that subjects provide less feedback when simultaneously delivering feedback and control signals and that control signal quality is not significantly diminished. Our data suggest that subjects may also modify when and how they provide feedback. Through algorithmic development and tuning informed by this study, we expect semi-autonomous actions of robotic agents can be better shaped by human feedback, allowing for seamless collaboration and improved performance in difficult interactive domains.",0
"We study the complexity of reasoning in abstracts argumentation frameworks close to graph classes that allow for efficient reasoning methods, i.e.\ to one of the classes of acyclic, noeven, biparite and symmetric AFs.

"In the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, various heterogeneous ubiquitous devices would be able to connect and communicate with each other seamlessly, irrespective of the domain. Semantic representation of data through detailed standardized annotation has shown to improve the integration of the interconnected heterogeneous devices. However, the semantic representation of these heterogeneous data sources for environmental monitoring systems is not yet well supported. To achieve the maximum benefits of IoT for drought forecasting, a dedicated semantic middleware solution is required. This research proposes a middleware that semantically represents and integrates heterogeneous data sources with indigenous knowledge based on a unified ontology for an accurate IoT-based drought early warning system (DEWS).",0
"We investigate a class of first-order temporal-epistemic logics for reasoning about multi-agent systems. We encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall, synchronicity, no learning, and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems, a first-order extension of interpreted systems. We identify several monodic fragments of first-order temporal-epistemic logic and show their completeness with respect to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems.",0
"There has been a great deal of recent interest in methods for performing lifted inference; however, most of this work assumes that the first-order model is given as input to the system. Here, we describe lifted inference algorithms that determine symmetries and automatically lift the probabilistic model to speedup inference. In particular, we describe approximate lifted inference techniques that allow the user to trade off inference accuracy for computational efficiency by using a handful of tunable parameters, while keeping the error bounded. Our algorithms are closely related to the graph-theoretic concept of bisimulation. We report experiments on both synthetic and real data to show that in the presence of symmetries, run-times for inference can be improved significantly, with approximate lifted inference providing orders of magnitude speedup over ground inference.",0
"Background: Lung cancer was known as primary cancers and the survival rate of cancer is about 15%. Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate. All symptoms (features) of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas. It needs an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate. For accurate detection, it need characterizes efficient features and delete redundancy features among all features. Feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features. Materials and Methods: Lung cancer database consist of 32 patient records with 57 features. This database collected by Hong and Youngand indexed in the University of California Irvine repository. Experimental contents include the extracted from the clinical data and X-ray data, etc. The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers and all features are taking an integer value 0-3. In our study, new method is proposed for identify efficient features of lung cancer. It is based on Hyper-Heuristic. Results: We obtained an accuracy of 80.63% using reduced 11 feature set. The proposed method compare to the accuracy of 5 machine learning feature selections. The accuracy of these 5 methods are 60.94, 57.81, 68.75, 60.94 and 68.75. Conclusions: The proposed method has better performance with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed model is recommended for identifying an efficient symptom of Disease. These finding are very important in health research, particularly in allocation of medical resources for patients who predicted as high-risks",0
"Basically, in (one-player) war Real Time Strategy (wRTS) games a human player controls, in real time, an army consisting of a number of soldiers and her aim is to destroy the opponent's assets where the opponent is a virtual (i.e., non-human player controlled) player that usually consists of a pre-programmed decision-making script. These scripts have usually associated some well-known problems (e.g., predictability, non-rationality, repetitive behaviors, and sensation of artificial stupidity among others). This paper describes a method for the automatic generation of virtual players that adapt to the player skills; this is done by building initially a model of the player behavior in real time during the game, and further evolving the virtual player via this model in-between two games. The paper also shows preliminary results obtained on a one player wRTS game constructed specifically for experimentation.",0

The work has useful application in the development of a complete OCR system for handwritten Bangla text.",0
"Efficiently finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration of a graphical model is an important problem which is often implemented using message passing algorithms. The optimality of such algorithms is only well established for singly-connected graphs and other limited settings. This article extends the set of graphs where MAP estimation is in P and where message passing recovers the exact solution to so-called perfect graphs. This result leverages recent progress in defining perfect graphs (the strong perfect graph theorem), linear programming relaxations of MAP estimation and recent convergent message passing schemes. The article converts graphical models into nand Markov random fields which are straightforward to relax into linear programs. Therein, integrality can be established in general by testing for graph perfection. This perfection test is performed efficiently using a polynomial time algorithm. Alternatively, known decomposition tools from perfect graph theory may be used to prove perfection for certain families of graphs. Thus, a general graph framework is provided for determining when MAP estimation in any graphical model is in P, has an integral linear programming relaxation and is exactly recoverable by message passing.",0
"The main goal of this paper is to describe a new pruning method for solving decision trees and game trees. The pruning method for decision trees suggests a slight variant of decision trees that we call scenario trees. In scenario trees, we do not need a conditional probability for each edge emanating from a chance node. Instead, we require a joint probability for each path from the root node to a leaf node. We compare the pruning method to the traditional rollback method for decision trees and game trees. For problems that require Bayesian revision of probabilities, a scenario tree representation with the pruning method is more efficient than a decision tree representation with the rollback method. For game trees, the pruning method is more efficient than the rollback method.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of handling spatial misalignments due to camera-view changes or human-pose variations in person re-identification. We first introduce a boosting-based approach to learn a correspondence structure which indicates the patch-wise matching probabilities between images from a target camera pair. The learned correspondence structure can not only capture the spatial correspondence pattern between cameras but also handle the viewpoint or human-pose variation in individual images. We further introduce a global constraint-based matching process. It integrates a global matching constraint over the learned correspondence structure to exclude cross-view misalignments during the image patch matching process, hence achieving a more reliable matching score between images. Finally, we also extend our approach by introducing a multi-structure scheme, which learns a set of local correspondence structures to capture the spatial correspondence sub-patterns between a camera pair, so as to handle the spatial misalignments between individual images in a more precise way. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"Relational learning deals with data that are characterized by relational structures. An important task is collective classification, which is to jointly classify networked objects. While it holds a great promise to produce a better accuracy than non-collective classifiers, collective classification is computational challenging and has not leveraged on the recent breakthroughs of deep learning. We present Column Network (CLN), a novel deep learning model for collective classification in multi-relational domains. CLN has many desirable theoretical properties: (i) it encodes multi-relations between any two instances; (ii) it is deep and compact, allowing complex functions to be approximated at the network level with a small set of free parameters; (iii) local and relational features are learned simultaneously; (iv) long-range, higher-order dependencies between instances are supported naturally; and (v) crucially, learning and inference are efficient, linear in the size of the network and the number of relations. We evaluate CLN on multiple real-world applications: (a) delay prediction in software projects, (b) PubMed Diabetes publication classification and (c) film genre classification. In all applications, CLN demonstrates a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art rivals.",1
"The study of phase transition phenomenon of NP complete problems plays an important role in understanding the nature of hard problems. In this paper, we follow this line of research by considering the problem of counting solutions of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (#CSP). We consider the random model, i.e. RB model. We prove that phase transition of #CSP does exist as the number of variables approaches infinity and the critical values where phase transitions occur are precisely located. Preliminary experimental results also show that the critical point coincides with the theoretical derivation. Moreover, we propose an approximate algorithm to estimate the expectation value of the solutions number of a given CSP instance of RB model.",0

"Deep residual learning (ResNet) is a new method for training very deep neural networks using identity map-ping for shortcut connections. ResNet has won the ImageNet ILSVRC 2015 classification task, and achieved state-of-the-art performances in many computer vision tasks. However, the effect of residual learning on noisy natural language processing tasks is still not well understood. In this paper, we design a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning, and investigate its impacts on the task of distantly supervised noisy relation extraction. In contradictory to popular beliefs that ResNet only works well for very deep networks, we found that even with 9 layers of CNNs, using identity mapping could significantly improve the performance for distantly-supervised relation extraction.",1
"The paper describes some basic approaches to detection of bottlenecks in composite (modular) systems. The following basic system bottlenecks detection problems are examined: (1) traditional quality management approaches (Pareto chart based method, multicriteria analysis as selection of Pareto-efficient points, and/or multicriteria ranking), (2) selection of critical system elements (critical components/modules, critical component interconnection), (3) selection of interconnected system components as composite system faults (via clique-based fusion), (4) critical elements (e.g., nodes) in networks, and (5) predictive detection of system bottlenecks (detection of system components based on forecasting of their parameters). Here, heuristic solving schemes are used. Numerical examples illustrate the approaches.",0

"Feature reduction is an important concept which is used for reducing dimensions to decrease the computation complexity and time of classification. Since now many approaches have been proposed for solving this problem, but almost all of them just presented a fix output for each input dataset that some of them aren't satisfied cases for classification. In this we proposed an approach as processing input dataset to increase accuracy rate of each feature extraction methods. First of all, a new concept called dispelling classes gradually (DCG) is proposed to increase separability of classes based on their labels. Next, this method is used to process input dataset of the feature reduction approaches to decrease the misclassification error rate of their outputs more than when output is achieved without any processing. In addition our method has a good quality to collate with noise based on adapting dataset with feature reduction approaches. In the result part, two conditions (With process and without that) are compared to support our idea by using some of UCI datasets.",0
"This paper describes a method for identification of the informative variables in the information system with discrete decision variables. It is targeted specifically towards discovery of the variables that are non-informative when considered alone, but are informative when the synergistic interactions between multiple variables are considered. To this end, the mutual entropy of all possible k-tuples of variables with decision variable is computed. Then, for each variable the maximal information gain due to interactions with other variables is obtained. For non-informative variables this quantity conforms to the well known statistical distributions. This allows for discerning truly informative variables from non-informative ones. For demonstration of the approach, the method is applied to several synthetic datasets that involve complex multidimensional interactions between variables. It is capable of identifying most important informative variables, even in the case when the dimensionality of the analysis is smaller than the true dimensionality of the problem. What is more, the high sensitivity of the algorithm allows for detection of the influence of nuisance variables on the response variable.",0
"Anytime inference is inference performed incrementally, with the accuracy of the inference being controlled by a tunable parameter, usually time. Such anytime inference algorithms are also usually interruptible, gradually converging to the exact inference value until terminated. While anytime inference algorithms for specific domains like probability potentials exist in the literature, our objective in this article is to obtain an anytime inference algorithm which is sufficiently generic to cover a wide range of domains. For this we utilise the theory of generic inference as a basis for constructing an anytime inference algorithm, and in particular, extending work done on ordered valuation algebras. The novel contribution of this work is the construction of anytime algorithms in a generic framework, which automatically gives us instantiations in various useful domains. We also show how to apply this generic framework for anytime inference in semiring induced valuation algebras, an important subclass of valuation algebras, which includes instances like probability potentials, disjunctive normal forms and distributive lattices.",0
"Web Service is one of the most significant current discussions in information sharing technologies and one of the examples of service oriented processing. To ensure accurate execution of web services operations, it must be adaptable with policies of the social networks in which it signs up. This adaptation implements using controls called 'Commitment'. This paper describes commitments structure and existing research about commitments and social web services, then suggests an algorithm for consistency of commitments in social web services. As regards the commitments may be executed concurrently, a key challenge in web services execution based on commitment structure is consistency ensuring in execution time. The purpose of this research is providing an algorithm for consistency ensuring between web services operations based on commitments structure.",0
"The predominant knowledge-based approach to automated model construction, compositional modelling, employs a set of models of particular functional components. Its inference mechanism takes a scenario describing the constituent interacting components of a system and translates it into a useful mathematical model. This paper presents a novel compositional modelling approach aimed at building model repositories. It furthers the field in two respects. Firstly, it expands the application domain of compositional modelling to systems that can not be easily described in terms of interacting functional components, such as ecological systems. Secondly, it enables the incorporation of user preferences into the model selection process. These features are achieved by casting the compositional modelling problem as an activity-based dynamic preference constraint satisfaction problem, where the dynamic constraints describe the restrictions imposed over the composition of partial models and the preferences correspond to those of the user of the automated modeller. In addition, the preference levels are represented through the use of symbolic values that differ in orders of magnitude.",0
"We take a general approach to uncertainty on product spaces, and give sufficient conditions for the independence structures of uncertainty measures to satisfy graphoid properties. Since these conditions are arguably more intuitive than some of the graphoid properties, they can be viewed as explanations why probability and certain other formalisms generate graphoids. The conditions include a sufficient condition for the Intersection property which can still apply even if there is a strong logical relations hip between the variables. We indicate how these results can be used to produce theories of qualitative conditional probability which are semi-graphoids and graphoids.",0

"Finding the physical location of a specific network node is a prototypical task for navigation inside a wireless network. In this paper, we consider in depth the implications of wireless communication as a measurement input of gradient-based taxis algorithms. We discuss how gradients can be measured and determine the errors of this estimation. We then introduce a gradient-based taxis algorithm as an example of a family of gradient-based, convergent algorithms and discuss its convergence in the context of network robotics. We also conduct an exemplary experiment to show how to overcome some of the specific problems related to network robotics. Finally, we show how to adapt this framework to more complex objectives.",0
"Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov decision process planning, there exist important problems that have highly structured models. Previous researchers have used this insight to construct more efficient algorithms for factored domains, and for domains with topological structure in the flat state dynamics model. In our work, motivated by findings from the education community relevant to automated tutoring, we consider problems that exhibit a form of topological structure in the factored dynamics model. Our Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains (RAPID) leverages this structure to efficiently compute a good initial envelope of reachable states under the optimal MDP policy in time linear in the number of state variables. RAPID performs partially-observable planning over the limited envelope of states, and slowly expands the state space considered as time allows. RAPID performs well on a large tutoring-inspired problem simulation with 122 state variables, corresponding to a flat state space of over 10^30 states.",0
"This paper presents several novel generalization bounds for the problem of learning kernels based on the analysis of the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding hypothesis sets. Our bound for learning kernels with a convex combination of p base kernels has only a log(p) dependency on the number of kernels, p, which is considerably more favorable than the previous best bound given for the same problem. We also give a novel bound for learning with a linear combination of p base kernels with an L_2 regularization whose dependency on p is only in p^{1/4}.",1
Expert systems prove to be suitable replacement for human experts when human experts are unavailable for different reasons. Various expert system has been developed for wide range of application. Although some expert systems in the field of fishery and aquaculture has been developed but a system that aids user in process of selecting a new addition to their aquarium tank never been designed. This paper proposed an expert system that suggests new addition to an aquarium tank based on current environmental condition of aquarium and currently existing fishes in aquarium. The system suggest the best fit for aquarium condition and most compatible to other fishes in aquarium.,0
"In this work, we introduce graphical modelsfor multi-player game theory, and give powerful algorithms for computing their Nash equilibria in certain cases. An n-player game is given by an undirected graph on n nodes and a set of n local matrices. The interpretation is that the payoff to player i is determined entirely by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and thus the payoff matrix to player i is indexed only by these players. We thus view the global n-player game as being composed of interacting local games, each involving many fewer players. Each player's action may have global impact, but it occurs through the propagation of local influences.Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibria when the underlying graph is a tree (or can be turned into a tree with few node mergings). The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the representation (the graph and theassociated local game matrices), and comes in two related but distinct flavors. The first version involves an approximation step, and computes a representation of all approximate Nash equilibria (of which there may be an exponential number in general). The second version allows the exact computation of Nash equilibria at the expense of weakened complexity bounds. The algorithm requires only local message-passing between nodes (and thus can be implemented by the players themselves in a distributed manner). Despite an analogy to inference in Bayes nets that we develop, the analysis of our algorithm is more involved than that for the polytree algorithm in, owing partially to the fact that we must either compute, or select from, an exponential number of potential solutions. We discuss a number of extensions, such as the computation of equilibria with desirable global properties (e.g. maximizing global return), and directions for further research.",0

We describe these ideas, the initial set of corpora, and some initial experiments done over them.",0
"This survey explores Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML), defined as the generation of game content using machine learning models trained on existing content. As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, co-creativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the resulting generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models, $n$-grams, and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in the application of PCGML, including learning from small datasets, lack of training data, multi-layered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.",0
"Previous work has shown that the problem of learning the optimal structure of a Bayesian network can be formulated as a shortest path finding problem in a graph and solved using A* search. In this paper, we improve the scalability of this approach by developing a memory-efficient heuristic search algorithm for learning the structure of a Bayesian network. Instead of using A*, we propose a frontier breadth-first branch and bound search that leverages the layered structure of the search graph of this problem so that no more than two layers of the graph, plus solution reconstruction information, need to be stored in memory at a time. To further improve scalability, the algorithm stores most of the graph in external memory, such as hard disk, when it does not fit in RAM. Experimental results show that the resulting algorithm solves significantly larger problems than the current state of the art.",0

"In cooperative multi-agent sequential decision making under uncertainty, agents must coordinate to find an optimal joint policy that maximises joint value. Typical algorithms exploit additive structure in the value function, but in the fully-observable multi-agent MDP setting (MMDP) such structure is not present. We propose a new optimal solver for transition-independent MMDPs, in which agents can only affect their own state but their reward depends on joint transitions. We represent these dependencies compactly in conditional return graphs (CRGs). Using CRGs the value of a joint policy and the bounds on partially specified joint policies can be efficiently computed. We propose CoRe, a novel branch-and-bound policy search algorithm building on CRGs. CoRe typically requires less runtime than the available alternatives and finds solutions to problems previously unsolvable.",0
"The focus of this work is to enumerate the various approaches and algorithms that center around application of reinforcement learning in robotic ma- ]]nipulation tasks. Earlier methods utilized specialized policy representations and human demonstrations to constrict the policy. Such methods worked well with continuous state and policy space of robots but failed to come up with generalized policies. Subsequently, high dimensional non-linear function approximators like neural networks have been used to learn policies from scratch. Several novel and recent approaches have also embedded control policy with efficient perceptual representation using deep learning. This has led to the emergence of a new branch of dynamic robot control system called deep r inforcement learning(DRL). This work embodies a survey of the most recent algorithms, architectures and their implementations in simulations and real world robotic platforms. The gamut of DRL architectures are partitioned into two different branches namely, discrete action space algorithms(DAS) and continuous action space algorithms(CAS). Further, the CAS algorithms are divided into stochastic continuous action space(SCAS) and deterministic continuous action space(DCAS) algorithms. Along with elucidating an organ- isation of the DRL algorithms this work also manifests some of the state of the art applications of these approaches in robotic manipulation tasks.",0
"Making sense of incomplete and conflicting narrative knowledge in the presence of abnormalities, unobservable processes, and other real world considerations is a challenge and crucial requirement for cognitive robotics systems.

"With the popularity of massive open online courses, grading through crowdsourcing has become a prevalent approach towards large scale classes. However, for getting grades for complex tasks, which require specific skills and efforts for grading, crowdsourcing encounters a restriction of insufficient knowledge of the workers from the crowd. Due to knowledge limitation of the crowd graders, grading based on partial perspectives becomes a big challenge for evaluating complex tasks through crowdsourcing. Especially for those tasks which not only need specific knowledge for grading, but also should be graded as a whole instead of being decomposed into smaller and simpler subtasks. We propose a framework for grading complex tasks via multiple views, which are different grading perspectives defined by experts for the task, to provide uniformity. Aggregation algorithm based on graders variances are used to combine the grades for each view. We also detect bias patterns of the graders, and debias them regarding each view of the task. Bias pattern determines how the behavior is biased among graders, which is detected by a statistical technique. The proposed approach is analyzed on a synthetic data set. We show that our model gives more accurate results compared to the grading approaches without different views and debiasing algorithm.",0
"Information sources such as relational databases, spreadsheets, XML, JSON, and Web APIs contain a tremendous amount of structured data that can be leveraged to build and augment knowledge graphs. However, they rarely provide a semantic model to describe their contents. Semantic models of data sources represent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the relationships within the data. Such models are the key ingredients to automatically publish the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the semantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and although desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging problem. Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data fields (source attributes). However, constructing a semantic model that explicitly describes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types is critical.",0
"Tasks such as record linkage and multi-target tracking, which involve reconstructing the set of objects that underlie some observed data, are particularly challenging for probabilistic inference. Recent work has achieved efficient and accurate inference on such problems using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with customized proposal distributions. Currently, implementing such a system requires coding MCMC state representations and acceptance probability calculations that are specific to a particular application. An alternative approach, which we pursue in this paper, is to use a general-purpose probabilistic modeling language (such as BLOG) and a generic Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm that supports user-supplied proposal distributions. Our algorithm gains flexibility by using MCMC states that are only partial descriptions of possible worlds; we provide conditions under which MCMC over partial worlds yields correct answers to queries. We also show how to use a context-specific Bayes net to identify the factors in the acceptance probability that need to be computed for a given proposed move. Experimental results on a citation matching task show that our general-purpose MCMC engine compares favorably with an application-specific system.",0
"This paper proposes a novel, algorithm-independent approach to optimizing belief network inference. rather than designing optimizations on an algorithm by algorithm basis, we argue that one should use an unoptimized algorithm to generate a Q-DAG, a compiled graphical representation of the belief network, and then optimize the Q-DAG and its evaluator instead. We present a set of Q-DAG optimizations that supplant optimizations designed for traditional inference algorithms, including zero compression, network pruning and caching. We show that our Q-DAG optimizations require time linear in the Q-DAG size, and significantly simplify the process of designing algorithms for optimizing belief network inference.",0
"We propose the PeerRank method for peer assessment. This constructs a grade for an agent based on the grades proposed by the agents evaluating the agent. Since the grade of an agent is a measure of their ability to grade correctly, the PeerRank method weights grades by the grades of the grading agent. The PeerRank method also provides an incentive for agents to grade correctly. As the grades of an agent depend on the grades of the grading agents, and as these grades themselves depend on the grades of other agents, we define the PeerRank method by a fixed point equation similar to the PageRank method for ranking web-pages. We identify some formal properties of the PeerRank method (for example, it satisfies axioms of unanimity, no dummy, no discrimination and symmetry), discuss some examples, compare with related work and evaluate the performance on some synthetic data. Our results show considerable promise, reducing the error in grade predictions by a factor of 2 or more in many cases over the natural baseline of averaging peer grades.",0
"How can we design good goals for arbitrarily intelligent agents? Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural approach. Unfortunately, RL does not work well for generally intelligent agents, as RL agents are incentivised to shortcut the reward sensor for maximum reward -- the so-called wireheading problem. In this paper we suggest an alternative to RL called value reinforcement learning (VRL). In VRL, agents use the reward signal to learn a utility function. The VRL setup allows us to remove the incentive to wirehead by placing a constraint on the agent's actions. The constraint is defined in terms of the agent's belief distributions, and does not require an explicit specification of which actions constitute wireheading.",0
"Domain-independent planning is one of the foundational areas in the field of Artificial Intelligence. A description of a planning task consists of an initial world state, a goal, and a set of actions for modifying the world state. The objective is to find a sequence of actions, that is, a plan, that transforms the initial world state into a goal state. In optimal planning, we are interested in finding not just a plan, but one of the cheapest plans. A prominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic state-space search, guided by admissible heuristic functions. Numerous admissible heuristics have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and it is well known that there is no single ""best heuristic for optimal planning in general. Thus, which heuristic to choose for a given planning task is a difficult question. This difficulty can be avoided by combining several heuristics, but that requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each state, and the tradeoff between the time spent doing so and the time saved by the combined advantages of the different heuristics might be high. We present a novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for optimal planning, while maintaining its benefits. Using an idealized search space model, we formulate a decision rule for choosing the best heuristic to compute at each state. We then present an active online learning approach for learning a classifier with that decision rule as the target concept, and employ the learned classifier to decide which heuristic to compute at each state. We evaluate this technique empirically, and show that it substantially outperforms the standard method for combining several heuristics via their pointwise maximum.",0
"Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling technique that iteratively samples variables from their conditional distributions. There are two common scan orders for the variables: random scan and systematic scan. Due to the benefits of locality in hardware, systematic scan is commonly used, even though most statistical guarantees are only for random scan. While it has been conjectured that the mixing times of random scan and systematic scan do not differ by more than a logarithmic factor, we show by counterexample that this is not the case, and we prove that that the mixing times do not differ by more than a polynomial factor under mild conditions. To prove these relative bounds, we introduce a method of augmenting the state space to study systematic scan using conductance.",1
"We analyse a quantum-like Bayesian Network that puts together cause/effect relationships and semantic similarities between events. These semantic similarities constitute acausal connections according to the Synchronicity principle and provide new relationships to quantum like probabilistic graphical models. As a consequence, beliefs (or any other event) can be represented in vector spaces, in which quantum parameters are determined by the similarities that these vectors share between them. Events attached by a semantic meaning do not need to have an explanation in terms of cause and effect.",0
"To bridge the gap between humans and machines in image understanding and describing, we need further insight into how people describe a perceived scene. In this paper, we study the agreement between bottom-up saliency-based visual attention and object referrals in scene description constructs. We investigate the properties of human-written descriptions and machine-generated ones. We then propose a saliency-boosted image captioning model in order to investigate benefits from low-level cues in language models. We learn that (1) humans mention more salient objects earlier than less salient ones in their descriptions, (2) the better a captioning model performs, the better attention agreement it has with human descriptions, (3) the proposed saliency-boosted model, compared to its baseline form, does not improve significantly on the MS COCO database, indicating explicit bottom-up boosting does not help when the task is well learnt and tuned on a data, (4) a better generalization ability is, however, observed for the saliency-boosted model on unseen data.",0
"The capability to store data about business processes execution in so-called Event Logs has brought to the diffusion of tools for the analysis of process executions and for the assessment of the goodness of a process model. Nonetheless, these tools are often very rigid in dealing with with Event Logs that include incomplete information about the process execution. Thus, while the ability of handling incomplete event data is one of the challenges mentioned in the process mining manifesto, the evaluation of compliance of an execution trace still requires an end-to-end complete trace to be performed.",0
"We propose Deep Optimistic Linear Support Learning (DOL) to solve high-dimensional multi-objective decision problems where the relative importances of the objectives are not known a priori. Using features from the high-dimensional inputs, DOL computes the convex coverage set containing all potential optimal solutions of the convex combinations of the objectives. To our knowledge, this is the first time that deep reinforcement learning has succeeded in learning multi-objective policies. In addition, we provide a testbed with two experiments to be used as a benchmark for deep multi-objective reinforcement learning.",0
"Nearly 15 years ago, a set of qualitative spatial relations between oriented straight line segments (dipoles) was suggested by Schlieder. This work received substantial interest amongst the qualitative spatial reasoning community. However, it turned out to be difficult to establish a sound constraint calculus based on these relations. In this paper, we present the results of a new investigation into dipole constraint calculi which uses algebraic methods to derive sound results on the composition of relations and other properties of dipole calculi. Our results are based on a condensed semantics of the dipole relations.",0
"This paper is the continuation of our research work about linguistic truth-valued concept lattice. In order to provide a mathematical tool for mining tacit knowledge, we establish a concrete model of 6-ary linguistic truth-valued concept lattice and introduce a mining algorithm through the structure consistency. Specifically, we utilize the attributes to depict knowledge, propose the 6-ary linguistic truth-valued attribute extended context and congener context to characterize tacit knowledge, and research the necessary and sufficient conditions of forming tacit knowledge. We respectively give the algorithms of generating the linguistic truth-valued congener context and constructing the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice.",0

Besides, the proposed model searches to detect influencer users that adopt a positive opinion about the product, the idea, etc, to be propagated. Moreover, we present some experiments to show the performance of our model.",0
"A conceptual area is divided into units or barangays, each was allowed to evolve under a physical constraint. A risk assessment method was then used to identify the flood risk in each community using the following risk factors: the area's urbanized area ratio, literacy rate, mortality rate, poverty incidence, radio/TV penetration, and state of structural and non-structural measures. Vulnerability is defined as a weighted-sum of these components. A penalty was imposed for reduced vulnerability. Optimization comparison was done with MatLab's Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing; results showed 'extreme' solutions and realistic designs, for simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, respectively.",0
"POMDPs are standard models for probabilistic planning problems, where an agent interacts with an uncertain environment. We study the problem of almost-sure reachability, where given a set of target states, the question is to decide whether there is a policy to ensure that the target set is reached with probability 1 (almost-surely). While in general the problem is EXPTIME-complete, in many practical cases policies with a small amount of memory suffice. Moreover, the existing solution to the problem is explicit, which first requires to construct explicitly an exponential reduction to a belief-support MDP. In this work, we first study the existence of observation-stationary strategies, which is NP-complete, and then small-memory strategies. We present a symbolic algorithm by an efficient encoding to SAT and using a SAT solver for the problem. We report experimental results demonstrating the scalability of our symbolic (SAT-based) approach.",1
"If a robot is supposed to roam an environment and interact with objects, it is often necessary to know all possible objects in advance, so that a database with models of all objects can be generated for visual identification. However, this constraint cannot always be fulfilled. Due to that reason, a model based object recognition cannot be used to guide the robot's interactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a system that analyzes features of encountered objects and then uses these features to compare unknown objects to already known ones. From the resulting similarity appropriate actions can be derived. Moreover, the system enables the robot to learn object categories by grouping similar objects or by splitting existing categories. To represent the knowledge a hybrid form is used, consisting of both symbolic and subsymbolic representations.",0

"The integration of Linked Open Data (LOD) content in Web pages is a challenging and sometimes tedious task for Web developers. At the same moment, most software packages for blogs, content management systems (CMS), and shop applications support the consumption of feed formats, namely RSS and Atom. In this technical report, we demonstrate an on-line tool that fetches e-commerce data from a SPARQL endpoint and syndicates obtained results as RSS or Atom feeds. Our approach combines (1) the popularity and broad tooling support of existing feed formats, (2) the precision of queries against structured data built upon common Web vocabularies like schema.org, GoodRelations, FOAF, VCard, and WGS 84, and (3) the ease of integrating content from a large number of Web sites and other data sources in RDF in general.",0

"In a currently ongoing project, we investigate a new possibility for solving the k-labelled spanning forest (kLSF) problem by an intelligent Variable Neighbourhood Search (Int-VNS) metaheuristic. In the kLSF problem we are given an undirected input graph G and an integer positive value k, and the aim is to find a spanning forest of G having the minimum number of connected components and the upper bound k on the number of labels to use. The problem is related to the minimum labelling spanning tree (MLST) problem, whose goal is to get the spanning tree of the input graph with the minimum number of labels, and has several applications in the real world, where one aims to ensure connectivity by means of homogeneous connections. The Int-VNS metaheuristic that we propose for the kLSF problem is derived from the promising intelligent VNS strategy recently proposed for the MLST problem, and integrates the basic VNS for the kLSF problem with other complementary approaches from machine learning, statistics and experimental algorithmics, in order to produce high-quality performance and to completely automate the resulting strategy.",0
"We mathematically model Ignacio Matte Blanco's principles of {\em symmetric} and {\em asymmetric being} through use of an ultrametric topology. We use for this the highly regarded 1975 book of this Chilean psychiatrist and pyschoanalyst (born 1908, died 1995). Such an ultrametric model corresponds to hierarchical clustering in the empirical data, e.g. text. We show how an ultrametric topology can be used as a mathematical model for the structure of the logic that reflects or expresses Matte Blanco's symmetric being, and hence of the reasoning and thought processes involved in conscious reasoning or in reasoning that is lacking, perhaps entirely, in consciousness or awareness of itself. In a companion paper we study how symmetric (in the sense of Matte Blanco's) reasoning can be demarcated in a context of symmetric and asymmetric reasoning provided by narrative text.",0
"In this work I propose the conjecture that, within a cognitive system, it is possible to represent only the structure of objects and phenomena of the external reality. I suggest a methodology to handle the concepts of structure and scheme, and to carry out on them operations of structural analysis. These operations will allow the first transitions from concrete to abstract representations. With these tools, I suggest a definition for the concepts of rules and emergent phenomena. I analyze some aspects of the concept of rule and I propose to distinguish between operational and associative rules. I suggest that associative rules have a prevalent function in the cognitive activity. I also propose a definition for the concept of problem. I finally illustrate how to handle and finalize the cognitive activities.",0
"The concept of ""task"" is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI) --- the raison d'\^etre of AI systems. Tasks are used in system evaluation, pedagogy and decision making (through task decomposition and subtask selection). Other fields have strong theories of tasks in their domain that allows them to thoroughly evaluate their designs by methodical manipulation of well understood parameters of known importance; this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the effects of wind speed on an airplane's stability. No framework exists that allows the kind of methodical manipulation found in other disciplines: Results on the few tasks in current use (c.f. board games, question-answering) cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. A task theory would address this by providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks, environments, and their parameters, enabling more rigorous ways of measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Furthermore, analysis and (de)construction of tasks can help teachers devise appropriate challenges for learning systems, and help AI systems make more informed decisions about what (sub)tasks to pursue. Here we discuss the main elements of this argument and propose what such a theory might look like for physical tasks.",0
"This paper presents a theoretical, idealized model of the thinking process with the following characteristics: 1) the model can produce complex thought sequences and can be generalized to new inputs, 2) it can receive and maintain input information indefinitely for generation of thoughts and later use, and 3) it supports learning while executing. The crux of the model lies within the concept of internal consistency, or the generated thoughts should always be consistent with the inputs from which they are created. Its merit, apart from the capability to generate new creative thoughts from internal mechanism, depends on the potential to help training to generalize better. This is consequently enabled by separating input information into several parts to be handled by different processing components with a focus mechanism to fetch information for each. This modularized view with focus binds the model with the computationally capable Turing machines. And as a final remark, this paper constructively shows that the computational complexity of the model is at least, if not surpass, that of a universal Turing machine.",0
"Nowadays ontologies present a growing interest in Data Fusion applications. As a matter of fact, the ontologies are seen as a semantic tool for describing and reasoning about sensor data, objects, relations and general domain theories. In addition, uncertainty is perhaps one of the most important characteristics of the data and information handled by Data Fusion. However, the fundamental nature of ontologies implies that ontologies describe only asserted and veracious facts of the world. Different probabilistic, fuzzy and evidential approaches already exist to fill this gap; this paper recaps the most popular tools. However none of the tools meets exactly our purposes. Therefore, we constructed a Dempster-Shafer ontology that can be imported into any specific domain ontology and that enables us to instantiate it in an uncertain manner. We also developed a Java application that enables reasoning about these uncertain ontological instances.",0
"Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models over all subsets a ground set of $N$ items. They have recently gained prominence in several applications that rely on ""diverse"" subsets. However, their applicability to large problems is still limited due to the $\mathcal O(N^3)$ complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning. We enable efficient sampling and learning for DPPs by introducing KronDPP, a DPP model whose kernel matrix decomposes as a tensor product of multiple smaller kernel matrices. This decomposition immediately enables fast exact sampling. But contrary to what one may expect, leveraging the Kronecker product structure for speeding up DPP learning turns out to be more difficult. We overcome this challenge, and derive batch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning the parameters of a KronDPP.",1
"Algorithms for learning distributions over weight-vectors, such as AROW were recently shown empirically to achieve state-of-the-art performance at various problems, with strong theoretical guaranties. Extending these algorithms to matrix models pose challenges since the number of free parameters in the covariance of the distribution scales as $n^4$ with the dimension $n$ of the matrix, and $n$ tends to be large in real applications. We describe, analyze and experiment with two new algorithms for learning distribution of matrix models. Our first algorithm maintains a diagonal covariance over the parameters and can handle large covariance matrices. The second algorithm factors the covariance to capture inter-features correlation while keeping the number of parameters linear in the size of the original matrix. We analyze both algorithms in the mistake bound model and show a superior precision performance of our approach over other algorithms in two tasks: retrieving similar images, and ranking similar documents. The factored algorithm is shown to attain faster convergence rate.",0
"Shepard's Universal Law of Generalization offered a compelling case for the first physics-like law in cognitive science that should hold for all intelligent agents in the universe. Shepard's account is based on a rational Bayesian model of generalization, providing an answer to the question of why such a law should emerge. Extending this account to explain how humans use multiple examples to make better generalizations requires an additional assumption, called the size principle: hypotheses that pick out fewer objects should make a larger contribution to generalization. The degree to which this principle warrants similarly law-like status is far from conclusive. Typically, evaluating this principle has not been straightforward, requiring additional assumptions. We present a new method for evaluating the size principle that is more direct, and apply this method to a diverse array of datasets. Our results provide support for the broad applicability of the size principle.",0
"We consider in this paper the formulation of approximate inference in Bayesian networks as a problem of exact inference on an approximate network that results from deleting edges (to reduce treewidth). We have shown in earlier work that deleting edges calls for introducing auxiliary network parameters to compensate for lost dependencies, and proposed intuitive conditions for determining these parameters. We have also shown that our method corresponds to IBP when enough edges are deleted to yield a polytree, and corresponds to some generalizations of IBP when fewer edges are deleted. In this paper, we propose a different criteria for determining auxiliary parameters based on optimizing the KL-divergence between the original and approximate networks. We discuss the relationship between the two methods for selecting parameters, shedding new light on IBP and its generalizations. We also discuss the application of our new method to approximating inference problems which are exponential in constrained treewidth, including MAP and nonmyopic value of information.",0
"We define a notion of rational closure for the logic SHIQ, which does not enjoys the finite model property, building on the notion of rational closure introduced by Lehmann and Magidor in [23]. We provide a semantic characterization of rational closure in SHIQ in terms of a preferential semantics, based on a finite rank characterization of minimal models. We show that the rational closure of a TBox can be computed in EXPTIME using entailment in SHIQ.",0
"A natural and established way to restrict the constraint satisfaction problem is to fix the relations that can be used to pose constraints; such a family of relations is called a constraint language. In this article, we study arc consistency, a heavily investigated inference method, and three extensions thereof from the perspective of constraint languages. We conduct a comparison of the studied methods on the basis of which constraint languages they solve, and we present new polynomial-time tractability results for singleton arc consistency, the most powerful method studied.",0
"The Particle Swarm Optimization Policy (PSO-P) has been recently introduced and proven to produce remarkable results on interacting with academic reinforcement learning benchmarks in an off-policy, batch-based setting. To further investigate the properties and feasibility on real-world applications, this paper investigates PSO-P on the so-called Industrial Benchmark (IB), a novel reinforcement learning (RL) benchmark that aims at being realistic by including a variety of aspects found in industrial applications, like continuous state and action spaces, a high dimensional, partially observable state space, delayed effects, and complex stochasticity. The experimental results of PSO-P on IB are compared to results of closed-form control policies derived from the model-based Recurrent Control Neural Network (RCNN) and the model-free Neural Fitted Q-Iteration (NFQ). Experiments show that PSO-P is not only of interest for academic benchmarks, but also for real-world industrial applications, since it also yielded the best performing policy in our IB setting. Compared to other well established RL techniques, PSO-P produced outstanding results in performance and robustness, requiring only a relatively low amount of effort in finding adequate parameters or making complex design decisions.",0
"General human action recognition requires understanding of various visual cues. In this paper, we propose a network architecture that computes and integrates the most important visual cues for action recognition: pose, motion, and the raw images. For the integration, we introduce a Markov chain model which adds cues successively. The resulting approach is efficient and applicable to action classification as well as to spatial and temporal action localization. The two contributions clearly improve the performance over respective baselines. The overall approach achieves state-of-the-art action classification performance on HMDB51, J-HMDB and NTU RGB+D datasets. Moreover, it yields state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action localization results on UCF101 and J-HMDB.",0
"Recently there has been an increasing trend to use deep learning frameworks for both 2D consumer images and for 3D medical images. However, there has been little effort to use deep frameworks for volumetric vascular segmentation. We wanted to address this by providing a freely available dataset of 12 annotated two-photon vasculature microscopy stacks. We demonstrated the use of deep learning framework consisting both 2D and 3D convolutional filters (ConvNet). Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture produced promising segmentation result. We derived the architectures from Lee et al. who used the ZNN framework initially designed for electron microscope image segmentation. We hope that by sharing our volumetric vasculature datasets, we will inspire other researchers to experiment with vasculature dataset and improve the used network architectures.",0
"Ontologies provide a formal description of concepts and their relationships in a knowledge domain. The goal of ontology alignment is to identify semantically matching concepts and relationships across independently developed ontologies that purport to describe the same knowledge. In order to handle the widest possible class of ontologies, many alignment algorithms rely on terminological and structural meth- ods, but the often fuzzy nature of concepts complicates the matching process. However, one area that should provide clear matching solutions due to its mathematical nature, is units of measurement. Several on- tologies for units of measurement are available, but there has been no attempt to align them, notwithstanding the obvious importance for tech- nical interoperability. We propose a general strategy to map these (and similar) ontologies by introducing MathML to accurately capture the semantic description of concepts specified therein. We provide mapping results for three ontologies, and show that our approach improves on lexical comparisons.",0

"Real-time parking occupancy information is critical for a parking management system to facilitate drivers to park more efficiently. Recent advances in connected and automated vehicle technologies enable sensor-equipped cars (probe cars) to detect and broadcast available parking spaces when driving through parking lots. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of market penetration of probe cars on the system performance, and investigate different parking guidance policies to improve the data acquisition process. We adopt a simulation-based approach to impose four policies on an off- street parking lot influencing the behavior of probe cars to park in assigned parking spaces. This in turn effects the scanning route and the parking space occupancy estimations. The last policy we propose is a near-optimal guidance strategy that maximizes the information gain of posteriors. The results suggest that an efficient information gathering policy can compensate for low penetration of connected and automated vehicles. We also highlight the policy trade-off that occur while attempting to maximize information gain through explorations and improve assignment accuracy through exploitations. Our results can assist urban policy makers in designing and managing smart parking systems.",0
"It is well-known that the notion of (strong) conditional independence (CI) is too restrictive to capture independencies that only hold in certain contexts. This kind of contextual independency, called context-strong independence (CSI), can be used to facilitate the acquisition, representation, and inference of probabilistic knowledge. In this paper, we suggest the use of contextual weak independence (CWI) in Bayesian networks. It should be emphasized that the notion of CWI is a more general form of contextual independence than CSI. Furthermore, if the contextual strong independence holds for all contexts, then the notion of CSI becomes strong CI. On the other hand, if the weak contextual independence holds for all contexts, then the notion of CWI becomes weak independence (WI) nwhich is a more general noncontextual independency than strong CI. More importantly, complete axiomatizations are studied for both the class of WI and the class of CI and WI together. Finally, the interesting property of WI being a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring consistency in granular probabilistic networks is shown.",0
"Problem: This paper addresses the design of an intelligent software system for the IC (incident commander) of a team in order to coordinate actions of agents (field units or robots) in the domain of emergency/crisis response operations.

Results define a framework for future works to develop this system.",0
We present an approach to generate novel computer game levels that blend different game concepts in an unsupervised fashion. Our primary contribution is an analogical reasoning process to construct blends between level design models learned from gameplay videos. The models represent probabilistic relationships between elements in the game. An analogical reasoning process maps features between two models to produce blended models that can then generate new level chunks. As a proof-of-concept we train our system on the classic platformer game Super Mario Bros. due to its highly-regarded and well understood level design. We evaluate the extent to which the models represent stylistic level design knowledge and demonstrate the ability of our system to explain levels that were blended by human expert designers.,0
"Human disease diagnosis is a complicated process and requires high level of expertise. Any attempt of developing a web-based expert system dealing with human disease diagnosis has to overcome various difficulties. This paper describes a project work aiming to develop a web-based fuzzy expert system for diagnosing human diseases.

Causal models are intuitive for human users and, more importantly, support the prediction of the effect of manipulation.

"By analyzing the relationships among chance, weight of evidence and degree of beliefwe show that the assertion ""probability functions are special cases of belief functions"" and the assertion ""Dempster's rule can be used to combine belief functions based on distinct bodies of evidence"" together lead to an inconsistency in Dempster-Shafer theory. To solve this problem, we must reject some fundamental postulates of the theory. We introduce a new approach for uncertainty management that shares many intuitive ideas with D-S theory, while avoiding this problem.",0
"Research on distributed machine learning algorithms has focused primarily on one of two extremes - algorithms that obey strict concurrency constraints or algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conflicts are unlikely and if conflicts do arise a conflict-resolution protocol is invoked. We view this ""optimistic concurrency control"" paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment.",1
"Eliciting preferences of a decision maker is a key factor to successfully combine search and decision making in an interactive method. Therefore, the progressively integration and simulation of the decision maker is a main concern in an application. We contribute in this direction by proposing an interactive method based on a reference point-based guided local search to the bi-objective Inventory Routing Problem. A local search metaheuristic, working on the delivery intervals, and the Clarke &amp; Wright savings heuristic is employed for the subsequently obtained Vehicle Routing Problem. To elicit preferences, the decision maker selects a reference point to guide the search in interesting subregions. Additionally, the reference point is used as a reservation point to discard solutions outside the cone, introduced as a convergence criterion. Computational results of the reference point-based guided local search are reported and analyzed on benchmark data in order to show the applicability of the approach.",0
"This paper develops a simple calculus for order of magnitude reasoning. A semantics is given with soundness and completeness results. Order of magnitude probability functions are easily defined and turn out to be equivalent to kappa functions, which are slight generalizations of Spohn's Natural Conditional Functions. The calculus also gives rise to an order of magnitude decision theory, which can be used to justify an amended version of Pearl's decision theory for kappa functions, although the latter is weaker and less expressive.",0
"Time-frequency methods for vibration-based gearbox faults detection have been considered the most efficient method. Among these methods, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both stationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of overlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of redundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or misinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact Wavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion in case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have been implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor acquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir University of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and chipped tooth gears conditions. Kernelized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis functions has used the extracted features from exact wavelet analysis for classification. The efficiency of this classifier is then evaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show that in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in feature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO exact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact wavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and crossover in PSO algorithm. SVM classifier with the extracted features in gearbox shows very good results and its ability has been proved.",0
"We introduce a novel framework for evaluating multimodal deep learning models with respect to their language understanding and generalization abilities. In this approach, artificial data is automatically generated according to the experimenter's specifications. The content of the data, both during training and evaluation, can be controlled in detail, which enables tasks to be created that require true generalization abilities, in particular the combination of previously introduced concepts in novel ways. We demonstrate the potential of our methodology by evaluating various visual question answering models on four different tasks, and show how our framework gives us detailed insights into their capabilities and limitations. By open-sourcing our framework, we hope to stimulate progress in the field of multimodal language understanding.",0
"We describe algorithms for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data. The algorithms have two components: a scoring metric and a search procedure. The scoring metric takes a network structure, statistical data, and a user's prior knowledge, and returns a score proportional to the posterior probability of the network structure given the data. The search procedure generates networks for evaluation by the scoring metric. Our contributions are threefold. First, we identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parameter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowledge. In particular, a user can express her knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain. Second, we describe local search and annealing algorithms to be used in conjunction with scoring metrics. In the special case where each node has at most one parent, we show that heuristic search can be replaced with a polynomial algorithm to identify the networks with the highest score. Third, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms. We apply this approach to a comparison of metrics and search procedures.",0
"Use of Control theory within process control industries has changed rapidly due to the increase complexity of instrumentation, real time requirements, minimization of operating costs and highly nonlinear characteristics of chemical process. Previously developed process control technologies which are mostly based on a single controller are not efficient in terms of signal transmission delays, processing power for computational needs and signal to noise ratio. Hybrid controller with efficient system modelling is essential to cope with the current challenges of process control in terms of control performance. This paper presents an optimized mathematical modelling and advance hybrid controller (Fuzzy Logic and PID) design along with practical implementation and validation of pH neutralization pilot plant. This procedure is particularly important for control design and automation of Physico-chemical systems for process control industry.",0
"Within the area of computational models of argumentation, the instantiation-based approach is gaining more and more attention, not at least because meaningful input for Dung's abstract frameworks is provided in that way. In a nutshell, the aim of instantiation-based argumentation is to form, from a given knowledge base, a set of arguments and to identify the conflicts between them. The resulting network is then evaluated by means of extension-based semantics on an abstract level, i.e. on the resulting graph. While several systems are nowadays available for the latter step, the automation of the instantiation process itself has received less attention. In this work, we provide a novel approach to construct and visualize an argumentation framework from a given knowledge base. The system we propose relies on Answer-Set Programming and follows a two-step approach. A first program yields the logic-based arguments as its answer-sets; a second program is then used to specify the relations between arguments based on the answer-sets of the first program. As it turns out, this approach not only allows for a flexible and extensible tool for instantiation-based argumentation, but also provides a new method for answer-set visualization in general.",0
"Traditionally psychometric tests were used for profiling incoming workers. These methods use DISC profiling method to classify people into distinct personality types, which are further used to predict if a person may be a possible fit to the organizational culture. This concept is taken further by introducing a novel technique to predict if a particular pair of an incoming worker and the manager being assigned are compatible at a psychological scale. This is done using multilayer perceptron neural network which can be adaptively trained to showcase the true nature of the compatibility index. The proposed prototype model is used to quantify the relevant attributes, use them to train the prediction engine, and to define the data pipeline required for it.",0
"Local consistencies stronger than arc consistency have received a lot of attention since the early days of CSP research. %because of the strong pruning they can achieve. However, they have not been widely adopted by CSP solvers. This is because applying such consistencies can sometimes result in considerably smaller search tree sizes and therefore in important speed-ups, but in other cases the search space reduction may be small, causing severe run time penalties. Taking advantage of recent advances in parallelization, we propose a novel approach for the application of strong local consistencies (SLCs) that can improve their performance by largely preserving the speed-ups they offer in cases where they are successful, and eliminating the run time penalties in cases where they are unsuccessful. This approach is presented in the form of two search algorithms. Both algorithms consist of a master search process, which is a typical CSP solver, and a number of slave processes, with each one implementing a SLC method. The first algorithm runs the different SLCs synchronously at each node of the search tree explored in the master process, while the second one can run them asynchronously at different nodes of the search tree. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.",0
"Sequential decision tasks with incomplete information are characterized by the exploration problem; namely the trade-off between further exploration for learning more about the environment and immediate exploitation of the accrued information for decision-making. Within artificial intelligence, there has been an increasing interest in studying planning-while-learning algorithms for these decision tasks. In this paper we focus on the exploration problem in reinforcement learning and Q-learning in particular. The existing exploration strategies for Q-learning are of a heuristic nature and they exhibit limited scaleability in tasks with large (or infinite) state and action spaces. Efficient experimentation is needed for resolving uncertainties when possible plans are compared (i.e. exploration). The experimentation should be sufficient for selecting with statistical significance a locally optimal plan (i.e. exploitation). For this purpose, we develop a probabilistic hill-climbing algorithm that uses a statistical selection procedure to decide how much exploration is needed for selecting a plan which is, with arbitrarily high probability, arbitrarily close to a locally optimal one. Due to its generality the algorithm can be employed for the exploration strategy of robust Q-learning. An experiment on a relatively complex control task shows that the proposed exploration strategy performs better than a typical exploration strategy.",0
"Many real incidents demonstrate that users of Online Social Networks need mechanisms that help them manage their interactions by increasing the awareness of the different contexts that coexist in Online Social Networks and preventing them from exchanging inappropriate information in those contexts or disseminating sensitive information from some contexts to others. Contextual integrity is a privacy theory that conceptualises the appropriateness of information sharing based on the contexts in which this information is to be shared. Computational models of Contextual Integrity assume the existence of well-defined contexts, in which individuals enact pre-defined roles and information sharing is governed by an explicit set of norms. However, contexts in Online Social Networks are known to be implicit, unknown a priori and ever changing; users relationships are constantly evolving; and the information sharing norms are implicit. This makes current Contextual Integrity models not suitable for Online Social Networks.",0
"We observe a trend regarding restart strategies used in SAT solvers. A few years ago, most state-of-the-art solvers restarted on average after a few thousands of backtracks. Currently, restarting after a dozen backtracks results in much better performance. The main reason for this trend is that heuristics and data structures have become more restart-friendly. We expect further continuation of this trend, so future SAT solvers will restart even more rapidly. Additionally, we present experimental results to support our observations.",0
"Case-based planning can take advantage of former problem-solving experiences by storing in a plan library previously generated plans that can be reused to solve similar planning problems in the future. Although comparative worst-case complexity analyses of plan generation and reuse techniques reveal that it is not possible to achieve provable efficiency gain of reuse over generation, we show that the case-based planning approach can be an effective alternative to plan generation when similar reuse candidates can be chosen.",0
"This paper investigates a new method for improving the learning algorithm of Mixture of Experts (ME) model using a hybrid of Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS) and Conjugate Gradient (CG) as a second order optimization technique. The CG technique is combined with Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm to yield a much more efficient learning algorithm for ME structure. In addition, the experts and gating networks in enhanced model are replaced by CG based Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to provide faster and more accurate learning. The CG is considerably depends on initial weights of connections of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), so, a metaheuristic algorithm, the so-called Modified Cuckoo Search is applied in order to select the optimal weights. The performance of proposed method is compared with Gradient Decent Based ME (GDME) and Conjugate Gradient Based ME (CGME) in classification and regression problems. The experimental results show that hybrid MSC and CG based ME (MCS-CGME) has faster convergence and better performance in utilized benchmark data sets.",0
"Financial fraud detection is an important problem with a number of design aspects to consider. Issues such as algorithm selection and performance analysis will affect the perceived ability of proposed solutions, so for auditors and re-searchers to be able to sufficiently detect financial fraud it is necessary that these issues be thoroughly explored. In this paper we will revisit the key performance metrics used for financial fraud detection with a focus on credit card fraud, critiquing the prevailing ideas and offering our own understandings. There are many different performance metrics that have been employed in prior financial fraud detection research. We will analyse several of the popular metrics and compare their effectiveness at measuring the ability of detection mechanisms. We further investigated the performance of a range of computational intelligence techniques when applied to this problem domain, and explored the efficacy of several binary classification methods.",0
"Much progress has been made towards the goal of developing ML systems that are able to recognize and interpret visual scenes. With this paper, we propose query answering in visual-relational knowledge graphs (KGs) as a novel and important reasoning problem. A visual-relational KG is a KG whose entities are associated with image data. We introduce \textsc{ImageGraph}, a publicly available KG with 1330 relation types, 14,870 entities, and 829,931 images. Visual-relational KGs naturally lead to several novel query types treating images as first-class citizens. We approach the query answering problems by combining ideas from the areas of KG embedding learning and deep learning for computer vision. The resulting ML models can answer queries such as \textit{""How are these two unseen images related to each other?""} We also explore a novel zero-shot learning scenario where an image of an entirely new entity is linked to entities of an existing visual-relational KG. An extensive set of experiments shows that the proposed deep neural networks are able to answer the visual-relational queries efficiently and accurately.",0
"Sentiment analysis on user reviews helps to keep track of user reactions towards products, and make advices to users about what to buy. State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90%. However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70%~80%, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis. We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews. Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.",0
"In this paper we propose an approximated structured prediction framework for large scale graphical models and derive message-passing algorithms for learning their parameters efficiently. We first relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on local entropy approximations and derive an efficient message-passing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the optimum for concave entropy approximations. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efficiently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an image denoising task. This task was previously solved by sharing parameters across cliques. In contrast, our algorithm is able to efficiently learn large number of parameters resulting in orders of magnitude better prediction.",0
"In this paper, we develop a novel paradigm, namely hypergraph shift, to find robust graph modes by probabilistic voting strategy, which are semantically sound besides the self-cohesiveness requirement in forming graph modes. Unlike the existing techniques to seek graph modes by shifting vertices based on pair-wise edges (i.e, an edge with $2$ ends), our paradigm is based on shifting high-order edges (hyperedges) to deliver graph modes. Specifically, we convert the problem of seeking graph modes as the problem of seeking maximizers of a novel objective function with the aim to generate good graph modes based on sifting edges in hypergraphs. As a result, the generated graph modes based on dense subhypergraphs may more accurately capture the object semantics besides the self-cohesiveness requirement. We also formally prove that our technique is always convergent. Extensive empirical studies on synthetic and real world data sets are conducted on clustering and graph matching. They demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform the existing techniques.",0
"Syntactic parsing, the process of obtaining the internal structure of sentences in natural languages, is a crucial task for artificial intelligence applications that need to extract meaning from natural language text or speech. Sentiment analysis is one example of application for which parsing has recently proven useful.",0
"The technique of kernelization consists in extracting, from an instance of a problem, an essentially equivalent instance whose size is bounded in a parameter k. Besides being the basis for efficient param-eterized algorithms, this method also provides a wealth of information to reason about in the context of constraint programming. We study the use of kernelization for designing propagators through the example of the Vertex Cover constraint. Since the classic kernelization rules often correspond to dominance rather than consistency, we introduce the notion of ""loss-less"" kernel. While our preliminary experimental results show the potential of the approach, they also show some of its limits. In particular, this method is more effective for vertex covers of large and sparse graphs, as they tend to have, relatively, smaller kernels.",0
"This paper defines the notion of analogical dissimilarity between four objects, with a special focus on objects structured as sequences. Firstly, it studies the case where the four objects have a null analogical dissimilarity, i.e. are in analogical proportion. Secondly, when one of these objects is unknown, it gives algorithms to compute it. Thirdly, it tackles the problem of defining analogical dissimilarity, which is a measure of how far four objects are from being in analogical proportion. In particular, when objects are sequences, it gives a definition and an algorithm based on an optimal alignment of the four sequences. It gives also learning algorithms, i.e. methods to find the triple of objects in a learning sample which has the least analogical dissimilarity with a given object. Two practical experiments are described: the first is a classification problem on benchmarks of binary and nominal data, the second shows how the generation of sequences by solving analogical equations enables a handwritten character recognition system to rapidly be adapted to a new writer.",0
"When an agent cannot represent a perfectly accurate model of its environment's dynamics, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can fail catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model; when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the model to ""correct"" itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach, illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error. These results inspire an MBRL algorithm for deterministic MDPs with performance guarantees that are robust to model class limitations.",1
"Mobile applications are being used every day by more than half of the world's population to perform a great variety of tasks. With the increasingly widespread usage of these applications, the need arises for efficient techniques to test them. Many frameworks allow automating the process of application testing, however existing frameworks mainly rely on the application developer for providing testing scripts for each developed application, thus preventing reuse of these tests for similar applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the automation of testing Android applications by leveraging machine learning techniques and reusing popular test scenarios. We discuss and demonstrate the potential benefits of our approach in an empirical study where we show that our developed testing tool, based on the proposed approach, outperforms standard methods in realistic settings.",0
"The FO Model Counting problem (FOMC) is the following: given a sentence $\Phi$ in FO and a number $n$, compute the number of models of $\Phi$ over a domain of size $n$; the Weighted variant (WFOMC) generalizes the problem by associating a weight to each tuple and defining the weight of a model to be the product of weights of its tuples. In this paper we study the complexity of the symmetric WFOMC, where all tuples of a given relation have the same weight. Our motivation comes from an important application, inference in Knowledge Bases with soft constraints, like Markov Logic Networks, but the problem is also of independent theoretical interest. We study both the data complexity, and the combined complexity of FOMC and WFOMC. For the data complexity we prove the existence of an FO$^{3}$ formula for which FOMC is #P$_1$-complete, and the existence of a Conjunctive Query for which WFOMC is #P$_1$-complete. We also prove that all $\gamma$-acyclic queries have polynomial time data complexity. For the combined complexity, we prove that, for every fragment FO$^{k}$, $k\geq 2$, the combined complexity of FOMC (or WFOMC) is #P-complete.",0
"On the one hand, Constraint Satisfaction Problems allow one to declaratively model problems. On the other hand, propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) solvers can handle huge SAT instances. We thus present a technique to declaratively model set constraint problems and to encode them automatically into SAT instances. We apply our technique to the Social Golfer Problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more declarative, and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved hand-written instances such as in [20], and with unit propagation they also contain less variables. Moreover, they are well-suited for SAT solvers and they are solved faster as shown when solving difficult instances of the Social Golfer Problem.",0
"This paper outlines a methodology for analyzing the representational support for knowledge-based decision-modeling in a broad domain. A relevant set of inference patterns and knowledge types are identified. By comparing the analysis results to existing representations, some insights are gained into a design approach for integrating categorical and uncertain knowledge in a context sensitive manner.",0
"Traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, even though widely applied, are not suited for massive data and large label scenarios since they scale linearly with the number of edges $|E|$ and distinct labels $m$. To deal with the large label size problem, recent works propose sketch-based methods to approximate the distribution on labels per node thereby achieving a space reduction from $O(m)$ to $O(\log m)$, under certain conditions. In this paper, we present a novel streaming graph-based SSL approximation that captures the sparsity of the label distribution and ensures the algorithm propagates labels accurately, and further reduces the space complexity per node to $O(1)$. We also provide a distributed version of the algorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the new method achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms with significant reduction in memory footprint. We also study different graph construction mechanisms for natural language applications and propose a robust graph augmentation strategy trained using state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning architectures that yields further significant quality gains.",0

"The term ""affordance"" denotes the behavioral meaning of objects. We propose a cognitive architecture for the detection of affordances in the visual modality. This model is based on the internal simulation of movement sequences. For each movement step, the resulting sensory state is predicted by a forward model, which in turn triggers the generation of a new (simulated) motor command by an inverse model. Thus, a series of mental images in the sensory and in the motor domain is evoked. Starting from a real sensory state, a large number of such sequences is simulated in parallel. Final affordance detection is based on the generated motor commands. We apply this model to a real-world mobile robot which is faced with obstacle arrangements some of which are passable (corridor) and some of which are not (dead ends). The robot's task is to detect the right affordance (""pass-through-able"" or ""non-pass-through-able""). The required internal models are acquired in a hierarchical training process. Afterwards, the robotic agent is able to distinguish reliably between corridors and dead ends. This real-world result enhances the validity of the proposed mental simulation approach. In addition, we compare several key factors in the simulation process regarding performance and efficiency.",0
"We discuss the computational complexity of approximating maximum a posteriori inference in sum-product networks. We first show NP-hardness in three-level trees by a reduction from maximum independent set; this implies non-approximability within a sublinear factor. We show that this is a tight bound, as we can find an approximation within a linear factor in three-level networks. We then show that in four-level trees it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $2^{f(n)}$ for any sublinear function $f$ of the size of the input $n$. Again, this is bound is tight, as we prove that the usual max-product algorithm finds (in any network) approximations within factor $2^{c n}$ from some constant $c &lt; 1$. Last, we present a simple algorithm, and show that it provably produces solutions at least as good as, and potentially much better than, the max-product algorithm.",0
"Semantic sparsity is a common challenge in structured visual classification problems; when the output space is complex, the vast majority of the possible predictions are rarely, if ever, seen in the training set. This paper studies semantic sparsity in situation recognition, the task of producing structured summaries of what is happening in images, including activities, objects and the roles objects play within the activity. For this problem, we find empirically that most object-role combinations are rare, and current state-of-the-art models significantly underperform in this sparse data regime. We avoid many such errors by (1) introducing a novel tensor composition function that learns to share examples across role-noun combinations and (2) semantically augmenting our training data with automatically gathered examples of rarely observed outputs using web data. When integrated within a complete CRF-based structured prediction model, the tensor-based approach outperforms existing state of the art by a relative improvement of 2.11% and 4.40% on top-5 verb and noun-role accuracy, respectively. Adding 5 million images with our semantic augmentation techniques gives further relative improvements of 6.23% and 9.57% on top-5 verb and noun-role accuracy.",0
"The main advantage of Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for sequential pattern mining (SPM) is their modularity, which includes the ability to add new constraints (regular expressions, length restrictions, etc). The current best CP approach for SPM uses a global constraint (module) that computes the projected database and enforces the minimum frequency; it does this with a filtering algorithm similar to the PrefixSpan method. However, the resulting system is not as scalable as some of the most advanced mining systems like Zaki's cSPADE. We show how, using techniques from both data mining and CP, one can use a generic constraint solver and yet outperform existing specialized systems. This is mainly due to two improvements in the module that computes the projected frequencies: first, computing the projected database can be sped up by pre-computing the positions at which an symbol can become unsupported by a sequence, thereby avoiding to scan the full sequence each time; and second by taking inspiration from the trailing used in CP solvers to devise a backtracking-aware data structure that allows fast incremental storing and restoring of the projected database. Detailed experiments show how this approach outperforms existing CP as well as specialized systems for SPM, and that the gain in efficiency translates directly into increased efficiency for other settings such as mining with regular expressions.",0
"Power grids are critical infrastructure assets that face non-technical losses (NTL) such as electricity theft or faulty meters. NTL may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed in emerging countries. Industrial NTL detection systems are still largely based on expert knowledge when deciding whether to carry out costly on-site inspections of customers. Electricity providers are reluctant to move to large-scale deployments of automated systems that learn NTL profiles from data due to the latter's propensity to suggest a large number of unnecessary inspections. In this paper, we propose a novel system that combines automated statistical decision making with expert knowledge. First, we propose a machine learning framework that classifies customers into NTL or non-NTL using a variety of features derived from the customers' consumption data. The methodology used is specifically tailored to the level of noise in the data. Second, in order to allow human experts to feed their knowledge in the decision loop, we propose a method for visualizing prediction results at various granularity levels in a spatial hologram. Our approach allows domain experts to put the classification results into the context of the data and to incorporate their knowledge for making the final decisions of which customers to inspect. This work has resulted in appreciable results on a real-world data set of 3.6M customers. Our system is being deployed in a commercial NTL detection software.",0
"Similes are natural language expressions used to compare unlikely things, where the comparison is not taken literally. They are often used in everyday communication and are an important part of cultural heritage. Having an up-to-date corpus of similes is challenging, as they are constantly coined and/or adapted to the contemporary times. In this paper we present a methodology for semi-automated collection of similes from the world wide web using text mining techniques. We expanded an existing corpus of traditional similes (containing 333 similes) by collecting 446 additional expressions. We, also, explore how crowdsourcing can be used to extract and curate new similes.",0
"While emerging deep-learning systems have outclassed knowledge-based approaches in many tasks, their application to detection tasks for autonomous technologies remains an open field for scientific exploration. Broadly, there are two major developmental bottlenecks: the unavailability of comprehensively labeled datasets and of expressive evaluation strategies. Approaches for labeling datasets have relied on intensive hand-engineering, and strategies for evaluating learning systems have been unable to identify failure-case scenarios. Human intelligence offers an untapped approach for breaking through these bottlenecks. This paper introduces Driverseat, a technology for embedding crowds around learning systems for autonomous driving. Driverseat utilizes crowd contributions for (a) collecting complex 3D labels and (b) tagging diverse scenarios for ready evaluation of learning systems. We demonstrate how Driverseat can crowdstrap a convolutional neural network on the lane-detection task. More generally, crowdstrapping introduces a valuable paradigm for any technology that can benefit from leveraging the powerful combination of human and computer intelligence.",0
"Learning-assisted automated reasoning has recently gained popularity among the users of Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light, and Mizar. In this paper, we present an add-on to the HOL4 proof assistant and an adaptation of the HOLyHammer system that provides machine learning-based premise selection and automated reasoning also for HOL4. We efficiently record the HOL4 dependencies and extract features from the theorem statements, which form a basis for premise selection. HOLyHammer transforms the HOL4 statements in the various TPTP-ATP proof formats, which are then processed by the ATPs. We discuss the different evaluation settings: ATPs, accessible lemmas, and premise numbers. We measure the performance of HOLyHammer on the HOL4 standard library. The results are combined accordingly and compared with the HOL Light experiments, showing a comparably high quality of predictions. The system directly benefits HOL4 users by automatically finding proofs dependencies that can be reconstructed by Metis.",0
"Discrete optimization is a central problem in artificial intelligence. The optimization of the aggregated cost of a network of cost functions arises in a variety of problems including (W)CSP, DCOP, as well as optimization in stochastic variants such as Bayesian networks. Inference-based algorithms are powerful techniques for solving discrete optimization problems, which can be used independently or in combination with other techniques. However, their applicability is often limited by their compute intensive nature and their space requirements. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a novel inference-based technique, which exploits modern massively parallel architectures, such as those found in Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), to speed up the resolution of exact and approximated inference-based algorithms for discrete optimization. The paper studies the proposed algorithm in both centralized and distributed optimization contexts. The paper demonstrates that the use of GPUs provides significant advantages in terms of runtime and scalability, achieving up to two orders of magnitude in speedups and showing a considerable reduction in execution time (up to 345 times faster) with respect to a sequential version.",0
"We consider the problem of designing the the utility functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers in the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many cases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's performance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small amounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not ""aligned"" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to 'side-effects', in this case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess' paradox.",0
"Feature engineering is one of the most important and time consuming tasks in predictive analytics projects. It involves understanding domain knowledge and data exploration to discover relevant hand-crafted features from raw data. In this paper, we introduce a system called One Button Machine, or OneBM for short, which automates feature discovery in relational databases. OneBM automatically performs a key activity of data scientists, namely, joining of database tables and applying advanced data transformations to extract useful features from data. We validated OneBM in Kaggle competitions in which OneBM achieved performance as good as top 16% to 24% data scientists in three Kaggle competitions. More importantly, OneBM outperformed the state-of-the-art system in a Kaggle competition in terms of prediction accuracy and ranking on Kaggle leaderboard. The results show that OneBM can be useful for both data scientists and non-experts. It helps data scientists reduce data exploration time allowing them to try and error many ideas in short time. On the other hand, it enables non-experts, who are not familiar with data science, to quickly extract value from their data with a little effort, time and cost.",0
"Experience replay is one of the most commonly used approaches to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, we propose an approach to select and replay sequences of transitions in order to accelerate the learning of a reinforcement learning agent in an off-policy setting. In addition to selecting appropriate sequences, we also artificially construct transition sequences using information gathered from previous agent-environment interactions. These sequences, when replayed, allow value function information to trickle down to larger sections of the state/state-action space, thereby making the most of the agent's experience. We demonstrate our approach on modified versions of standard reinforcement learning tasks such as the mountain car and puddle world problems and empirically show that it enables better learning of value functions as compared to other forms of experience replay. Further, we briefly discuss some of the possible extensions to this work, as well as applications and situations where this approach could be particularly useful.",0
"In this work we present SIFT, a 3-step algorithm for the analysis of the structural information represented by means of a taxonomy. The major advantage of this algorithm is the capability to leverage the information inherent to the hierarchical structures of taxonomies to infer correspondences which can allow to merge them in a later step. This method is particular relevant in scenarios where taxonomy alignment techniques exploiting textual information from taxonomy nodes cannot operate successfully.",0
"In Machine Learning, the parent set identification problem is to find a set of random variables that best explain selected variable given the data and some predefined scoring function. This problem is a critical component to structure learning of Bayesian networks and Markov blankets discovery, and thus has many practical applications ranging from fraud detection to clinical decision support. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed memory approach to the exact parent sets assignment problem. To achieve scalability, we derive theoretical bounds to constraint the search space when MDL scoring function is used, and we reorganize the underlying dynamic programming such that the computational density is increased and fine-grain synchronization is eliminated. We then design efficient realization of our approach in the Apache Spark platform. Through experimental results, we demonstrate that the method maintains strong scalability on a 500-core standalone Spark cluster, and it can be used to efficiently process data sets with 70 variables, far beyond the reach of the currently available solutions.",0
"The normalized edit distance is one of the distances derived from the edit distance. It is useful in some applications because it takes into account the lengths of the two strings compared. The normalized edit distance is not defined in terms of edit operations but rather in terms of the edit path. In this paper we propose a new derivative of the edit distance that also takes into consideration the lengths of the two strings, but the new distance is related directly to the edit distance. The particularity of the new distance is that it uses the genetic algorithms to set the values of the parameters it uses. We conduct experiments to test the new distance and we obtain promising results.",0
"Business process deviance refers to the phenomenon whereby a subset of the executions of a business process deviate, in a negative or positive way, with respect to its expected or desirable outcomes. Deviant executions of a business process include those that violate compliance rules, or executions that undershoot or exceed performance targets. Deviance mining is concerned with uncovering the reasons for deviant executions by analyzing business process event logs. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of deviance mining approaches based on a family of data mining techniques known as sequence classification. Using real-life logs from multiple domains, we evaluate a range of feature types and classification methods in terms of their ability to accurately discriminate between normal and deviant executions of a process. We also analyze the interestingness of the rule sets extracted using different methods. We observe that feature sets extracted using pattern mining techniques only slightly outperform simpler feature sets based on counts of individual activity occurrences in a trace.",0
"Software testing is an expensive process, which is vital in the industry. Construction of the test-data in software testing requires the major cost and to decide which method to use in order to generate the test data is important. This paper discusses the efficiency of search-based algorithms (preferably genetic algorithm) versus random testing, in soft- ware test-data generation. This study differs from all previous studies due to sample programs (SUTs) which are used. Since we want to in- crease the complexity of SUTs gradually, and the program generation is automatic as well, Grammatical Evolution is used to guide the program generation. SUTs are generated according to the grammar we provide, with different levels of complexity. SUTs will first undergo genetic al- gorithm and then random testing. Based on the test results, this paper recommends one method to use for automation of software testing.",0
"We present an alternative methodology for the analysis of algorithms, based on the concept of expected discounted reward. This methodology naturally handles algorithms that do not always terminate, so it can (theoretically) be used with partial algorithms for undecidable problems, such as those found in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and automated theorem proving. We mention new approaches to self-improving AGI and logical uncertainty enabled by this methodology.",0
"Higher-level cognition includes logical reasoning and the ability of question answering with common sense. Our RatioLog project addresses the problem of rational reasoning in deep question answering by methods from automated deduction and cognitive computing. In a first phase, we combine techniques from information retrieval and machine learning to find appropriate answer candidates from the huge amount of text in the German version of the free encyclopedia ""Wikipedia"". In a second phase, an automated theorem prover tries to verify the answer candidates on the basis of their logical representations. In a third phase - because the knowledge may be incomplete and inconsistent -, we consider extensions of logical reasoning to improve the results. In this context, we work toward application of techniques from human reasoning: We employ defeasible reasoning to compare the answers w.r.t. specificity, deontic logic, normative reasoning, and model construction. Moreover, we use integrated case-based reasoning and machine learning techniques on the basis of the semantic structure of the questions and answer candidates to learn giving the right answers.",0
"The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB) --- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks.",0
"Entity alignment is the task of finding entities in two knowledge bases (KBs) that represent the same real-world object. When facing KBs in different natural languages, conventional cross-lingual entity alignment methods rely on machine translation to eliminate the language barriers. These approaches often suffer from the uneven quality of translations between languages. While recent embedding-based techniques encode entities and relationships in KBs and do not need machine translation for cross-lingual entity alignment, a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a joint attribute-preserving embedding model for cross-lingual entity alignment. It jointly embeds the structures of two KBs into a unified vector space and further refines it by leveraging attribute correlations in the KBs. Our experimental results on real-world datasets show that this approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding approaches for cross-lingual entity alignment and could be complemented with methods based on machine translation.",0
"Acoustic models using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) capture the correlations within feature vectors using subspaces which do not vastly expand the model. This allows high dimensional and correlated feature spaces to be used, without requiring the estimation of multiple high dimension covariance matrices. In this letter we extend the recently presented PLDA mixture model for speech recognition through a tied PLDA approach, which is better able to control the model size to avoid overfitting. We carried out experiments using the Switchboard corpus, with both mel frequency cepstral coefficient features and bottleneck feature derived from a deep neural network. Reductions in word error rate were obtained by using tied PLDA, compared with the PLDA mixture model, subspace Gaussian mixture models, and deep neural networks.",0
Autonomous driving is one of the most recent topics of interest which is aimed at replicating human driving behavior keeping in mind the safety issues. We approach the problem of learning synthetic driving using generative neural networks. The main idea is to make a controller trainer network using images plus key press data to mimic human learning. We used the architecture of a stable GAN to make predictions between driving scenes using key presses. We train our model on one video game (Road Rash) and tested the accuracy and compared it by running the model on other maps in Road Rash to determine the extent of learning.,0
"An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) needs to acquire a certain degree of autonomy for any particular underwater mission to fulfill the mission objectives successfully and ensure its safety in all stages of the mission in a large scale operating filed. In this paper, a novel combinatorial conflict-free-task assignment strategy consisting an interactive engagement of a local path planner and an adaptive global route planner, is introduced. The method is established upon the heuristic search potency of the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to address the discrete nature of routing-task assignment approach and the complexity of NP-hard path planning problem. The proposed hybrid method is highly efficient for having a reactive guidance framework that guarantees successful completion of missions specifically in cluttered environments. To examine the performance of the method in a context of mission productivity, mission time management and vehicle safety, a series of simulation studies are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that the proposed method is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with uncertainties, and it can significantly enhance the level of vehicle's autonomy by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible solutions.",0
"In recent years researchers have achieved considerable success applying neural network methods to question answering (QA). These approaches have achieved state of the art results in simplified closed-domain settings such as the SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) dataset, which provides a pre-selected passage, from which the answer to a given question may be extracted. More recently, researchers have begun to tackle open-domain QA, in which the model is given a question and access to a large corpus (e.g., wikipedia) instead of a pre-selected passage (Chen et al., 2017a). This setting is more complex as it requires large-scale search for relevant passages by an information retrieval component, combined with a reading comprehension model that ""reads"" the passages to generate an answer to the question. Performance in this setting lags considerably behind closed-domain performance.",0
"The problem of automatically generating a computer program from some specification has been studied since the early days of AI. Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation.",1
"The competitive MNIST handwritten digit recognition benchmark has a long history of broken records since 1998. The most recent substantial improvement by others dates back 7 years (error rate 0.4%) . Recently we were able to significantly improve this result, using graphics cards to greatly speed up training of simple but deep MLPs, which achieved 0.35%, outperforming all the previous more complex methods. Here we report another substantial improvement: 0.31% obtained using a committee of MLPs.",0
"We present TorchCraft, an open-source library that enables deep learning research on Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games such as StarCraft: Brood War, by making it easier to control these games from a machine learning framework, here Torch. This white paper argues for using RTS games as a benchmark for AI research, and describes the design and components of TorchCraft.",0
"Wit is a quintessential form of rich inter-human interaction, and is often grounded in a specific situation (e.g., a comment in response to an event). In this work, we attempt to build computational models that can produce witty descriptions for a given image. Inspired by a cognitive account of humor appreciation, we employ linguistic wordplay, specifically puns. We compare our approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human studies. In a Turing test style evaluation, people find our model's description for an image to be wittier than a human's witty description 55% of the time!",0
"In this paper, a high-speed online neural network classifier based on extreme learning machines for multi-label classification is proposed. In multi-label classification, each of the input data sample belongs to one or more than one of the target labels. The traditional binary and multi-class classification where each sample belongs to only one target class forms the subset of multi-label classification. Multi-label classification problems are far more complex than binary and multi-class classification problems, as both the number of target labels and each of the target labels corresponding to each of the input samples are to be identified. The proposed work exploits the high-speed nature of the extreme learning machines to achieve real-time multi-label classification of streaming data. A new threshold-based online sequential learning algorithm is proposed for high speed and streaming data classification of multi-label problems. The proposed method is experimented with six different datasets from different application domains such as multimedia, text, and biology. The hamming loss, accuracy, training time and testing time of the proposed technique is compared with nine different state-of-the-art methods. Experimental studies shows that the proposed technique outperforms the existing multi-label classifiers in terms of performance and speed.",0
"This paper introduces an elemental building block which combines Dictionary Learning and Dimension Reduction (DRDL). We show how this foundational element can be used to iteratively construct a Hierarchical Sparse Representation (HSR) of a sensory stream. We compare our approach to existing models showing the generality of our simple prescription. We then perform preliminary experiments using this framework, illustrating with the example of an object recognition task using standard datasets. This work introduces the very first steps towards an integrated framework for designing and analyzing various computational tasks from learning to attention to action. The ultimate goal is building a mathematically rigorous, integrated theory of intelligence.",0
"The RoboCup 2D Simulation League incorporates several challenging features, setting a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper we describe some of the ideas and tools around the development of our team, Gliders2012. In our description, we focus on the evaluation function as one of our central mechanisms for action selection. We also point to a new framework for watching log files in a web browser that we release for use and further development by the RoboCup community. Finally, we also summarize results of the group and final matches we played during RoboCup 2012, with Gliders2012 finishing 4th out of 19 teams.",0
"The AGM theory of belief revision has become an important paradigm for investigating rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have restricted much of their attention to rather simple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sentences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contraction. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is conditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expansion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered probabilistic expansion.",0
"Real-world multi-agent planning problems cannot be solved using decision-theoretic planning methods due to the exponential complexity. We approximate firefighting in rescue simulation as a spatially distributed task and model with multi-agent Markov decision process. We use recent approximation methods for spatial task problems to reduce the model complexity. Our approximations are single-agent, static task, shortest path pruning, dynamic planning horizon, and task clustering. We create scenarios from RoboCup Rescue Simulation maps and evaluate our methods on these graph worlds. The results show that our approach is faster and better than comparable methods and has negligible performance loss compared to the optimal policy. We also show that our method has a similar performance as DCOP methods on example RCRS scenarios.",0
"We present a novel approach to deformable object manipulation that does not rely on highly-accurate modeling. The key contribution of this paper is to formulate the task as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, with each arm representing a model of the deformable object. To ""pull"" an arm and evaluate its utility, we use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models. We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on synthetic trials, and performs competitively on several manipulation tasks in simulation.",0
"Separable Bayesian Networks, or the Influence Model, are dynamic Bayesian Networks in which the conditional probability distribution can be separated into a function of only the marginal distribution of a node's neighbors, instead of the joint distributions. In terms of modeling, separable networks has rendered possible siginificant reduction in complexity, as the state space is only linear in the number of variables on the network, in contrast to a typical state space which is exponential. In this work, We describe the connection between an arbitrary Conditional Probability Table (CPT) and separable systems using linear algebra. We give an alternate proof on the equivalence of sufficiency and separability. We present a computational method for testing whether a given CPT is separable.",0
Model-based diagnosis reasons backwards from a functional schematic of a system to isolate faults given observations of anomalous behavior. We develop a fully probabilistic approach to model based diagnosis and extend it to support hierarchical models. Our scheme translates the functional schematic into a Bayesian network and diagnostic inference takes place in the Bayesian network. A Bayesian network diagnostic inference algorithm is modified to take advantage of the hierarchy to give computational gains.,0
"This paper addresses the problem of practical privacy-preserving machine learning: how to detect patterns in massive, real-world databases of sensitive personal information, while maintaining the privacy of individuals. Chaudhuri and Monteleoni (2008) recently provided privacy-preserving techniques for learning linear separators via regularized logistic regression. With the goal of handling large databases that may not be linearly separable, we provide privacy-preserving support vector machine algorithms.",0
This study describes the experimental application of Machine Learning techniques to build prediction models that can assess the injury risk associated with traffic accidents. This work uses an freely available data set of traffic accident records that took place in the city of Porto Alegre/RS (Brazil) during the year of 2013. This study also provides an analysis of the most important attributes of a traffic accident that could produce an outcome of injury to the people involved in the accident.,0
"Web service composition is the process of synthesizing a new composite service using a set of available Web services in order to satisfy a client request that cannot be treated by any available Web services. The Web services space is a dynamic environment characterized by a huge number of elements. Furthermore, many Web services are offering similar functionalities. In this paper we propose a model for Web service composition designed to address the scale effect and the redundancy issue. The Web services space is represented by a two-layered network architecture. A concrete similarity network layer organizes the Web services operations into communities of functionally similar operations. An abstract interaction network layer represents the composition relationships between the sets of communities. Composition synthesis is performed by a two-phased graph search algorithm. First, the interaction network is mined in order to discover abstract solutions to the request goal. Then, the abstract compositions are instantiated with concrete operations selected from the similarity network. This strategy allows an efficient exploration of the Web services space. Furthermore, operations grouped in a community can be easily substituted if necessary during the composition's synthesis's process.",0
"In this work, we introduce a dataset of video annotated with high quality natural language phrases describing the visual content in a given segment of time. Our dataset is based on the Descriptive Video Service (DVS) that is now encoded on many digital media products such as DVDs. DVS is an audio narration describing the visual elements and actions in a movie for the visually impaired. It is temporally aligned with the movie and mixed with the original movie soundtrack. We describe an automatic DVS segmentation and alignment method for movies, that enables us to scale up the collection of a DVS-derived dataset with minimal human intervention. Using this method, we have collected the largest DVS-derived dataset for video description of which we are aware. Our dataset currently includes over 84.6 hours of paired video/sentences from 92 DVDs and is growing.",0
"Qualitative calculi play a central role in representing and reasoning about qualitative spatial and temporal knowledge. This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong $n$-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of $n\geq 3$ relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra. Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a large number of variables.",0
"Nowadays, there is increasing interest in the development of teamwork skills in the educational context. This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin's role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction.",0
"In multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems, ratings are assigned to the alternatives on different criteria by the expert group. In this paper, we propose a thermodynamically consistent model for MCDM using the analogies for thermodynamical indicators - energy, exergy and entropy. The most commonly used method for analysing MCDM problem is Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The conventional TOPSIS method uses a measure similar to that of energy for the ranking of alternatives. We demonstrate that the ranking of the alternatives is more meaningful if we use exergy in place of energy. The use of exergy is superior due to the inclusion of a factor accounting for the quality of the ratings by the expert group. The unevenness in the ratings by the experts is measured by entropy. The procedure for the calculation of the thermodynamical indicators is explained in both crisp and fuzzy environment. Finally, two case studies are carried out to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed model.",0
We address a problem of area protection in graph-based scenarios with multiple mobile agents where connectivity is maintained among agents to ensure they can communicate. The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices. The team of defenders need to maintain connectivity of vertices occupied by its own agents in a visibility graph. The visibility graph models possibility of communication between pairs of vertices.,0
"Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention recently due to its several applications in distributed, web-based learning problems. In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity.",1
"Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide. However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and characterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence of mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches to supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived from social media content provides a potential means for near real-time estimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting, evaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and interventions.",0
"Sequence models can be trained using supervised learning and a next-step prediction objective. This approach, however, suffers from known failure modes. For example, it is notoriously difficult to ensure multi-step generated sequences have coherent global structure. Motivated by the fact that reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to impose arbitrary properties on generated data by choosing appropriate reward functions, in this paper we propose a novel approach for sequence training which combines Maximum Likelihood (ML) and RL training. We refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from stochastic optimal control (SOC). We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note-RNN is then refined using RL, where the reward function is a combination of rewards based on rules of music theory, as well as the output of another trained Note-RNN. We show that by combining ML and RL, this RL Tuner method can not only produce more pleasing melodies, but that it can significantly reduce unwanted behaviors and failure modes of the RNN.",1
"This preliminary report addresses the expressive power of unit resolution regarding input data encoded with partial truth assignments of propositional variables. A characterization of the functions that are computable in this way, which we propose to call propagatable functions, is given. By establishing that propagatable functions can also be computed using monotone circuits, we show that there exist polynomial time complexity propagable functions requiring an exponential amount of clauses to be computed using unit resolution. These results shed new light on studying CNF encodings of NP-complete problems in order to solve them using propositional satisfiability algorithms.",0
"The paper introduces a generalization for known probabilistic models such as log-linear and graphical models, called here multiplicative models. These models, that express probabilities via product of parameters are shown to capture multiple forms of contextual independence between variables, including decision graphs and noisy-OR functions. An inference algorithm for multiplicative models is provided and its correctness is proved. The complexity analysis of the inference algorithm uses a more refined parameter than the tree-width of the underlying graph, and shows the computational cost does not exceed that of the variable elimination algorithm in graphical models. The paper ends with examples where using the new models and algorithm is computationally beneficial.",0
"A central question for knowledge representation is how to encode and handle uncertain knowledge adequately. We introduce the probabilistic description logic ALCP that is designed for representing context-dependent knowledge, where the actual context taking place is uncertain. ALCP allows the expression of logical dependencies on the domain and probabilistic dependencies on the possible contexts. In order to draw probabilistic conclusions, we employ the principle of maximum entropy. We provide reasoning algorithms for this logic, and show that it satisfies several desirable properties of probabilistic logics.",0
"The advent of artificial intelligence has changed many disciplines such as engineering, social science and economics. Artificial intelligence is a computational technique which is inspired by natural intelligence such as the swarming of birds, the working of the brain and the pathfinding of the ants. These techniques have impact on economic theories. This book studies the impact of artificial intelligence on economic theories, a subject that has not been extensively studied. The theories that are considered are: demand and supply, asymmetrical information, pricing, rational choice, rational expectation, game theory, efficient market hypotheses, mechanism design, prospect, bounded rationality, portfolio theory, rational counterfactual and causality. The benefit of this book is that it evaluates existing theories of economics and update them based on the developments in artificial intelligence field.",0
"Natural language inference (NLI) is a fundamentally important task in natural language processing that has many applications. The recently released Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus has made it possible to develop and evaluate learning-centered methods such as deep neural networks for the NLI task. In this paper, we propose a special long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for NLI. Our model builds on top of a recently proposed neutral attention model for NLI but is based on a significantly different idea. Instead of deriving sentence embeddings for the premise and the hypothesis to be used for classification, our solution uses a matching-LSTM that performs word-by-word matching of the hypothesis with the premise. This LSTM is able to place more emphasis on important word-level matching results. In particular, we observe that this LSTM remembers important mismatches that are critical for predicting the contradiction or the neutral relationship label. Our experiments on the SNLI corpus show that our model outperforms the state of the art, achieving an accuracy of 86.1% on the test data.",1
"Machine Learning (ML) has found it particularly useful in malware detection. However, as the malware evolves very fast, the stability of the feature extracted from malware serves as a critical issue in malware detection. The recent success of deep learning in image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation indicates a potential solution for stabilizing the malware detection effectiveness. In this research, we haven't extract selected any features (e.g., the control-flow of op-code, classes, methods of functions and the timing they are invoked etc.) from Android apps. We develop our own method for translating Android apps into rgb color code and transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. After that, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, reducing the expert's intervention. Deep learning usually involves a large number of parameters that cannot be learned from only a small dataset. In this way, we currently have collected 1500k Android apps samples, have run our system over these 800k malware samples (benign and malicious samples are roughly equal-sized), and also through our back-end (60 million monthly active users and 10k new malware samples per day), we can effectively detect the malware. We believe that our methodology and the corresponding use of deep learning malware classification can overcome the weakness, and computational cost of the common static/dynamic analysis process or machine learning-based of Android malware detection approach.",0
"The rapid growth and diversity in service offerings and the ensuing complexity of information technology ecosystems present numerous management challenges (both operational and strategic). Instrumentation and measurement technology is, by and large, keeping pace with this development and growth. However, the algorithms, tools, and technology required to transform the data into relevant information for decision making are not. The claim in this paper (and the invited talk) is that the line of research conducted in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence is very well suited to address the challenges and close this gap. I will support this claim and discuss open problems using recent examples in diagnosis, model discovery, and policy optimization on three real life distributed systems.",0
"While game theory is widely used to model strategic interactions, a natural question is where do the game representations come from? One answer is to learn the representations from data. If one wants to learn both the payoffs and the players' strategies, a naive approach is to learn them both directly from the data. This approach ignores the fact the players might be playing reasonably good strategies, so there is a connection between the strategies and the data. The main contribution of this paper is to make this connection while learning. We formulate the learning problem as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem, including constraints both for the fit of the payoffs and strategies to the data and the fit of the strategies to the payoffs. We use quantal response equilibrium as our notion of rationality for quantifying the latter fit. Our results show that incorporating rationality constraints can improve learning when the amount of data is limited.",0

"When human agents come together to make decisions it is often the case that one human agent has more information than the other and this phenomenon is called information asymmetry and this distorts the market. Often if one human agent intends to manipulate a decision in its favor the human agent can signal wrong or right information. Alternatively, one human agent can screen for information to reduce the impact of asymmetric information on decisions. With the advent of artificial intelligence, signaling and screening have been made easier. This chapter studies the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric information. It is surmised that artificial intelligent agents reduce the degree of information asymmetry and thus the market where these agents are deployed become more efficient. It is also postulated that the more artificial intelligent agents there are deployed in the market the less is the volume of trades in the market. This is because for trade to happen the asymmetry of information on goods and services to be traded should exist.",0
"Similarity networks are important abstractions in many information management applications such as recommender systems, corpora analysis, and medical informatics. For instance, by inducing similarity networks between movies rated similarly by users, or between documents containing common terms, and or between clinical trials involving the same themes, we can aim to find the global structure of connectivities underlying the data, and use the network as a basis to make connections between seemingly disparate entities. In the above applications, composing similarities between objects of interest finds uses in serendipitous recommendation, in storytelling, and in clinical diagnosis, respectively. We present an algorithmic framework for traversing similarity paths using the notion of `hammock' paths which are generalization of traditional paths. Our framework is exploratory in nature so that, given starting and ending objects of interest, it explores candidate objects for path following, and heuristics to admissibly estimate the potential for paths to lead to a desired destination. We present three diverse applications: exploring movie similarities in the Netflix dataset, exploring abstract similarities across the PubMed corpus, and exploring description similarities in a database of clinical trials. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our approach for unstructured knowledge discovery in similarity networks.",0
"The thyroid, an endocrine gland that secretes hormones in the blood, circulates its products to all tissues of the body, where they control vital functions in every cell. Normal levels of thyroid hormone help the brain, heart, intestines, muscles and reproductive system function normally. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of the body. Abnormalities of thyroid function are usually related to production of too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or production of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). Therefore, the correct diagnosis of these diseases is very important topic. In this study, Linguistic Hedges Neural-Fuzzy Classifier with Selected Features (LHNFCSF) is presented for diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The performance evaluation of this system is estimated by using classification accuracy and k-fold cross-validation. The results indicated that the classification accuracy without feature selection was 98.6047% and 97.6744% during training and testing phases, respectively with RMSE of 0.02335. After applying feature selection algorithm, LHNFCSF achieved 100% for all cluster sizes during training phase. However, in the testing phase LHNFCSF achieved 88.3721% using one cluster for each class, 90.6977% using two clusters, 91.8605% using three clusters and 97.6744% using four clusters for each class and 12 fuzzy rules. The obtained classification accuracy was very promising with regard to the other classification applications in literature for this problem.",0
"Smile is an irrefutable expression that shows the physical state of the mind in both true and deceptive ways. Generally, it shows happy state of the mind, however, `smiles' can be deceptive, for example people can give a smile when they feel happy and sometimes they might also give a smile (in a different way) when they feel pity for others. This work aims to distinguish spontaneous (felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting and analyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes in the facial expression features through both tracking a series of facial fiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes and lips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automatically classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.",0
"This paper presents the design and development of a proposed rule based Decision Support System that will help students in selecting the best suitable faculty/major decision while taking admission in Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan. The basic idea of our approach is to design a model for testing and measuring the student capabilities like intelligence, understanding, comprehension, mathematical concepts plus his/her past academic record plus his/her intelligence level, and applying the module results to a rule-based decision support system to determine the compatibility of those capabilities with the available faculties/majors in Gomal University. The result is shown as a list of suggested faculties/majors with the student capabilities and abilities.",0
"The 7th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI'17, co-chaired by Sven Koenig and Eric Eaton) launched the EAAI New and Future AI Educator Program to support the training of early-career university faculty, secondary school faculty, and future educators (PhD candidates or postdocs who intend a career in academia). As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following ""blue sky"" questions:",0
"As robots enter human environments, they will be expected to accomplish a tremendous range of tasks. It is not feasible for robot designers to pre-program these behaviors or know them in advance, so one way to address this is through end-user programming, such as via learning from demonstration (LfD). While significant work has been done on the mechanics of enabling robot learning from human teachers, one unexplored aspect is enabling mutual feedback between both the human teacher and robot during the learning process, i.e., implicit learning. In this paper, we explore one aspect of this mutual understanding, grounding sequences, where both a human and robot provide non-verbal feedback to signify their mutual understanding during interaction. We conducted a study where people taught an autonomous humanoid robot a dance, and performed gesture analysis to measure people's responses to the robot during correct and incorrect demonstrations.",0
"Successive elimination of candidates is often a route to making manipulation intractable to compute. We prove that eliminating candidates does not necessarily increase the computational complexity of manipulation. However, for many voting rules used in practice, the computational complexity increases. For example, it is already known that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of single transferable voting (the elimination version of plurality voting). We show here that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of the elimination version of veto voting, of the closely related Coombs' rule, and of the elimination versions of a general class of scoring rules.",1
"Arising from many applications at the intersection of decision making and machine learning, Marginal Maximum A Posteriori (Marginal MAP) Problems unify the two main classes of inference, namely maximization (optimization) and marginal inference (counting), and are believed to have higher complexity than both of them. We propose XOR_MMAP, a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAP Problem, which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries to NP oracles, subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides a constant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP Problem, by encoding it as a single optimization in polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate our approach in several machine learning and decision making applications, and show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.",1
"Choquet expected utility (CEU) is one of the most sophisticated decision criteria used in decision theory under uncertainty. It provides a generalisation of expected utility enhancing both descriptive and prescriptive possibilities. In this paper, we investigate the use of CEU for path-planning under uncertainty with a special focus on robust solutions. We first recall the main features of the CEU model and introduce some examples showing its descriptive potential. Then we focus on the search for Choquet-optimal paths in multivalued implicit graphs where costs depend on different scenarios. After discussing complexity issues, we propose two different heuristic search algorithms to solve the problem. Finally, numerical experiments are reported, showing the practical efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",0
"In this paper, a progressive learning technique for multi-class classification is proposed. This newly developed learning technique is independent of the number of class constraints and it can learn new classes while still retaining the knowledge of previous classes. Whenever a new class (non-native to the knowledge learnt thus far) is encountered, the neural network structure gets remodeled automatically by facilitating new neurons and interconnections, and the parameters are calculated in such a way that it retains the knowledge learnt thus far. This technique is suitable for real-world applications where the number of classes is often unknown and online learning from real-time data is required. The consistency and the complexity of the progressive learning technique are analyzed. Several standard datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the developed technique. A comparative study shows that the developed technique is superior.",0
"Nowadays, hospitals are ubiquitous and integral to modern society. Patients flow in and out of a veritable whirlwind of paperwork, consultations, and potential inpatient admissions, through an abstracted system that is not without flaws. One of the biggest flaws in the medical system is perhaps an unexpected one: the patient alarm system. One longitudinal study reported an 88.8% rate of false alarms, with other studies reporting numbers of similar magnitudes. These false alarm rates lead to a number of deleterious effects that manifest in a significantly lower standard of care across clinics.",0
"A system with artificial intelligence usually relies on symbol manipulation, at least partly and implicitly. However, the interpretation of the symbols - what they represent and what they are about - is ultimately left to humans, as designers and users of the system. How symbols can acquire meaning for the system itself, independent of external interpretation, is an unsolved problem. Some grounding of symbols can be obtained by embodiment, that is, by causally connecting symbols (or sub-symbolic variables) to the physical environment, such as in a robot with sensors and effectors. However, a causal connection as such does not produce representation and aboutness of the kind that symbols have for humans. Here I present a theory that explains how humans and other living organisms have acquired the capability to have symbols and sub-symbolic variables that represent, refer to, and are about something else. The theory shows how reference can be to physical objects, but also to abstract objects, and even how it can be misguided (errors in reference) or be about non-existing objects. I subsequently abstract the primary components of the theory from their biological context, and discuss how and under what conditions the theory could be implemented in artificial agents. A major component of the theory is the strong nonlinearity associated with (potentially unlimited) self-reproduction. The latter is likely not acceptable in artificial systems. It remains unclear if goals other than those inherently serving self-reproduction can have aboutness and if such goals could be stabilized.",0
"There has been significant interest in crowdsourcing and human computation. One subclass of human computation applications are those directed at tasks that involve planning (e.g. travel planning) and scheduling (e.g. conference scheduling). Much of this work appears outside the traditional automated planning forums, and at the outset it is not clear whether automated planning has much of a role to play in these human computation systems. Interestingly however, work on these systems shows that even primitive forms of automated oversight of the human planner does help in significantly improving the effectiveness of the humans/crowd. In this paper, we will argue that the automated oversight used in these systems can be viewed as a primitive automated planner, and that there are several opportunities for more sophisticated automated planning in effectively steering crowdsourced planning. Straightforward adaptation of current planning technology is however hampered by the mismatch between the capabilities of human workers and automated planners. We identify two important challenges that need to be overcome before such adaptation of planning technology can occur: (i) interpreting the inputs of the human workers (and the requester) and (ii) steering or critiquing the plans being produced by the human workers armed only with incomplete domain and preference models. In this paper, we discuss approaches for handling these challenges, and characterize existing human computation systems in terms of the specific choices they make in handling these challenges.",0
"Computational Intelligence techniques are today widely used to solve complex engineering problems. Bio-inspired algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Inference Systems are nowadays adopted as hybrids techniques in the commercial and industrial environment. In this paper, we present an interesting application of the FUZZY-GA paradigm to Smart Grids. In particular, this study focuses on the possibility of tuning a Fuzzy Rule Base trying to discover, by means of a GA, a minimal fuzzy rules set in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) adopted to perform decision making for the power flow management task in a microgrid. The RB optimization is obtained through Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm, based on an encoding scheme inspired by Nature, applied to the optimization of the FIS parameters. Tests show how the proposed controller scheme is effective in maximizing the economic return when dealing with the problem of power flows management in a microgrid, equipped with an energy storage system.",0
"Intractable distributions present a common difficulty in inference within the probabilistic knowledge representation framework and variational methods have recently been popular in providing an approximate solution. In this article, we describe a perturbational approach in the form of a cumulant expansion which, to lowest order, recovers the standard Kullback-Leibler variational bound. Higher-order terms describe corrections on the variational approach without incurring much further computational cost. The relationship to other perturbational approaches such as TAP is also elucidated. We demonstrate the method on a particular class of undirected graphical models, Boltzmann machines, for which our simulation results confirm improved accuracy and enhanced stability during learning.",0
"A very computationally-efficient Monte-Carlo algorithm for the calculation of Dempster-Shafer belief is described. If Bel is the combination using Dempster's Rule of belief functions Bel, ..., Bel,7, then, for subset b of the frame C), Bel(b) can be calculated in time linear in 1(31 and m (given that the weight of conflict is bounded). The algorithm can also be used to improve the complexity of the Shenoy-Shafer algorithms on Markov trees, and be generalised to calculate Dempster-Shafer Belief over other logics.",0
"A true lie is a lie that becomes true when announced. In a logic of announcements, where the announcing agent is not modelled, a true lie is a formula (that is false and) that becomes true when announced. We investigate true lies and other types of interaction between announced formulas, their preconditions and their postconditions, in the setting Gerbrandy's logic of believed announcements, wherein agents may have or obtain incorrect beliefs. Our results are on the satisfiability and validity of instantiations of these semantically defined categories, on iterated announcements, including arbitrarily often iterated announcements, and on syntactic characterization. We close with results for iterated announcements in the logic of knowledge (instead of belief), and for lying as private announcements (instead of public announcements) to different agents. Detailed examples illustrate our lying concepts.",0
"We train a number of neural networks to play games Bowling, Breakout and Seaquest using information stored in the memory of a video game console Atari 2600. We consider four models of neural networks which differ in size and architecture: two networks which use only information contained in the RAM and two mixed networks which use both information in the RAM and information from the screen. As the benchmark we used the convolutional model proposed in NIPS and received comparable results in all considered games. Quite surprisingly, in the case of Seaquest we were able to train RAM-only agents which behave better than the benchmark screen-only agent. Mixing screen and RAM did not lead to an improved performance comparing to screen-only and RAM-only agents.",0
"We present two algorithms for exact and approximate inference in causal networks. The first algorithm, dynamic conditioning, is a refinement of cutset conditioning that has linear complexity on some networks for which cutset conditioning is exponential. The second algorithm, B-conditioning, is an algorithm for approximate inference that allows one to trade-off the quality of approximations with the computation time. We also present some experimental results illustrating the properties of the proposed algorithms.",0
"Current state of the art in the field of UAV activation relies solely on human operators for the design and adaptation of the drones' flying routes. Furthermore, this is being done today on an individual level (one vehicle per operators), with some exceptions of a handful of new systems, that are comprised of a small number of self-organizing swarms, manually guided by a human operator.",0
"We analyze and evaluate an online gradient descent algorithm with adaptive per-coordinate adjustment of learning rates. Our algorithm can be thought of as an online version of batch gradient descent with a diagonal preconditioner. This approach leads to regret bounds that are stronger than those of standard online gradient descent for general online convex optimization problems. Experimentally, we show that our algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for large scale machine learning problems.",0
"Modern conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) Boolean SAT solvers provide efficient automatic analysis of real-world feature models (FM) of systems ranging from cars to operating systems. It is well-known that solver-based analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known non-backtracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core, are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further strengthening our conclusions.",0
"We describe how to use propositional model counting for a quantitative analysis of product configuration data. Our approach computes valuable meta information such as the total number of valid configurations or the relative frequency of components. This information can be used to assess the severity of documentation errors or to measure documentation quality. As an application example we show how we apply these methods to product documentation formulas of the Mercedes-Benz line of vehicles. In order to process these large formulas we developed and implemented a new model counter for non-CNF formulas. Our model counter can process formulas, whose CNF representations could not be processed up till now.",0
"In computational cognitive science, the cognitive architecture ACT-R is very popular. It describes a model of cognition that is amenable to computer implementation, paving the way for computational psychology. Its underlying psychological theory has been investigated in many psychological experiments, but ACT-R lacks a formal definition of its underlying concepts from a mathematical-computational point of view. Although the canonical implementation of ACT-R is now modularized, this production rule system is still hard to adapt and extend in central components like the conflict resolution mechanism (which decides which of the applicable rules to apply next).",0
"Our understanding of intelligence is primarily directed at the level of human beings. This paper will attempt to give a more unifying definition that can be applied to everything that we know of. The definition would be used more to verify intelligence, where a scale would also be required to measure how much. A version of an accepted result of AI is then put forward as the acid test for Artificial Intelligence itself. Recent work has been more from a direction of mechanical processes, where this paper will not try to refute the idea of intelligence, but only to put it in a more general context.",0
"Many AI applications rely on knowledge encoded in a locigal knowledge base (KB). The most essential benefit of such logical KBs is the opportunity to perform automatic reasoning which however requires a KB to meet some minimal quality criteria such as consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the task of resolving such violated quality criteria in a KB can be extremely hard, especially when the problematic KB is large and complex. To this end, interactive KB debuggers have been introduced which ask a user queries whether certain statements must or must not hold in the intended domain. The given answers help to gradually restrict the search space for KB repairs.",0
"The Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem is a prominent NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of great importance in both theory and application. Local search has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is time-consuming. Secondly, although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues, we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as NuMVC. We conduct extensive experimental studies on the standard benchmarks, namely DIMACS and BHOSLIB. The experiment comparing NuMVC with state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms show that NuMVC is at least competitive with the nearest competitor namely PLS on the DIMACS benchmark, and clearly dominates all competitors on the BHOSLIB benchmark. Also, experimental results indicate that NuMVC finds an optimal solution much faster than the current best exact algorithm for Maximum Clique on random instances as well as some structured ones. Moreover, we study the effectiveness of the two strategies and the run-time behaviour through experimental analysis.",0
"To understand a node's centrality in a multiplex network, its centrality values in all the layers of the network can be aggregated. This requires a normalization of the values, to allow their meaningful comparison and aggregation over networks with different sizes and orders. The concrete choices of such preprocessing steps like normalization and aggregation are almost never discussed in network analytic papers. In this paper, we show that even sticking to the most simple centrality index (the degree) but using different, classic choices of normalization and aggregation strategies, can turn a node from being among the most central to being among the least central. We present our results by using an aggregation operator which scales between different, classic aggregation strategies based on three multiplex networks. We also introduce a new visualization and characterization of a node's sensitivity to the choice of a normalization and aggregation strategy in multiplex networks. The observed high sensitivity of single nodes to the specific choice of aggregation and normalization strategies is of strong importance, especially for all kinds of intelligence-analytic software as it questions the interpretations of the findings.",0
"There is currently a growing interest in techniques for hiding parts of the signature of an ontology Kh that is being reused by another ontology Kv. Towards this goal, in this paper we propose the import-by-query framework, which makes the content of Kh accessible through a limited query interface. If Kv reuses the symbols from Kh in a certain restricted way, one can reason over Kv U Kh by accessing only Kv and the query interface. We map out the landscape of the import-by-query problem. In particular, we outline the limitations of our framework and prove that certain restrictions on the expressivity of Kh and the way in which Kv reuses symbols from Kh are strictly necessary to enable reasoning in our setting. We also identify cases in which reasoning is possible and we present suitable import-by-query reasoning algorithms.",0
"Informledge System (ILS) is a knowledge network with autonomous nodes and intelligent links that integrate and structure the pieces of knowledge. In this paper, we aim to put forward the link dynamics involved in intelligent processing of information in ILS. There has been advancement in knowledge management field which involve managing information in databases from a single domain. ILS works with information from multiple domains stored in distributed way in the autonomous nodes termed as Knowledge Network Node (KNN). Along with the concept under consideration, KNNs store the processed information linking concepts and processors leading to the appropriate processing of information.",0
"We propose a generalization of SimRank similarity measure for heterogeneous information networks.

"This work proposes a unified heuristic algorithm for a large class of earliness-tardiness (E-T) scheduling problems. We consider single/parallel machine E-T problems that may or may not consider some additional features such as idle time, setup times and release dates. In addition, we also consider those problems whose objective is to minimize either the total (average) weighted completion time or the total (average) weighted flow time, which arise as particular cases when the due dates of all jobs are either set to zero or to their associated release dates, respectively. The developed local search based metaheuristic framework is quite simple, but at the same time relies on sophisticated procedures for efficiently performing local search according to the characteristics of the problem. We present efficient move evaluation approaches for some parallel machine problems that generalize the existing ones for single machine problems. The algorithm was tested in hundreds of instances of several E-T problems and particular cases. The results obtained show that our unified heuristic is capable of producing high quality solutions when compared to the best ones available in the literature that were obtained by specific methods. Moreover, we provide an extensive annotated bibliography on the problems related to those considered in this work, where we not only indicate the approach(es) used in each publication, but we also point out the characteristics of the problem(s) considered. Beyond that, we classify the existing methods in different categories so as to have a better idea of the popularity of each type of solution procedure.",0
"In this work, we propose an abductive framework for biosignal interpretation, based on the concept of Temporal Abstraction Patterns. A temporal abstraction pattern defines an abstraction relation between an observation hypothesis and a set of observations constituting its evidence support. New observations are generated abductively from any subset of the evidence of a pattern, building an abstraction hierarchy of observations in which higher levels contain those observations with greater interpretative value of the physiological processes underlying a given signal. Non-monotonic reasoning techniques have been applied to this model in order to find the best interpretation of a set of initial observations, permitting even to correct these observations by removing, adding or modifying them in order to make them consistent with the available domain knowledge. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted to apply this framework to a well known and bounded problem: the QRS detection on ECG signals. The objective is not to provide a new better QRS detector, but to test the validity of an abductive paradigm. These experiments show that a knowledge base comprising just a few very simple rhythm abstraction patterns can enhance the results of a state of the art algorithm by significantly improving its detection F1-score, besides proving the ability of the abductive framework to correct both sensitivity and specificity failures.",0
"Due to dynamic network conditions, routing is the most critical part in WMNs and needs to be optimised. The routing strategies developed for WMNs must be efficient to make it an operationally self configurable network. Thus we need to resort to near shortest path evaluation. This lays down the requirement of some soft computing approaches such that a near shortest path is available in an affordable computing time. This paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic based integrated cost measure in terms of delay, throughput and jitter. Based upon this distance (cost) between two adjacent nodes we evaluate minimal shortest path that updates routing tables. We apply two recent soft computing approaches namely Big Bang Big Crunch (BB-BC) and Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) approaches to enumerate shortest or near short paths. BB-BC theory is related with the evolution of the universe whereas BBO is inspired by dynamical equilibrium in the number of species on an island. Both the algorithms have low computational time and high convergence speed. Simulation results show that the proposed routing algorithms find the optimal shortest path taking into account three most important parameters of network dynamics. It has been further observed that for the shortest path problem BB-BC outperforms BBO in terms of speed and percent error between the evaluated minimal path and the actual shortest path.",0
"Short Message Service (SMS) based Information Systems (SMSbIS) provide an excellent alternative to a traditional approach of obtaining specific information by direct (through phone) or indirect (IVRS, Web, Email) probing. Information and communication technology and far reaching mobile penetration has opened this new research trend Number of key players in Search industry including Microsoft and Google are attracted by the expected increase in volume of use of such applications. The wide range of applications and their public acceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several applications such as SMS based information access using database management services, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS based information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have been emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these systems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and executed by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the objectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well structured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in different dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a chronological progress with respect to research and development in this upcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in this paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand the technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here would be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based Information System of any specific domain.",0
A new approach to data stream clustering with the help of an ensemble of adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems is proposed.

"Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is an established branch of Artificial Intelligence. The purpose of ATP is to design a system which can automatically figure out an algorithm either to prove or disprove a mathematical claim, on the basis of a set of given premises, using a set of fundamental postulates and following the method of logical inference. In this paper, we propose GraATP, a generalized framework for automated theorem proving in plane geometry. Our proposed method translates the geometric entities into nodes of a graph and the relations between them as edges of that graph. The automated system searches for different ways to reach the conclusion for a claim via graph traversal by which the validity of the geometric theorem is examined.",0
"In this work, we are interested in structure learning for a set of spatially distributed dynamical systems, where individual subsystems are coupled via latent variables and observed through a filter. We represent this model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that characterises the unidirectional coupling between subsystems. Standard approaches to structure learning are not applicable in this framework due to the hidden variables, however we can exploit the properties of certain dynamical systems to formulate exact methods based on state space reconstruction. We approach the problem by using reconstruction theorems to analytically derive a tractable expression for the KL-divergence of a candidate DAG from the observed dataset. We show this measure can be decomposed as a function of two information-theoretic measures, transfer entropy and stochastic interaction. We then present two mathematically robust scoring functions based on transfer entropy and statistical independence tests. These results support the previously held conjecture that transfer entropy can be used to infer effective connectivity in complex networks.",0
"PDDL+ planning has its semantics rooted in hybrid automata (HA) and recent work has shown that it can be modeled as a network of HAs.

"Traditional staging is based on a formal approach of similarity leaning on dramaturgical ontologies and instanciation variations.

"Although the problem of assigning a critique of robotic behavior in near-unanimous agreement to human norms seems intractable, a starting point of such a framework is of the collection of knowledge a priori and experience a posteriori categorized in a set of judgments available to the intelligence, translated into computer code. If such an intersection were successful, an algorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent equivalence to human cognition is established. The process of framework development itself reveals avenues of improvement and optimization. This paper will propose the application of Kant's critique of reason to current perceptions of autonomous intelligent systems.",0
"The IDP knowledge base system currently uses MiniSAT(ID) as its backend Constraint Programming (CP) solver. A few similar systems have used a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver as backend.

It describes the use of CPLEX as a backend for IDP and reports on experiments comparing both backends.",0
"This paper discusses in layperson's terms human and computational studies of the impact of threat and fear on exploration and creativity. A first study showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve. However, for the fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take longer. This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior varying only one parameter, the fear parameter. A second study showed that stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than stories inspired by non-threatening photographs. Various explanations for the findings are discussed.",0
"We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets. Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text. Understanding via empirical experimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages. The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets. The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch. Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German. In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data. Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models. The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.",0
"For building question answering systems and natural language interfaces, semantic parsing has emerged as an important and powerful paradigm. Semantic parsers map natural language into logical forms, the classic representation for many important linguistic phenomena. The modern twist is that we are interested in learning semantic parsers from data, which introduces a new layer of statistical and computational issues. This article lays out the components of a statistical semantic parser, highlighting the key challenges. We will see that semantic parsing is a rich fusion of the logical and the statistical world, and that this fusion will play an integral role in the future of natural language understanding systems.",0
"This paper presents a method to compute automatically topological relations using SWRL rules. The calculation of these rules is based on the definition of a Selective Nef Complexes Nef Polyhedra structure generated from standard Polyhedron. The Selective Nef Complexes is a data model providing a set of binary Boolean operators such as Union, Difference, Intersection and Symmetric difference, and unary operators such as Interior, Closure and Boundary. In this work, these operators are used to compute topological relations between objects defined by the constraints of the 9 Intersection Model (9-IM) from Egenhofer. With the help of these constraints, we defined a procedure to compute the topological relations on Nef polyhedra. These topological relationships are Disjoint, Meets, Contains, Inside, Covers, CoveredBy, Equals and Overlaps, and defined in a top-level ontology with a specific semantic definition on relation such as Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Functional, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. The results of the computation of topological relationships are stored in an OWL-DL ontology allowing after what to infer on these new relationships between objects. In addition, logic rules based on the Semantic Web Rule Language allows the definition of logic programs that define which topological relationships have to be computed on which kind of objects with specific attributes. For instance, a ""Building"" that overlaps a ""Railway"" is a ""RailStation"".",0
"We describe the semantic foundations for elicitation of generalized additively independent (GAI) utilities using the minimax regret criterion, and propose several new query types and strategies for this purpose. Computational feasibility is obtained by exploiting the local GAI structure in the model. Our results provide a practical approach for implementing preference-based constrained configuration optimization as well as effective search in multiattribute product databases.",0
"Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) via rank minimization is a powerful tool for recovering underlying low-rank structure of clean data corrupted with sparse noise/outliers. In many low-level vision problems, not only it is known that the underlying structure of clean data is low-rank, but the exact rank of clean data is also known. Yet, when applying conventional rank minimization for those problems, the objective function is formulated in a way that does not fully utilize a priori target rank information about the problems. This observation motivates us to investigate whether there is a better alternative solution when using rank minimization. In this paper, instead of minimizing the nuclear norm, we propose to minimize the partial sum of singular values, which implicitly encourages the target rank constraint in rank minimization. Our experimental analyses show that, when the number of samples is deficient, our approach leads to a higher success rate than conventional rank minimization, while the solutions obtained by the two approaches are almost identical when the number of samples is more than sufficient. We apply our approach to various low-level vision problems, e.g. high dynamic range imaging, motion edge detection, photometric stereo, image alignment and recovery, and show that our results outperform those obtained by the conventional nuclear norm rank minimization method.",0
"We introduce an extension of the n-ary description logic DLR to deal with attribute-labelled tuples (generalising the positional notation), with arbitrary projections of relations (inclusion dependencies), generic functional dependencies and with global and local objectification (reifying relations or their projections). We show how a simple syntactic condition on the appearance of projections and functional dependencies in a knowledge base makes the language decidable without increasing the computational complexity of the basic DLR language.",0
Influence diagrams are a decision-theoretic extension of probabilistic graphical models. In this paper we show how they can be used to solve the Goddard problem. We present results of numerical experiments with this problem and compare the solutions provided by influence diagrams with the optimal solution.,0
"It is common to view programs as a combination of logic and control: the logic part defines what the program must do, the control part -- how to do it. The Logic Programming paradigm was developed with the intention of separating the logic from the control. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on automatic generation of control for logic programs. Only a few of these works considered the issue of automatic generation of control for improving the efficiency of logic programs. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for automatic finding of lowest-cost subgoal orderings. The algorithm works using the divide-and-conquer strategy. The given set of subgoals is partitioned into smaller sets, based on co-occurrence of free variables. The subsets are ordered recursively and merged, yielding a provably optimal order. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of the algorithm by testing it in several domains, and discuss the possibilities of its cooperation with other existing methods.",0
"In this paper, an improved multimodal optimization (MMO) algorithm,called LSEPSO,has been proposed. LSEPSO combined Electrostatic Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) algorithm and a local search method and then made some modification on them. It has been shown to improve global and local optima finding ability of the algorithm. This algorithm useda modified local search to improve particle's personal best, which used n-nearest-neighbour instead of nearest-neighbour. Then, by creating n new points among each particle and n nearest particles, it tried to find a point which could be the alternative of particle's personal best. This method prevented particle's attenuation and following a specific particle by its neighbours. The performed tests on a number of benchmark functions clearly demonstrated that the improved algorithm is able to solve MMO problems and outperform other tested algorithms in this article.",0
"We can perform inference in Bayesian belief networks by enumerating instantiations with high probability thus approximating the marginals. In this paper, we present a method for determining the fraction of instantiations that has to be considered such that the absolute error in the marginals does not exceed a predefined value. The method is based on extreme value theory. Essentially, the proposed method uses the reversed generalized Pareto distribution to model probabilities of instantiations below a given threshold. Based on this distribution, an estimate of the maximal absolute error if instantiations with probability smaller than u are disregarded can be made.",0
"The web plays an important role in people's social lives since the emergence of Web 2.0. It facilitates the interaction between users, gives them the possibility to freely interact, share and collaborate through social networks, online communities forums, blogs, wikis and other online collaborative media. However, an other side of the web is negatively taken such as posting inflammatory messages. Thus, when dealing with the online communities forums, the managers seek to always enhance the performance of such platforms. In fact, to keep the serenity and prohibit the disturbance of the normal atmosphere, managers always try to novice users against these malicious persons by posting such message (DO NOT FEED TROLLS). But, this kind of warning is not enough to reduce this phenomenon. In this context we propose a new approach for detecting malicious people also called 'Trolls' in order to allow community managers to take their ability to post online. To be more realistic, our proposal is defined within an uncertain framework. Based on the assumption consisting on the trolls' integration in the successful discussion threads, we try to detect the presence of such malicious users. Indeed, this method is based on a conflict measure of the belief function theory applied between the different messages of the thread. In order to show the feasibility and the result of our approach, we test it in different simulated data.",0
"Dynamic programming algorithms have been successfully applied to propositional stochastic planning problems by using compact representations, in particular algebraic decision diagrams, to capture domain dynamics and value functions. Work on symbolic dynamic programming lifted these ideas to first order logic using several representation schemes. Recent work introduced a first order variant of decision diagrams (FODD) and developed a value iteration algorithm for this representation. This paper develops several improvements to the FODD algorithm that make the approach practical. These include, new reduction operators that decrease the size of the representation, several speedup techniques, and techniques for value approximation. Incorporating these, the paper presents a planning system, FODD-Planner, for solving relational stochastic planning problems. The system is evaluated on several domains, including problems from the recent international planning competition, and shows competitive performance with top ranking systems. This is the first demonstration of feasibility of this approach and it shows that abstraction through compact representation is a promising approach to stochastic planning.",0
"This paper considers an optimal task allocation problem for human robot collaboration in human robot systems with persistent tasks. Such human robot systems consist of human operators and intelligent robots collaborating with each other to accomplish complex tasks that cannot be done by either part alone. The system objective is to maximize the probability of successfully executing persistent tasks that are formulated as linear temporal logic specifications and minimize the average cost between consecutive visits of a particular proposition. This paper proposes to model the human robot collaboration under a framework with the composition of multiple Markov Decision Process (MDP) with possibly unknown transition probabilities, which characterizes how human cognitive states, such as human trust and fatigue, stochastically change with the robot performance. Under the unknown MDP models, an algorithm is developed to learn the model and obtain an optimal task allocation policy that minimizes the expected average cost for each task cycle and maximizes the probability of satisfying linear temporal logic constraints. Moreover, this paper shows that the difference between the optimal policy based on the learned model and that based on the underlying ground truth model can be bounded by arbitrarily small constant and large confidence level with sufficient samples. The case study of an assembly process demonstrates the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed learning based human robot collaboration.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel two-stage metric learning algorithm. We first map each learning instance to a probability distribution by computing its similarities to a set of fixed anchor points. Then, we define the distance in the input data space as the Fisher information distance on the associated statistical manifold. This induces in the input data space a new family of distance metric with unique properties. Unlike kernelized metric learning, we do not require the similarity measure to be positive semi-definite. Moreover, it can also be interpreted as a local metric learning algorithm with well defined distance approximation. We evaluate its performance on a number of datasets. It outperforms significantly other metric learning methods and SVM.",1
"Planning as satisfiability is a principal approach to planning with many eminent advantages. The existing planning as satisfiability techniques usually use encodings compiled from STRIPS. We introduce a novel SAT encoding scheme (SASE) based on the SAS+ formalism. The new scheme exploits the structural information in SAS+, resulting in an encoding that is both more compact and efficient for planning. We prove the correctness of the new encoding by establishing an isomorphism between the solution plans of SASE and that of STRIPS based encodings. We further analyze the transition variables newly introduced in SASE to explain why it accommodates modern SAT solving algorithms and improves performance. We give empirical statistical results to support our analysis. We also develop a number of techniques to further reduce the encoding size of SASE, and conduct experimental studies to show the strength of each individual technique. Finally, we report extensive experimental results to demonstrate significant improvements of SASE over the state-of-the-art STRIPS based encoding schemes in terms of both time and memory efficiency.",0
"The process of diagnosis involves learning about the state of a system from various observations of symptoms or findings about the system. Sophisticated Bayesian (and other) algorithms have been developed to revise and maintain beliefs about the system as observations are made. Nonetheless, diagnostic models have tended to ignore some common sense reasoning exploited by human diagnosticians; In particular, one can learn from which observations have not been made, in the spirit of conversational implicature. There are two concepts that we describe to extract information from the observations not made. First, some symptoms, if present, are more likely to be reported before others. Second, most human diagnosticians and expert systems are economical in their data-gathering, searching first where they are more likely to find symptoms present. Thus, there is a desirable bias toward reporting symptoms that are present. We develop a simple model for these concepts that can significantly improve diagnostic inference.",0
"In this paper we continue the work on our extension of Answer Set Programming by non-Herbrand functions and add to the language support for arithmetic expressions and various inequality relations over non-Herbrand functions, as well as consistency-restoring rules from CR-Prolog. We demonstrate the use of this latest version of the language in the representation of important kinds of knowledge.",0
"General Video Game Artificial Intelligence is a general game playing framework for Artificial General Intelligence research in the video-games domain. In this paper, we propose for the first time a screen capture learning agent for General Video Game AI framework. A Deep Q-Network algorithm was applied and improved to develop an agent capable of learning to play different games in the framework. After testing this algorithm using various games of different categories and difficulty levels, the results suggest that our proposed screen capture learning agent has the potential to learn many different games using only a single learning algorithm.",0
"A long-lived autonomous agent should be able to respond online to novel instances of tasks from a familiar domain. Acting online requires 'fast' responses, in terms of rapid convergence, especially when the task instance has a short duration, such as in applications involving interactions with humans. These requirements can be problematic for many established methods for learning to act. In domains where the agent knows that the task instance is drawn from a family of related tasks, albeit without access to the label of any given instance, it can choose to act through a process of policy reuse from a library, rather than policy learning from scratch. In policy reuse, the agent has prior knowledge of the class of tasks in the form of a library of policies that were learnt from sample task instances during an offline training phase. We formalise the problem of policy reuse, and present an algorithm for efficiently responding to a novel task instance by reusing a policy from the library of existing policies, where the choice is based on observed 'signals' which correlate to policy performance. We achieve this by posing the problem as a Bayesian choice problem with a corresponding notion of an optimal response, but the computation of that response is in many cases intractable. Therefore, to reduce the computation cost of the posterior, we follow a Bayesian optimisation approach and define a set of policy selection functions, which balance exploration in the policy library against exploitation of previously tried policies, together with a model of expected performance of the policy library on their corresponding task instances. We validate our method in several simulated domains of interactive, short-duration episodic tasks, showing rapid convergence in unknown task variations.",0
"Recent interests in dynamic decision modeling have led to the development of several representation and inference methods. These methods however, have limited application under time critical conditions where a trade-off between model quality and computational tractability is essential. This paper presents an approach to time-critical dynamic decision modeling. A knowledge representation and modeling method called the time-critical dynamic influence diagram is proposed. The formalism has two forms. The condensed form is used for modeling and model abstraction, while the deployed form which can be converted from the condensed form is used for inference purposes. The proposed approach has the ability to represent space-temporal abstraction within the model. A knowledge-based meta-reasoning approach is proposed for the purpose of selecting the best abstracted model that provide the optimal trade-off between model quality and model tractability. An outline of the knowledge-based model construction algorithm is also provided.",0
"The paper analyzes the interaction between humans and computers in terms of response time in solving the image-based CAPTCHA. In particular, the analysis focuses on the attitude of the different Internet users in easily solving four different types of image-based CAPTCHAs which include facial expressions like: animated character, old woman, surprised face, worried face. To pursue this goal, an experiment is realized involving 100 Internet users in solving the four types of CAPTCHAs, differentiated by age, Internet experience, and education level. The response times are collected for each user. Then, association rules are extracted from user data, for evaluating the dependence of the response time in solving the CAPTCHA from age, education level and experience in internet usage by statistical analysis. The results implicitly capture the users' psychological states showing in what states the users are more sensible. It reveals to be a novelty and a meaningful analysis in the state-of-the-art.",0
"We study a novel architecture and training procedure for locomotion tasks. A high-frequency, low-level ""spinal"" network with access to proprioceptive sensors learns sensorimotor primitives by training on simple tasks. This pre-trained module is fixed and connected to a low-frequency, high-level ""cortical"" network, with access to all sensors, which drives behavior by modulating the inputs to the spinal network. Where a monolithic end-to-end architecture fails completely, learning with a pre-trained spinal module succeeds at multiple high-level tasks, and enables the effective exploration required to learn from sparse rewards. We test our proposed architecture on three simulated bodies: a 16-dimensional swimming snake, a 20-dimensional quadruped, and a 54-dimensional humanoid. Our results are illustrated in the accompanying video at",0
"This article shows how the recent breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning (RL) that have enabled robots to learn to play arcade video games, walk or assemble colored bricks, can be used to perform other tasks that are currently at the core of engineering cyberphysical systems. We present the first use of RL for the control of systems modeled by discretized non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and devise a novel algorithm to use non-parametric control techniques for large multi-agent systems. We show how neural network based RL enables the control of discretized PDEs whose parameters are unknown, random, and time-varying. We introduce an algorithm of Mutual Weight Regularization (MWR) which alleviates the curse of dimensionality of multi-agent control schemes by sharing experience between agents while giving each agent the opportunity to specialize its action policy so as to tailor it to the local parameters of the part of the system it is located in.",0
"Ant colony system (ACS) is a promising approach which has been widely used in problems such as Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP), Job shop scheduling problems (JSP) and Quadratic Assignment problems (QAP). In its original implementation, parameters of the algorithm were selected by trial and error approach. Over the last few years, novel approaches have been proposed on adapting the parameters of ACS in improving its performance. The aim of this paper is to use a framework introduced for self-tuning optimization algorithms combined with the firefly algorithm (FA) to tune the parameters of the ACS solving symmetric TSP problems. The FA optimizes the problem specific parameters of ACS while the parameters of the FA are tuned by the selected framework itself. With this approach, the user neither has to work with the parameters of ACS nor the parameters of FA. Using common symmetric TSP problems we demonstrate that the framework fits well for the ACS. A detailed statistical analysis further verifies the goodness of the new ACS over the existing ACS and also of the other techniques used to tune the parameters of ACS.",0
"In this paper we investigate the links between instantiated argumentation systems and the axioms for non-monotonic reasoning described in [9] with the aim of characterising the nature of argument based reasoning. In doing so, we consider two possible interpretations of the consequence relation, and describe which axioms are met by ASPIC+ under each of these interpretations. We then consider the links between these axioms and the rationality postulates. Our results indicate that argument based reasoning as characterised by ASPIC+ is - according to the axioms of [9] - non-cumulative and non-monotonic, and therefore weaker than the weakest non-monotonic reasoning systems they considered possible. This weakness underpins ASPIC+'s success in modelling other reasoning systems, and we conclude by considering the relationship between ASPIC+ and other weak logical systems.",0
"Recent work introduced Generalized First Order Decision Diagrams (GFODD) as a knowledge representation that is useful in mechanizing decision theoretic planning in relational domains. GFODDs generalize function-free first order logic and include numerical values and numerical generalizations of existential and universal quantification. Previous work presented heuristic inference algorithms for GFODDs. In this paper, we study the complexity of the evaluation problem, the satisfiability problem, and the equivalence problem for GFODDs under the assumption that the size of the intended model is given with the problem, a restriction that guarantees decidability. Our results provide a complete characterization placing these problems within the polynomial hierarchy. The same characterization applies to the corresponding restriction of problems in first order logic, giving an interesting new avenue for efficient inference when the number of objects is bounded. Our results show that for $\Sigma_k$ formulas, and for corresponding GFODDs, evaluation and satisfiability are $\Sigma_k^p$ complete, and equivalence is $\Pi_{k+1}^p$ complete. For $\Pi_k$ formulas evaluation is $\Pi_k^p$ complete, satisfiability is one level higher and is $\Sigma_{k+1}^p$ complete, and equivalence is $\Pi_{k+1}^p$ complete.",1
"While the optimization problem behind deep neural networks is highly non-convex, it is frequently observed in practice that training deep networks seems possible without getting stuck in suboptimal points. It has been argued that this is the case as all local minima are close to being globally optimal. We show that this is (almost) true, in fact almost all local minima are globally optimal, for a fully connected network with squared loss and analytic activation function given that the number of hidden units of one layer of the network is larger than the number of training points and the network structure from this layer on is pyramidal.",1
"When securing complex infrastructures or large environments, constant surveillance of every area is not affordable. To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is common when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system which non-deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary graphs is APX-hard even in zero-sum games and we provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms. Furthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies, showing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be found in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in real-life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show that without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.",0
"Defining and modeling the relation of inclusion between continuous belief function may be considered as an important operation in order to study their behaviors. Within this paper we will propose and present two forms of inclusion: The strict and the partial one. In order to develop this relation, we will study the case of consonant belief function. To do so, we will simulate normal distributions allowing us to model and analyze these relations. Based on that, we will determine the parameters influencing and characterizing the two forms of inclusion.",0
"Approximate dynamic programming has been used successfully in a large variety of domains, but it relies on a small set of provided approximation features to calculate solutions reliably. Large and rich sets of features can cause existing algorithms to overfit because of a limited number of samples. We address this shortcoming using $L_1$ regularization in approximate linear programming. Because the proposed method can automatically select the appropriate richness of features, its performance does not degrade with an increasing number of features. These results rely on new and stronger sampling bounds for regularized approximate linear programs. We also propose a computationally efficient homotopy method. The empirical evaluation of the approach shows that the proposed method performs well on simple MDPs and standard benchmark problems.",1
"Laplace's method, a family of asymptotic methods used to approximate integrals, is presented as a potential candidate for the tool box of techniques used for knowledge acquisition and probabilistic inference in belief networks with continuous variables. This technique approximates posterior moments and marginal posterior distributions with reasonable accuracy [errors are O(n^-2) for posterior means] in many interesting cases. The method also seems promising for computing approximations for Bayes factors for use in the context of model selection, model uncertainty and mixtures of pdfs. The limitations, regularity conditions and computational difficulties for the implementation of Laplace's method are comparable to those associated with the methods of maximum likelihood and posterior mode analysis.",0
"Consequence-based calculi are a family of reasoning algorithms for description logics (DLs), and they combine hypertableau and resolution in a way that often achieves excellent performance in practice. Up to now, however, they were proposed for either Horn DLs (which do not support disjunction), or for DLs without counting quantifiers. In this paper we present a novel consequence-based calculus for SRIQ---a rich DL that supports both features. This extension is non-trivial since the intermediate consequences that need to be derived during reasoning cannot be captured using DLs themselves. The results of our preliminary performance evaluation suggest the feasibility of our approach in practice.",0
"A prototype tool to assist architects during the early design stage of floor plans has been developed, consisting of an Evolutionary Program for the Space Allocation Problem (EPSAP), which generates sets of floor plan alternatives according to the architect's preferences; and a Floor Plan Performance Optimization Program (FPOP), which optimizes the selected solutions according to thermal performance criteria. The design variables subject to optimization are window position and size, overhangs, fins, wall positioning, and building orientation. A procedure using a transformation operator with gradient descent, such as behavior, coupled with a dynamic simulation engine was developed for the thermal evaluation and optimization process. However, the need to evaluate all possible alternatives regarding designing variables being used during the optimization process leads to an intensive use of thermal simulation, which dramatically increases the simulation time, rendering it unpractical. An alternative approach is a smart optimization approach, which utilizes an oriented and adaptive search technique to efficiently find the near optimum solution. This paper presents the search methodology for the building orientation of floor plan designs, and the corresponding efficiency and effectiveness indicators. The calculations are based on 100 floor plan designs generated by EPSAP. All floor plans have the same design program, location, and weather data, changing only their geometry. Dynamic simulation of buildings was effectively used together with the optimization procedure in this approach to significantly improve the designs. The use of the orientation variable has been included in the algorithm.",0
"A compact information-rich representation of the environment, also called a feature abstraction, can simplify a robot's task of mapping its raw sensory inputs to useful action sequences. However, in environments that are non-stationary and only partially observable, a single abstraction is probably not sufficient to encode most variations. Therefore, learning multiple sets of spatially or temporally local, modular abstractions of the inputs would be beneficial. How can a robot learn these local abstractions without a teacher? More specifically, how can it decide from where and when to start learning a new abstraction? A recently proposed algorithm called Curious Dr. MISFA addresses this problem. The algorithm is based on two underlying learning principles called artificial curiosity and slowness. The former is used to make the robot self-motivated to explore by rewarding itself whenever it makes progress learning an abstraction; the later is used to update the abstraction by extracting slowly varying components from raw sensory inputs. Curious Dr. MISFA's application is, however, limited to discrete domains constrained by a pre-defined state space and has design limitations that make it unstable in certain situations. This paper presents a significant improvement that is applicable to continuous environments, is computationally less expensive, simpler to use with fewer hyper parameters, and stable in certain non-stationary environments. We demonstrate the efficacy and stability of our method in a vision-based robot simulator.",0
"We view the syntax-based approaches to default reasoning as a model-based diagnosis problem, where each source giving a piece of information is considered as a component. It is formalized in the ATMS framework (each source corresponds to an assumption). We assume then that all sources are independent and ""fail"" with a very small probability. This leads to a probability assignment on the set of candidates, or equivalently on the set of consistent environments. This probability assignment induces a Dempster-Shafer belief function which measures the probability that a proposition can be deduced from the evidence. This belief function can be used in several different ways to define a non-monotonic consequence relation. We study and compare these consequence relations. The -case of prioritized knowledge bases is briefly considered.",0
"Brain-Like Stochastic Search (BLiSS) refers to this task: given a family of utility functions U(u,A), where u is a vector of parameters or task descriptors, maximize or minimize U with respect to u, using networks (Option Nets) which input A and learn to generate good options u stochastically. This paper discusses why this is crucial to brain-like intelligence (an area funded by NSF) and to many applications, and discusses various possibilities for network design and training. The appendix discusses recent research, relations to work on stochastic optimization in operations research, and relations to engineering-based approaches to understanding neocortex.",0
"We present Confidence-Based Autonomy (CBA), an interactive algorithm for policy learning from demonstration. The CBA algorithm consists of two components which take advantage of the complimentary abilities of humans and computer agents. The first component, Confident Execution, enables the agent to identify states in which demonstration is required, to request a demonstration from the human teacher and to learn a policy based on the acquired data. The algorithm selects demonstrations based on a measure of action selection confidence, and our results show that using Confident Execution the agent requires fewer demonstrations to learn the policy than when demonstrations are selected by a human teacher. The second algorithmic component, Corrective Demonstration, enables the teacher to correct any mistakes made by the agent through additional demonstrations in order to improve the policy and future task performance. CBA and its individual components are compared and evaluated in a complex simulated driving domain. The complete CBA algorithm results in the best overall learning performance, successfully reproducing the behavior of the teacher while balancing the tradeoff between number of demonstrations and number of incorrect actions during learning.",0
"The specification of aMarkov decision process (MDP) can be difficult. Reward function specification is especially problematic; in practice, it is often cognitively complex and time-consuming for users to precisely specify rewards. This work casts the problem of specifying rewards as one of preference elicitation and aims to minimize the degree of precision with which a reward function must be specified while still allowing optimal or near-optimal policies to be produced. We first discuss how robust policies can be computed for MDPs given only partial reward information using the minimax regret criterion. We then demonstrate how regret can be reduced by efficiently eliciting reward information using bound queries, using regret-reduction as a means for choosing suitable queries. Empirical results demonstrate that regret-based reward elicitation offers an effective way to produce near-optimal policies without resorting to the precise specification of the entire reward function.",0
"Cooperative multi-agent systems can be naturally used to model many real world problems, such as network packet routing and the coordination of autonomous vehicles. There is a great need for new reinforcement learning methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the agents' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single agent's action, while keeping the other agents' actions fixed. COMA also uses a critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state.",0
"The parameters of temporal models, such as dynamic Bayesian networks, may be modelled in a Bayesian context as static or atemporal variables that influence transition probabilities at every time step. Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.",1
"In many statistical problems, a more coarse-grained model may be suitable for population-level behaviour, whereas a more detailed model is appropriate for accurate modelling of individual behaviour. This raises the question of how to integrate both types of models. Methods such as posterior regularization follow the idea of generalized moment matching, in that they allow matching expectations between two models, but sometimes both models are most conveniently expressed as latent variable models. We propose latent Bayesian melding, which is motivated by averaging the distributions over populations statistics of both the individual-level and the population-level models under a logarithmic opinion pool framework. In a case study on electricity disaggregation, which is a type of single-channel blind source separation problem, we show that latent Bayesian melding leads to significantly more accurate predictions than an approach based solely on generalized moment matching.",1
"This work proposes action networks as a semantically well-founded framework for reasoning about actions and change under uncertainty. Action networks add two primitives to probabilistic causal networks: controllable variables and persistent variables. Controllable variables allow the representation of actions as directly setting the value of specific events in the domain, subject to preconditions. Persistent variables provide a canonical model of persistence according to which both the state of a variable and the causal mechanism dictating its value persist over time unless intervened upon by an action (or its consequences). Action networks also allow different methods for quantifying the uncertainty in causal relationships, which go beyond traditional probabilistic quantification. This paper describes both recent results and work in progress.",0
"We present a new approach to dealing with default information based on the theory of belief functions. Our semantic structures, inspired by Adams' epsilon-semantics, are epsilon-belief assignments, where values committed to focal elements are either close to 0 or close to 1. We define two systems based on these structures, and relate them to other non-monotonic systems presented in the literature. We show that our second system correctly addresses the well-known problems of specificity, irrelevance, blocking of inheritance, ambiguity, and redundancy.",0
"In the last two decades, a number of methods have been proposed for forecasting based on fuzzy time series. Most of the fuzzy time series methods are presented for forecasting of car road accidents. However, the forecasting accuracy rates of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we compared our proposed new method of fuzzy time series forecasting with existing methods. Our method is based on means based partitioning of the historical data of car road accidents. The proposed method belongs to the kth order and time-variant methods. The proposed method can get the best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents than the existing methods.",0
"Path planning is one of the most vital elements of mobile robotics. With a priori knowledge of the environment, global path planning provides a collision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be calculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A* search method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that minimizes the path cost. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize the distance traversed from start to goal, yet many mobile robot applications call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem. Past studies have applied genetic algorithms to MOO path planning problems, but these may have the disadvantages of computational complexity and suboptimal solutions. Alternatively, the algorithm in this paper approaches MOO path planning with the use of Pareto fronts, or finding non-dominated solutions. The algorithm presented incorporates Pareto optimality into every step of A* search, thus it is named A*-PO. Results of simulations show A*-PO outperformed several variations of the standard A* algorithm for MOO path planning. A planetary exploration rover case study was added to demonstrate the viability of A*-PO in a real-world application.",0
"Approximate linear programming (ALP) is an efficient approach to solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs). The main idea of the method is to approximate the optimal value function by a set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming (LP). This paper proposes a new ALP approximation. Comparing to the standard ALP formulation, we decompose the constraint space into a set of low-dimensional spaces. This structure allows for solving the new LP efficiently. In particular, the constraints of the LP can be satisfied in a compact form without an exponential dependence on the treewidth of ALP constraints. We study both practical and theoretical aspects of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate its scale-up potential on an MDP with more than 2^100 states.",0
"Researchers in answer set programming and constraint programming have spent significant efforts in the development of hybrid languages and solving algorithms combining the strengths of these traditionally separate fields. These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set programming. Constraint answer set programming languages and systems proved to be successful at providing declarative, yet efficient solutions to problems involving hybrid reasoning tasks. One of the main contributions of this paper is the first comprehensive account of the constraint answer set language and solver EZCSP, a mainstream representative of this research area that has been used in various successful applications. We also develop an extension of the transition systems proposed by Nieuwenhuis et al. in 2006 to capture Boolean satisfiability solvers. We use this extension to describe the EZCSP algorithm and prove formal claims about it. The design and algorithmic details behind EZCSP clearly demonstrate that the development of the hybrid systems of this kind is challenging. Many questions arise when one faces various design choices in an attempt to maximize system's benefits. One of the key decisions that a developer of a hybrid solver makes is settling on a particular integration schema within its implementation. Thus, another important contribution of this paper is a thorough case study based on EZCSP, focused on the various integration schemas that it provides.",0
"The Team-maxmin equilibrium prescribes the optimal strategies for a team of rational players sharing the same goal and without the capability of correlating their strategies in strategic games against an adversary. This solution concept can capture situations in which an agent controls multiple resources-corresponding to the team members-that cannot communicate. It is known that such equilibrium always exists and it is unique (unless degeneracy) and these properties make it a credible solution concept to be used in real-world applications, especially in security scenarios. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the Team-maxmin equilibrium is almost completely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate bounds of (in)efficiency of the Team-maxmin equilibrium w.r.t. the Nash equilibria and w.r.t. the Maxmin equilibrium when the team members can play correlated strategies. Furthermore, we study a number of algorithms to find and/or approximate an equilibrium, discussing their theoretical guarantees and evaluating their performance by using a standard testbed of game instances.",1
"Hospital readmissions are expensive and reflect the inadequacies in healthcare system. In the United States alone, treatment of readmitted diabetic patients exceeds 250 million dollars per year. Early identification of patients facing a high risk of readmission can enable healthcare providers to to conduct additional investigations and possibly prevent future readmissions. This not only improves the quality of care but also reduces the medical expenses on readmission. Machine learning methods have been leveraged on public health data to build a system for identifying diabetic patients facing a high risk of future readmission. Number of inpatient visits, discharge disposition and admission type were identified as strong predictors of readmission. Further, it was found that the number of laboratory tests and discharge disposition together predict whether the patient will be readmitted shortly after being discharged from the hospital (i.e. &lt;30 days) or after a longer period of time (i.e. &gt;30 days). These insights can help healthcare providers to improve inpatient diabetic care. Finally, the cost analysis suggests that \$252.76 million can be saved across 98,053 diabetic patient encounters by incorporating the proposed cost sensitive analysis model.",0
"Wilson et al. propose a measure of flexibility in project scheduling problems and propose several ways of distributing flexibility over tasks without overrunning the deadline. These schedules prove quite robust: delays of some tasks do not necessarily lead to delays of subsequent tasks. The number of tasks that finish late depends, among others, on the way of distributing flexibility.",0
"In this paper we extend the influence diagram (ID) representation for decisions under uncertainty. In the standard ID, arrows into a decision node are only informational; they do not represent constraints on what the decision maker can do. We can represent such constraints only indirectly, using arrows to the children of the decision and sometimes adding more variables to the influence diagram, thus making the ID more complicated. Users of influence diagrams often want to represent constraints by arrows into decision nodes. We represent constraints on decisions by allowing relevance arrows into decision nodes. We call the resulting representation information/relevance influence diagrams (IRIDs). Information/relevance influence diagrams allow for direct representation and specification of constrained decisions. We use a combination of stochastic dynamic programming and Gibbs sampling to solve IRIDs. This method is especially useful when exact methods for solving IDs fail.",0
"Researchers have recently started investigating deep neural networks for dialogue applications. In particular, generative sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models have shown promising results for unstructured tasks, such as word-level dialogue response generation. The hope is that such models will be able to leverage massive amounts of data to learn meaningful natural language representations and response generation strategies, while requiring a minimum amount of domain knowledge and hand-crafting. An important challenge is to develop models that can effectively incorporate dialogue context and generate meaningful and diverse responses. In support of this goal, we review recently proposed models based on generative encoder-decoder neural network architectures, and show that these models have better ability to incorporate long-term dialogue history, to model uncertainty and ambiguity in dialogue, and to generate responses with high-level compositional structure.",0
"This paper tackles temporal resolution of documents, such as determining when a document is about or when it was written, based only on its text. We apply techniques from information retrieval that predict dates via language models over a discretized timeline. Unlike most previous works, we rely {\it solely} on temporal cues implicit in the text. We consider both document-likelihood and divergence based techniques and several smoothing methods for both of them. Our best model predicts the mid-point of individuals' lives with a median of 22 and mean error of 36 years for Wikipedia biographies from 3800 B.C. to the present day. We also show that this approach works well when training on such biographies and predicting dates both for non-biographical Wikipedia pages about specific years (500 B.C. to 2010 A.D.) and for publication dates of short stories (1798 to 2008). Together, our work shows that, even in absence of temporal extraction resources, it is possible to achieve remarkable temporal locality across a diverse set of texts.",0
"In this paper we propose an extension to the Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) that aims at aggregating a number of reasoning tasks into a one parallel run. The described approach consists in replacing real-valued activation levels of concepts (and further influence weights) by random variables. Such extension, followed by the implemented software tool, allows for determining ranges reached by concept activation levels, sensitivity analysis as well as statistical analysis of multiple reasoning results. We replace multiplication and addition operators appearing in the FCM state equation by appropriate convolutions applicable for discrete random variables. To make the model computationally feasible, it is further augmented with aggregation operations for discrete random variables. We discuss four implemented aggregators, as well as we report results of preliminary tests.",0
"Automatic segmentation of the liver and hepatic lesions is an important step towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and computer-aided decision support systems. This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation of a large-scale medical trial or quantitative image analysis. We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.",0
"Very large data sets are the common rule in automated mapping, GIS, remote sensing, and what we can name geo-information. Indeed, in 1983 Landsat was already delivering gigabytes of data, and other sensors were in orbit or ready for launch, and a tantamount of cartographic data was being digitized. The retrospective paper revisits several issues that geo-information sciences had to face from the early stages on, including: structure ( to bring some structure to the data registered from a sampled signal, metadata); processing (huge amounts of data for big computers and fast algorithms); uncertainty (the kinds of errors, their quantification); consistency (when merging different sources of data is logically allowed, and meaningful); ontologies (clear and agreed shared definitions, if any kind of decision should be based upon them). All these issues are the background of Internet queries, and the underlying technology has been shaped during those years when geo-information engineering emerged.",0
"Game theory's prescriptive power typically relies on full rationality and/or self-play interactions. In contrast, this work sets aside these fundamental premises and focuses instead on heterogeneous autonomous interactions between two or more agents. Specifically, we introduce a new and concise representation for repeated adversarial (constant-sum) games that highlight the necessary features that enable an automated planing agent to reason about how to score above the game's Nash equilibrium, when facing heterogeneous adversaries. To this end, we present TeamUP, a model-based RL algorithm designed for learning and planning such an abstraction. In essence, it is somewhat similar to R-max with a cleverly engineered reward shaping that treats exploration as an adversarial optimization problem. In practice, it attempts to find an ally with which to tacitly collude (in more than two-player games) and then collaborates on a joint plan of actions that can consistently score a high utility in adversarial repeated games. We use the inaugural Lemonade Stand Game Tournament to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that TeamUP is the best performing agent, demoting the Tournament's actual winning strategy into second place. In our experimental analysis, we show hat our strategy successfully and consistently builds collaborations with many different heterogeneous (and sometimes very sophisticated) adversaries.",0
"This paper presents a five-valued representation of bifuzzy sets. This representation is related to a five-valued logic that uses the following values: true, false, inconsistent, incomplete and ambiguous. In the framework of five-valued representation, formulae for similarity, entropy and syntropy of bifuzzy sets are constructed.",0
"We study the worst-case adaptive optimization problem with budget constraint. Unlike previous works, we consider the general setting where the cost is a set function on sets of decisions. For this setting, we investigate the near-optimality of greedy policies when the utility function satisfies a novel property called pointwise cost-sensitive submodularity. This property is an extension of cost-sensitive submodularity, which in turn is a generalization of submodularity to general cost functions. We prove that two simple greedy policies for the problem are not near-optimal but the best between them is near-optimal. With this result, we propose a combined policy that is near-optimal with respect to the optimal worst-case policy that uses half of the budget. We discuss applications of our theoretical results and also report experimental results comparing the greedy policies on the active learning problem.",1
"Search for binary sequences with a high figure of merit, also known as the low autocorrelation binary sequence problem, represents a formidable computational challenge. In 2003, two stochastic solvers reported computational complexity of $O(1.423^L)$ and $O(1.370^L)$, refined to $O(1.5097^L)$ and $O(1.4072^L)$ for L odd in this paper. The solvers from 2009, in our experiments, demonstrate average-case asymptotic performance of $114.515*1.3464^L$ for L even, and $320.360*1.3421^L$ for L odd.",0
The recently introduced Intelligent Trial and Error algorithm (IT\&amp;E) enables robots to creatively adapt to damage in a matter of minutes by combining an off-line evolutionary algorithm and an on-line learning algorithm based on Bayesian Optimization. We extend the IT\&amp;E algorithm to allow for robots to learn to compensate for damages while executing their task(s). This leads to a semi-episodic learning scheme that increases the robot's lifetime autonomy and adaptivity. Preliminary experiments on a toy simulation and a 6-legged robot locomotion task show promising results.,0
"Integrating diverse formalisms into modular knowledge representation systems offers increased expressivity, modeling convenience and computational benefits. We introduce concepts of abstract modules and abstract modular systems to study general principles behind the design and analysis of model-finding programs, or solvers, for integrated heterogeneous multi-logic systems. We show how abstract modules and abstract modular systems give rise to transition systems, which are a natural and convenient representation of solvers pioneered by the SAT community. We illustrate our approach by showing how it applies to answer set programming and propositional logic, and to multi-logic systems based on these two formalisms.",0
"Knowledge is attributed to human whose problem-solving behavior is subjective and complex. In today's knowledge economy, the need to manage knowledge produced by a community of actors cannot be overemphasized. This is due to the fact that actors possess some level of tacit knowledge which is generally difficult to articulate. Problem-solving requires searching and sharing of knowledge among a group of actors in a particular context. Knowledge expressed within the context of a problem resolution must be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, an approach that permits dynamic capitalization of relevant and reliable actors' knowledge in solving decision problem following Economic Intelligence process is proposed. Knowledge annotation method and temporal attributes are used for handling the complexity in the communication among actors and in contextualizing expressed knowledge. A prototype is built to demonstrate the functionalities of a collaborative Knowledge Management system based on this approach. It is tested with sample cases and the result showed that dynamic capitalization leads to knowledge validation hence increasing reliability of captured knowledge for reuse. The system can be adapted to various domains",0
"We define a property of intelligent systems, which we call Reflexivity. In human beings, it is one aspect of consciousness, and an element of deliberation. We propose a conjecture, that this property is conditioned by a topological property of the processes which implement this reflexivity. These processes may be symbolic, or non symbolic e.g. connexionnist. An architecture which implements reflexivity may be based on the interaction of one or several modules of deep learning, which may be specialized or not, and interconnected in a relevant way. A necessary condition of reflexivity is the existence of recurrence in its processes, we will examine in which cases this condition may be sufficient. We will then examine how this topology and this property make possible the expression of a second property, the deliberation. In a final paragraph, we propose an evaluation of intelligent systems, based on the fulfillment of all or some of these properties.",0
"Planning can often be simpli ed by decomposing the task into smaller tasks arranged hierarchically. Charlin et al. [4] recently showed that the hierarchy discovery problem can be framed as a non-convex optimization problem. However, the inherent computational di culty of solving such an optimization problem makes it hard to scale to realworld problems. In another line of research, Toussaint et al. [18] developed a method to solve planning problems by maximumlikelihood estimation. In this paper, we show how the hierarchy discovery problem in partially observable domains can be tackled using a similar maximum likelihood approach. Our technique rst transforms the problem into a dynamic Bayesian network through which a hierarchical structure can naturally be discovered while optimizing the policy. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales better than previous techniques based on non-convex optimization.",0
"In this paper, we provide more evidence for the contention that logical consequence should be understood in normative terms. Hartry Field and John MacFarlane covered the classical case. We extend their work, examining what it means for an agent to be obliged to infer a conclusion when faced with uncertain information or reasoning within a non-monotonic, defeasible, logical framework (which allows e. g. for inference to be drawn from premises considered true unless evidence to the contrary is presented).",0
"Video games can be used as an excellent test bed for Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. They are challenging and non-deterministic, this makes it very difficult to write strong AI players. An example of such a video game is Ms. Pac-Man. In this paper we will outline some of the previous techniques used to build AI controllers for Ms. Pac-Man as well as presenting a new and novel solution. My technique utilises a Cellular Automaton (CA) to build a representation of the environment at each time step of the game. The basis of the representation is a 2-D grid of cells. Each cell has a state and a set of rules which determine whether or not that cell will dominate (i.e. pass its state value onto) adjacent cells at each update. Once a certain number of update iterations have been completed, the CA represents the state of the environment in the game, the goals and the dangers. At this point, Ms. Pac-Man will decide her next move based only on her adjacent cells, that is to say, she has no knowledge of the state of the environment as a whole, she will simply follow the strongest path. This technique shows promise and allows the controller to achieve high scores in a live game, the behaviour it exhibits is interesting and complex. Moreover, this behaviour is produced by using very simple rules which are applied many times to each cell in the grid. Simple local interactions with complex global results are truly achieved.",0
"Default logic encounters some conceptual difficulties in representing common sense reasoning tasks. We argue that we should not try to formulate modular default rules that are presumed to work in all or most circumstances. We need to take into account the importance of the context which is continuously evolving during the reasoning process. Sequential thresholding is a quantitative counterpart of default logic which makes explicit the role context plays in the construction of a non-monotonic extension. We present a semantic characterization of generic non-monotonic reasoning, as well as the instantiations pertaining to default logic and sequential thresholding. This provides a link between the two mechanisms as well as a way to integrate the two that can be beneficial to both.",0
"Recent improvement on Tarski's procedure for quantifier elimination in the first order theory of real numbers makes it feasible to solve small instances of the following problems completely automatically: 1. listing all equality and inequality constraints implied by a graphical model with hidden variables. 2. Comparing graphyical models with hidden variables (i.e., model equivalence, inclusion, and overlap). 3. Answering questions about the identification of a model or portion of a model, and about bounds on quantities derived from a model. 4. Determing whether a given set of independence assertions. We discuss the foundation of quantifier elimination and demonstrate its application to these problems.",0
"Search is a central problem in artificial intelligence, and BFS and DFS the two most fundamental ways to search. In this report we derive results for average BFS and DFS runtime: For tree search, we employ a probabilistic model of goal distribution; for graph search, the analysis depends on an additional statistic of path redundancy and average branching factor. As an application, we use the results on two concrete grammar problems. The runtime estimates can be used to select the faster out of BFS and DFS for a given problem, and may form the basis for further analysis of more advanced search methods. Finally, we verify our results experimentally; the analytical approximations come surprisingly close to empirical reality.",0
"Real-time heuristic search algorithms satisfy a constant bound on the amount of planning per action, independent of problem size. As a result, they scale up well as problems become larger. This property would make them well suited for video games where Artificial Intelligence controlled agents must react quickly to user commands and to other agents actions. On the downside, real-time search algorithms employ learning methods that frequently lead to poor solution quality and cause the agent to appear irrational by re-visiting the same problem states repeatedly. The situation changed recently with a new algorithm, D LRTA*, which attempted to eliminate learning by automatically selecting subgoals. D LRTA* is well poised for video games, except it has a complex and memory-demanding pre-computation phase during which it builds a database of subgoals. In this paper, we propose a simpler and more memory-efficient way of pre-computing subgoals thereby eliminating the main obstacle to applying state-of-the-art real-time search methods in video games. The new algorithm solves a number of randomly chosen problems off-line, compresses the solutions into a series of subgoals and stores them in a database. When presented with a novel problem on-line, it queries the database for the most similar previously solved case and uses its subgoals to solve the problem. In the domain of pathfinding on four large video game maps, the new algorithm delivers solutions eight times better while using 57 times less memory and requiring 14% less pre-computation time.",0
"Robust search procedures are a central component in the design of black-box constraint-programming solvers. This paper proposes activity-based search, the idea of using the activity of variables during propagation to guide the search. Activity-based search was compared experimentally to impact-based search and the WDEG heuristics. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that activity-based search is more robust than other heuristics and may produce significant improvements in performance.",0
"Most games have, or can be generalised to have, a number of parameters that may be varied in order to provide instances of games that lead to very different player experiences. The space of possible parameter settings can be seen as a search space, and we can therefore use a Random Mutation Hill Climbing algorithm or other search methods to find the parameter settings that induce the best games. One of the hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function. In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.",0
"In this paper we introduce the Wastewater Treatment Plant Problem, a real-world scheduling problem, and compare the performance of several tools on it. We show that, for a naive modeling, state-of-the-art SMT solvers outperform other tools ranging from mathematical programming to constraint programming. We use both real and randomly generated benchmarks.",0
"Questions play a prominent role in social interactions, performing rhetorical functions that go beyond that of simple informational exchange. The surface form of a question can signal the intention and background of the person asking it, as well as the nature of their relation with the interlocutor. While the informational nature of questions has been extensively examined in the context of question-answering applications, their rhetorical aspects have been largely understudied.",1
"In classical machine learning, regression is treated as a black box process of identifying a suitable function from a hypothesis set without attempting to gain insight into the mechanism connecting inputs and outputs. In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.",0
"There is available an ever-increasing variety of procedures for managing uncertainty. These methods are discussed in the literature of artificial intelligence, as well as in the literature of philosophy of science. Heretofore these methods have been evaluated by intuition, discussion, and the general philosophical method of argument and counterexample. Almost any method of uncertainty management will have the property that in the long run it will deliver numbers approaching the relative frequency of the kinds of events at issue. To find a measure that will provide a meaningful evaluation of these treatments of uncertainty, we must look, not at the long run, but at the short or intermediate run. Our project attempts to develop such a measure in terms of short or intermediate length performance. We represent the effects of practical choices by the outcomes of bets offered to agents characterized by two uncertainty management approaches: the subjective Bayesian approach and the Classical confidence interval approach. Experimental evaluation suggests that the confidence interval approach can outperform the subjective approach in the relatively short run.",0
"We present an approach to labeling short video clips with English verbs as event descriptions. A key distinguishing aspect of this work is that it labels videos with verbs that describe the spatiotemporal interaction between event participants, humans and objects interacting with each other, abstracting away all object-class information and fine-grained image characteristics, and relying solely on the coarse-grained motion of the event participants. We apply our approach to a large set of 22 distinct verb classes and a corpus of 2,584 videos, yielding two surprising outcomes. First, a classification accuracy of greater than 70% on a 1-out-of-22 labeling task and greater than 85% on a variety of 1-out-of-10 subsets of this labeling task is independent of the choice of which of two different time-series classifiers we employ. Second, we achieve this level of accuracy using a highly impoverished intermediate representation consisting solely of the bounding boxes of one or two event participants as a function of time. This indicates that successful event recognition depends more on the choice of appropriate features that characterize the linguistic invariants of the event classes than on the particular classifier algorithms.",0
"In a Bayesian network, we wish to evaluate the marginal probability of a query variable, which may be conditioned on the observed values of some evidence variables. Here we first present our ""border algorithm,"" which converts a BN into a directed chain. For the polytrees, we then present in details, with some modifications and within the border algorithm framework, the ""revised polytree algorithm"" by Peot &amp; Shachter (1991). Finally, we present our ""parentless polytree method,"" which, coupled with the border algorithm, converts any Bayesian network into a polytree, rendering the complexity of our inferences independent of the size of network, and linear with the number of its evidence and query variables. All quantities in this paper have probabilistic interpretations.",0

"With the emerging technologies and all associated devices, it is predicted that massive amount of data will be created in the next few years, in fact, as much as 90% of current data were created in the last couple of years,a trend that will continue for the foreseeable future. Sustainable computing studies the process by which computer engineer/scientist designs computers and associated subsystems efficiently and effectively with minimal impact on the environment. However, current intelligent machine-learning systems are performance driven, the focus is on the predictive/classification accuracy, based on known properties learned from the training samples. For instance, most machine-learning-based nonparametric models are known to require high computational cost in order to find the global optima. With the learning task in a large dataset, the number of hidden nodes within the network will therefore increase significantly, which eventually leads to an exponential rise in computational complexity. This paper thus reviews the theoretical and experimental data-modeling literature, in large-scale data-intensive fields, relating to: (1) model efficiency, including computational requirements in learning, and data-intensive areas structure and design, and introduces (2) new algorithmic approaches with the least memory requirements and processing to minimize computational cost, while maintaining/improving its predictive/classification accuracy and stability.",0
"The success of deep learning depends on finding an architecture to fit the task. As deep learning has scaled up to more challenging tasks, the architectures have become difficult to design by hand. This paper proposes an automated method, CoDeepNEAT, for optimizing deep learning architectures through evolution. By extending existing neuroevolution methods to topology, components, and hyperparameters, this method achieves results comparable to best human designs in standard benchmarks in object recognition and language modeling. It also supports building a real-world application of automated image captioning on a magazine website. Given the anticipated increases in available computing power, evolution of deep networks is promising approach to constructing deep learning applications in the future.",0
"The Minimum Vertex Cover (MinVC) problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. Recently there has been great interest in solving this problem on real-world massive graphs. For such graphs, local search is a promising approach to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. In this paper we propose a local search algorithm that exploits reduction rules and data structures to solve the MinVC problem in such graphs. Experimental results on a wide range of real-word massive graphs show that our algorithm finds better covers than state-of-the-art local search algorithms for MinVC. Also we present interesting results about the complexities of some well-known heuristics.",0
"Narrative, and in particular storytelling, is an important part of the human experience. Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative can be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One of the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative generation, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are many factors -- logical and aesthetic -- that contribute to the success of a narrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue that the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical causal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character believability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by characters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief. Specifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional agents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique for solving the narrative generation problem -- to find a sound and believable sequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a world state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement search planning algorithm -- the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL) planner -- that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression, reasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals that explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those characters commit to their goals. We present the results of an empirical evaluation that demonstrates that narrative plans generated by the IPOCL algorithm support audience comprehension of character intentions better than plans generated by conventional partial-order planners.",0
"Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task. However, an agent that is trained using reinforcement learning is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function. Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to achieve, specified as goal states. The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent. Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment. Our method can also learn to achieve tasks with sparse rewards, which traditionally pose significant challenges.",0
"Generative models in vision have seen rapid progress due to algorithmic improvements and the availability of high-quality image datasets. In this paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and expressive.",1
"A perfectly rational decision-maker chooses the best action with the highest utility gain from a set of possible actions. The optimality principles that describe such decision processes do not take into account the computational costs of finding the optimal action. Bounded rational decision-making addresses this problem by specifically trading off information-processing costs and expected utility. Interestingly, a similar trade-off between energy and entropy arises when describing changes in thermodynamic systems. This similarity has been recently used to describe bounded rational agents. Crucially, this framework assumes that the environment does not change while the decision-maker is computing the optimal policy. When this requirement is not fulfilled, the decision-maker will suffer inefficiencies in utility, that arise because the current policy is optimal for an environment in the past. Here we borrow concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics to quantify these inefficiencies and illustrate with simulations its relationship with computational resources.",0
"This work introduces a method to tune a sequence-based generative model for molecular de novo design that through augmented episodic likelihood can learn to generate structures with certain specified desirable properties. We demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor D2, the model generates structures of which more than 95% are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.",0
"The number $R(4,3,3)$ is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with the best chances of being found ""soon"". Yet, its precise value has remained unknown for almost 50 years. This paper presents a methodology based on \emph{abstraction} and \emph{symmetry breaking} that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by using it to compute the value $R(4,3,3)=30$. Along the way it is required to first compute the previously unknown set ${\cal R}(3,3,3;13)$ consisting of 78{,}892 Ramsey colorings.",0
"A control strategy for expert systems is presented which is based on Shafer's Belief theory and the combination rule of Dempster. In contrast to well known strategies it is not sequentially and hypotheses-driven, but parallel and self organizing, determined by the concept of information gain. The information gain, calculated as the maximal difference between the actual evidence distribution in the knowledge base and the potential evidence determines each consultation step. Hierarchically structured knowledge is an important representation form and experts even use several hierarchies in parallel for constituting their knowledge. Hence the control strategy is applied to a layered set of distinct hierarchies. Depending on the actual data one of these hierarchies is chosen by the control strategy for the next step in the reasoning process. Provided the actual data are well matched to the structure of one hierarchy, this hierarchy remains selected for a longer consultation time. If no good match can be achieved, a switch from the actual hierarchy to a competing one will result, very similar to the phenomenon of restructuring in problem solving tasks. Up to now the control strategy is restricted to multi hierarchical knowledge bases with disjunct hierarchies. It is implemented in the expert system IBIG (inference by information gain), being presently applied to acquired speech disorders (aphasia).",0

"Rankings are widely used in many information systems. In information retrieval, a ranking is a list of ordered documents, in which a document with lower position has higher ranking score than the documents behind it. This paper studies the consensus measure for a given set of rankings, in order to understand the degree to which the rankings agree and the extent to which the rankings are related. The proposed multi-facet approach, without the need for pairwise comparison between rankings, allows to measure the consensus in a set of rankings, with respect to the length of common patterns, the number of common patterns for a given length, and the number of all common patterns. The experiments show that the proposed approach can be used to compare the search engines in terms of closeness of the returned results when semantically related key words are sent to them.",0
"Artificial General Intelligence is a field of research aiming to distill the principles of intelligence that operate independently of a specific problem domain or a predefined context and utilize these principles in order to synthesize systems capable of performing any intellectual task a human being is capable of and eventually go beyond that. While ""narrow"" artificial intelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech recognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion, etc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding general intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical approach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief introduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number of serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence perceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a priori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative process of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We call this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed as an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application can be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three facets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making and the individuation of general cognitive agents. We further show how open-ended intelligence can be framed in terms of a distributed, self-organizing network of interacting elements and how such process is scalable. The framework highlights an important relation between coordination and intelligence and a new understanding of values. We conclude with a number of questions for future research.",0
"We report our initial investigations into reliability and path-finding based models and propose future areas of interest. Inspired by broken sidewalks during on-campus construction projects, we develop two models for navigating this ""unreliable network."" These are based on a concept of ""accumulating risk"" backward from the destination, and both operate on directed acyclic graphs with a probability of failure associated with each edge. The first serves to introduce and has faults addressed by the second, more conservative model. Next, we show a paradox when these models are used to construct polynomials on conceptual networks, such as design processes and software development life cycles. When the risk of a network increases uniformly, the most reliable path changes from wider and longer to shorter and narrower. If we let professional inexperience--such as with entry level cooks and software developers--represent probability of edge failure, does this change in path imply that the novice should follow instructions with fewer ""back-up"" plans, yet those with alternative routes should be followed by the expert?",0
"In this paper we present a new neurobiologically-inspired affective cognitive architecture: NEUCOGAR (NEUromodulating COGnitive ARchitecture). The objective of NEUCOGAR is the identification of a mapping from the influence of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline to the computing processes based on Von Neuman's architecture, in order to implement affective phenomena which can operate on the Turing's machine model. As basis of the modeling we use and extend the L\""ovheim Cube of Emotion with parameters of the Von Neumann architecture. Validation is conducted via simulation on a computing system of dopamine neuromodulation and its effects on the Cortex. In the experimental phase of the project, the increase of computing power and storage redistribution due to emotion stimulus modulated by the dopamine system, confirmed the soundness of the model.",0
"In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data.",0
"Process mining techniques aim to extract insights in processes from event logs. One of the challenges in process mining is identifying interesting and meaningful event labels that contribute to a better understanding of the process. Our application area is mining data from smart homes for elderly, where the ultimate goal is to signal deviations from usual behavior and provide timely recommendations in order to extend the period of independent living. Extracting individual process models showing user behavior is an important instrument in achieving this goal. However, the interpretation of sensor data at an appropriate abstraction level is not straightforward. For example, a motion sensor in a bedroom can be triggered by tossing and turning in bed or by getting up. We try to derive the actual activity depending on the context (time, previous events, etc.). In this paper we introduce the notion of label refinements, which links more abstract event descriptions with their more refined counterparts. We present a statistical evaluation method to determine the usefulness of a label refinement for a given event log from a process perspective. Based on data from smart homes, we show how our statistical evaluation method for label refinements can be used in practice. Our method was able to select two label refinements out of a set of candidate label refinements that both had a positive effect on model precision.",0
"Given an undirected graph G or hypergraph X model for a given set of variables V, we introduce two marginalization operators for obtaining the undirected graph GA or hypergraph HA associated with a given subset A c V such that the marginal distribution of A factorizes according to GA or HA, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the method by its application to some practical examples. With them we show that hypergraph models allow defining a finer factorization or performing a more precise conditional independence analysis than undirected graph models.",0
"We address the problem of planning collision-free paths for multiple agents using optimization methods known as proximal algorithms. Recently this approach was explored in Bento et al. 2013, which demonstrated its ease of parallelization and decentralization, the speed with which the algorithms generate good quality solutions, and its ability to incorporate different proximal operators, each ensuring that paths satisfy a desired property. Unfortunately, the operators derived only apply to paths in 2D and require that any intermediate waypoints we might want agents to follow be preassigned to specific agents, limiting their range of applicability. In this paper we resolve these limitations. We introduce new operators to deal with agents moving in arbitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2D predecessors and we introduce landmarks, space-time positions that are automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several numerical experiments.",1
"An approach for game bot detection in MMORPGs is proposed based on the analysis of game playing behavior. Since MMORPGs are large scale games, users can play in various ways. This variety in playing behavior makes it hard to detect game bots based on play behaviors. In order to cope with this problem, the proposed approach observes game playing behaviors of users and groups them by their behavioral similarities. Then, it develops a local bot detection model for each player group. Since the locally optimized models can more accurately detect game bots within each player group, the combination of those models brings about overall improvement. For a practical purpose of reducing the workloads of the game servers in service, the game data is collected at a low resolution in time. Behavioral features are selected and developed to accurately detect game bots with the low resolution data, considering common aspects of MMORPG playing. Through the experiment with the real data from a game currently in service, it is shown that the proposed local model approach yields more accurate results.",0
"Bayes-optimal behavior, while well-defined, is often difficult to achieve. Recent advances in the use of Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) have shown that it is possible to act near-optimally in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with very large or infinite state spaces. Bayes-optimal behavior in an unknown MDP is equivalent to optimal behavior in the known belief-space MDP, although the size of this belief-space MDP grows exponentially with the amount of history retained, and is potentially infinite. We show how an agent can use one particular MCTS algorithm, Forward Search Sparse Sampling (FSSS), in an efficient way to act nearly Bayes-optimally for all but a polynomial number of steps, assuming that FSSS can be used to act efficiently in any possible underlying MDP.",0
"This paper presents a multilayered architecture that enhances the capabilities of current QA systems and allows different types of complex questions or queries to be processed. The answers to these questions need to be gathered from factual information scattered throughout different documents. Specifically, we designed a specialized layer to process the different types of temporal questions. Complex temporal questions are first decomposed into simple questions, according to the temporal relations expressed in the original question. In the same way, the answers to the resulting simple questions are recomposed, fulfilling the temporal restrictions of the original complex question. A novel aspect of this approach resides in the decomposition which uses a minimal quantity of resources, with the final aim of obtaining a portable platform that is easily extensible to other languages. In this paper we also present a methodology for evaluation of the decomposition of the questions as well as the ability of the implemented temporal layer to perform at a multilingual level. The temporal layer was first performed for English, then evaluated and compared with: a) a general purpose QA system (F-measure 65.47% for QA plus English temporal layer vs. 38.01% for the general QA system), and b) a well-known QA system. Much better results were obtained for temporal questions with the multilayered system. This system was therefore extended to Spanish and very good results were again obtained in the evaluation (F-measure 40.36% for QA plus Spanish temporal layer vs. 22.94% for the general QA system).",0
"The recently launched LinkedIn Salary product has been designed to realize the vision of helping the world's professionals optimize their earning potential through salary transparency. We describe the overall design and architecture of the salary modeling system underlying this product. We focus on the unique data mining challenges in designing and implementing the system, and describe the modeling components such as outlier detection and Bayesian hierarchical smoothing that help to compute and present robust compensation insights to users. We report on extensive evaluation with nearly one year of anonymized compensation data collected from over one million LinkedIn users, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the statistical models. We also highlight the lessons learned through the deployment of our system at LinkedIn.",0
"In this paper, we present a novel approach for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) where, we control cursor movement using a real-time camera. Current methods involve changing mouse parts such as adding more buttons or changing the position of the tracking ball. Instead, our method is to use a camera and computer vision technology, such as image segmentation and gesture recognition, to control mouse tasks (left and right clicking, double-clicking, and scrolling) and we show how it can perform everything as current mouse devices can. The software will be developed in JAVA language. Recognition and pose estimation in this system are user independent and robust as we will be using colour tapes on our finger to perform actions. The software can be used as an intuitive input interface to applications that require multi-dimensional control e.g. computer games etc.",0
"Providing an efficient strategy to navigate safely through unsignaled intersections is a difficult task that requires determining the intent of other drivers. We explore the effectiveness of using Deep Reinforcement Learning to handle intersection problems. Combining several recent advances in Deep RL, were we able to learn policies that surpass the performance of a commonly-used heuristic approach in several metrics including task completion time and goal success rate. Our analysis, and the solutions learned by the network point out several short comings of current rule-based methods. The fact that Deep RL policies resulted in collisions, although rarely, combined with the limitations of the policy to generalize well to out-of-sample scenarios suggest a need for further research.",0
"Using SMS (Short Message System), cell phones can be used to query for information about various topics. In an SMS based search system, one of the key problems is to identify a domain (broad topic) associated with the user query; so that a more comprehensive search can be carried out by the domain specific search engine. In this paper we use a rule based approach, to identify the domain, called Short Query Intent Identification System (SQIIS). We construct two different rule-bases using different strategies to suit query intent identification. We evaluate the two rule-bases experimentally.",0
"This article presents the prediction difference analysis method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input. When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).",1
"Possibilistic logic offers a qualitative framework for representing pieces of information associated with levels of uncertainty of priority. The fusion of multiple sources information is discussed in this setting. Different classes of merging operators are considered including conjunctive, disjunctive, reinforcement, adaptive and averaging operators. Then we propose to analyse these classes in terms of postulates. This is done by first extending the postulate for merging classical bases to the case where priorites are avaialbe.",0
"In this paper we introduce RankPL, a modeling language that can be thought of as a qualitative variant of a probabilistic programming language with a semantics based on Spohn's ranking theory. Broadly speaking, RankPL can be used to represent and reason about processes that exhibit uncertainty expressible by distinguishing ""normal"" from"" surprising"" events. RankPL allows (iterated) revision of rankings over alternative program states and supports various types of reasoning, including abduction and causal inference. We present the language, its denotational semantics, and a number of practical examples. We also discuss an implementation of RankPL that is available for download.",0
"We present a rational analysis of curiosity, proposing that people's curiosity is driven by seeking stimuli that maximize their ability to make appropriate responses in the future. This perspective offers a way to unify previous theories of curiosity into a single framework. Experimental results confirm our model's predictions, showing how the relationship between curiosity and confidence can change significantly depending on the nature of the environment.",0
"Among classical search algorithms with the same heuristic information, with sufficient memory A* is essentially as fast as possible in finding a proven optimal solution. However, in many situations optimal solutions are simply infeasible, and thus search algorithms that trade solution quality for speed are desirable. In this paper, we formalize the process of classical search as a metalevel decision problem, the Abstract Search MDP. For any given optimization criterion, this establishes a well-defined notion of the best possible behaviour for a search algorithm and offers a theoretical approach to the design of algorithms for that criterion. We proceed to approximately solve a version of the Abstract Search MDP for anytime algorithms and thus derive a novel search algorithm, Search by Maximizing the Incremental Rate of Improvement (SMIRI). SMIRI is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art anytime search algorithms on a parametrized stochastic tree model for most of the tested parameter values.",0
"In the study of human learning, there is broad evidence that our ability to retain a piece of information improves with repeated exposure, and that it decays with delay since the last exposure. This plays a crucial role in the design of educational software, leading to a trade-off between teaching new material and reviewing what has already been taught. A common way to balance this trade-off is via spaced repetition -- using periodic review of content to improve long-term retention. Though widely used in practice, there is little formal understanding of the design of these systems. This paper addresses this gap. First, we mine log data from a spaced repetition system to establish the functional dependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, based on this memory model, we develop a mathematical framework for spaced repetition systems using a queueing-network approach. This model formalizes the popular Leitner Heuristic for spaced repetition, providing the first rigorous and computationally tractable means of optimizing the review schedule. Finally, we empirically confirm the validity of our formal model via a Mechanical Turk experiment. In particular, we verify a key qualitative insight and prediction of our model -- the existence of a sharp phase transition in learning outcomes upon increasing the rate of new item introductions.",0
"Load disaggregation based on aided linear integer programming (ALIP) is proposed. We start with a conventional linear integer programming (IP) based disaggregation and enhance it in several ways. The enhancements include additional constraints, correction based on a state diagram, median filtering, and linear programming-based refinement. With the aid of these enhancements, the performance of IP-based disaggregation is significantly improved. The proposed ALIP system relies only on the instantaneous load samples instead of waveform signatures, and hence does not crucially depend on high sampling frequency. Experimental results show that the proposed ALIP system performs better than the conventional IP-based load disaggregation system.",0
"Cognitive engineering is a multi-disciplinary field and hence it is difficult to find a review article consolidating the leading developments in the field. The in-credible pace at which technology is advancing pushes the boundaries of what is achievable in cognitive engineering. There are also differing approaches to cognitive engineering brought about from the multi-disciplinary nature of the field and the vastness of possible applications. Thus research communities require more frequent reviews to keep up to date with the latest trends. In this paper we shall dis-cuss some of the approaches to cognitive engineering holistically to clarify the reasoning behind the different approaches and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We shall then show how developments from seemingly disjointed views could be integrated to achieve the same goal of creating cognitive machines. By reviewing the major contributions in the different fields and showing the potential for a combined approach, this work intends to assist the research community in devising more unified methods and techniques for developing cognitive machines.",0
"This is a working paper summarizing results of an ongoing research project whose aim is to uniquely characterize the uncertainty measure for the Dempster-Shafer Theory. A set of intuitive axiomatic requirements is presented, some of their implications are shown, and the proof is given of the minimality of recently proposed measure AU among all measures satisfying the proposed requirements.",0
"Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information. To deal with these challenging domains, prior work has focused on computing Nash equilibria in a handcrafted abstraction of the domain. In this paper we introduce the first scalable end-to-end approach to learning approximate Nash equilibria without any prior knowledge. Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning. When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged. In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a competitive strategy that approached the performance of human experts and state-of-the-art methods.",0
"The need to help people choose among large numbers of items and to filter through large amounts of information has led to a flood of research in construction of personal recommendation agents. One of the central issues in constructing such agents is the representation and elicitation of user preferences or interests. This topic has long been studied in Decision Theory, but surprisingly little work in the area of recommender systems has made use of formal decision-theoretic techniques. This paper describes DIVA, a decision-theoretic agent for recommending movies that contains a number of novel features. DIVA represents user preferences using pairwise comparisons among items, rather than numeric ratings. It uses a novel similarity measure based on the concept of the probability of conflict between two orderings of items. The system has a rich representation of preference, distinguishing between a user's general taste in movies and his immediate interests. It takes an incremental approach to preference elicitation in which the user can provide feedback if not satisfied with the recommendation list. We empirically evaluate the performance of the system using the EachMovie collaborative filtering database.",0
"In this book authors for the first time introduce the notion of strong neutrosophic graphs. They are very different from the usual graphs and neutrosophic graphs. Using these new structures special subgraph topological spaces are defined. Further special lattice graph of subgraphs of these graphs are defined and described. Several interesting properties using subgraphs of a strong neutrosophic graph are obtained. Several open conjectures are proposed. These new class of strong neutrosophic graphs will certainly find applications in Neutrosophic Cognitive Maps (NCM), Neutrosophic Relational Maps (NRM) and Neutrosophic Relational Equations (NRE) with appropriate modifications.",0
"To harness modern multicore processors, it is imperative to develop parallel versions of fundamental algorithms. In this paper, we compare different approaches to parallel best-first search in a shared-memory setting. We present a new method, PBNF, that uses abstraction to partition the state space and to detect duplicate states without requiring frequent locking. PBNF allows speculative expansions when necessary to keep threads busy. We identify and fix potential livelock conditions in our approach, proving its correctness using temporal logic. Our approach is general, allowing it to extend easily to suboptimal and anytime heuristic search. In an empirical comparison on STRIPS planning, grid pathfinding, and sliding tile puzzle problems using 8-core machines, we show that A*, weighted A* and Anytime weighted A* implemented using PBNF yield faster search than improved versions of previous parallel search proposals.",0
"Much of current machine learning (ML) research has lost its connection to problems of import to the larger world of science and society. From this perspective, there exist glaring limitations in the data sets we investigate, the metrics we employ for evaluation, and the degree to which results are communicated back to their originating domains. What changes are needed to how we conduct research to increase the impact that ML has? We present six Impact Challenges to explicitly focus the field?s energy and attention, and we discuss existing obstacles that must be addressed. We aim to inspire ongoing discussion and focus on ML that matters.",1
"When searching for characteristic subpatterns in potentially noisy graph data, it appears self-evident that having multiple observations would be better than having just one. However, it turns out that the inconsistencies introduced when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding maximum weighted cliques.",1
"Automation and computer intelligence to support complex human decisions becomes essential to manage large and distributed systems in the Cloud and IoT era. Understanding the root cause of an observed symptom in a complex system has been a major problem for decades. As industry dives into the IoT world and the amount of data generated per year grows at an amazing speed, an important question is how to find appropriate mechanisms to determine root causes that can handle huge amounts of data or may provide valuable feedback in real-time. While many survey papers aim at summarizing the landscape of techniques for modelling system behavior and infering the root cause of a problem based in the resulting models, none of those focuses on analyzing how the different techniques in the literature fit growing requirements in terms of performance and scalability. In this survey, we provide a review of root-cause analysis, focusing on these particular aspects. We also provide guidance to choose the best root-cause analysis strategy depending on the requirements of a particular system and application.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an expressive knowledge representation and reasoning framework. Due to its rather simple syntax paired with high-performance solvers, ASP is interesting for industrial applications. However, to err is human and thus debugging is an important activity during the development process. Therefore, tools for debugging non-ground answer set programs are needed. In this paper, we present a new graphical debugging interface for non-ground answer set programs. The tool is based on the recently-introduced DWASP approach for debugging and it simplifies the interaction with the debugger. Furthermore, the debugging interface is integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs. With our extension ASPIDE turns into a full-fledged IDE by offering debugging support.",0
"Dung's abstract argumentation theory is a widely used formalism to model conflicting information and to draw conclusions in such situations. Hereby, the knowledge is represented by so-called argumentation frameworks (AFs) and the reasoning is done via semantics extracting acceptable sets. All reasonable semantics are based on the notion of conflict-freeness which means that arguments are only jointly acceptable when they are not linked within the AF. In this paper, we study the question which information on top of conflict-free sets is needed to compute extensions of a semantics at hand. We introduce a hierarchy of so-called verification classes specifying the required amount of information. We show that well-known standard semantics are exactly verifiable through a certain such class. Our framework also gives a means to study semantics lying inbetween known semantics, thus contributing to a more abstract understanding of the different features argumentation semantics offer.",0
"In the context of using norms for controlling multi-agent systems, a vitally important question that has not yet been addressed in the literature is the development of mechanisms for monitoring norm compliance under partial action observability. This paper proposes the reconstruction of unobserved actions to tackle this problem. In particular, we formalise the problem of reconstructing unobserved actions, and propose an information model and algorithms for monitoring norms under partial action observability using two different processes for reconstructing unobserved actions. Our evaluation shows that reconstructing unobserved actions increases significantly the number of norm violations and fulfilments detected.",0
"Designing a search heuristic for constraint programming that is reliable across problem domains has been an important research topic in recent years. This paper concentrates on one family of candidates: counting-based search. Such heuristics seek to make branching decisions that preserve most of the solutions by determining what proportion of solutions to each individual constraint agree with that decision. Whereas most generic search heuristics in constraint programming rely on local information at the level of the individual variable, our search heuristics are based on more global information at the constraint level. We design several algorithms that are used to count the number of solutions to specific families of constraints and propose some search heuristics exploiting such information. The experimental part of the paper considers eight problem domains ranging from well-established benchmark puzzles to rostering and sport scheduling. An initial empirical analysis identifies heuristic maxSD as a robust candidate among our proposals.eWe then evaluate the latter against the state of the art, including the latest generic search heuristics, restarts, and discrepancy-based tree traversals. Experimental results show that counting-based search generally outperforms other generic heuristics.",0
"Answering conjunctive queries (CQs) over a set of facts extended with existential rules is a prominent problem in knowledge representation and databases. This problem can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends the given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the chase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of facts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether the chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous acyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase termination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called model-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA). Furthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that MFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.",0

This approach involves a special triangulation of the underlying graph, the construction of a junction tree with special properties, and a message passing algorithm operating on the junction tree for computation of expected utilities and optimal decision policies.",0
"Backward simulation is an approximate inference technique for Bayesian belief networks. It differs from existing simulation methods in that it starts simulation from the known evidence and works backward (i.e., contrary to the direction of the arcs). The technique's focus on the evidence leads to improved convergence in situations where the posterior beliefs are dominated by the evidence rather than by the prior probabilities. Since this class of situations is large, the technique may make practical the application of approximate inference in Bayesian belief networks to many real-world problems.",0
"Translations between different nonmonotonic formalisms always have been an important topic in the field, in particular to understand the knowledge-representation capabilities those formalisms offer. We provide such an investigation in terms of different semantics proposed for abstract argumentation frameworks, a nonmonotonic yet simple formalism which received increasing interest within the last decade. Although the properties of these different semantics are nowadays well understood, there are no explicit results about intertranslatability. We provide such translations wrt. different properties and also give a few novel complexity results which underlie some negative results.",0
"Today, University Timetabling problems are occurred annually and they are often hard and time consuming to solve. This paper describes Hyper Heuristics (HH) method based on Great Deluge (GD) and its variants for solving large, highly constrained timetabling problems from different domains. Generally, in hyper heuristic framework, there are two main stages: heuristic selection and move acceptance. This paper emphasizes on the latter stage to develop Hyper Heuristic (HH) framework. The main contribution of this paper is that Great Deluge (GD) and its variants: Flex Deluge(FD), Non-linear(NLGD), Extended Great Deluge(EGD) are used as move acceptance method in HH by combining Reinforcement learning (RL).These HH methods are tested on exam benchmark timetabling problem and best results and comparison analysis are reported.",0
"Evolutionary algorithms have been frequently applied to constrained continuous optimisation problems. We carry out feature based comparisons of different types of evolutionary algorithms such as evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle swarm optimisation for constrained continuous optimisation. In our study, we examine how sets of constraints influence the difficulty of obtaining close to optimal solutions. Using a multi-objective approach, we evolve constrained continuous problems having a set of linear and/or quadratic constraints where the different evolutionary approaches show a significant difference in performance. Afterwards, we discuss the features of the constraints that exhibit a difference in performance of the different evolutionary approaches under consideration.",0
"Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established paradigm of declarative programming in close relationship with other declarative formalisms such as SAT Modulo Theories, Constraint Handling Rules, FO(.), PDDL and many others. Since its first informal editions, ASP systems have been compared in the now well-established ASP Competition. The Third (Open) ASP Competition, as the sequel to the ASP Competitions Series held at the University of Potsdam in Germany (2006-2007) and at the University of Leuven in Belgium in 2009, took place at the University of Calabria (Italy) in the first half of 2011. Participants competed on a pre-selected collection of benchmark problems, taken from a variety of domains as well as real world applications. The Competition ran on two tracks: the Model and Solve (M&amp;S) Track, based on an open problem encoding, and open language, and open to any kind of system based on a declarative specification paradigm; and the System Track, run on the basis of fixed, public problem encodings, written in a standard ASP language. This paper discusses the format of the Competition and the rationale behind it, then reports the results for both tracks. Comparison with the second ASP competition and state-of-the-art solutions for some of the benchmark domains is eventually discussed.",0
"We introduce the dependent doors problem as an abstraction for situations in which one must perform a sequence of possibly dependent decisions, without receiving feedback information on the effectiveness of previously made actions. Informally, the problem considers a set of $d$ doors that are initially closed, and the aim is to open all of them as fast as possible. To open a door, the algorithm knocks on it and it might open or not according to some probability distribution. This distribution may depend on which other doors are currently open, as well as on which other doors were open during each of the previous knocks on that door. The algorithm aims to minimize the expected time until all doors open. Crucially, it must act at any time without knowing whether or which other doors have already opened. In this work, we focus on scenarios where dependencies between doors are both positively correlated and acyclic.The fundamental distribution of a door describes the probability it opens in the best of conditions (with respect to other doors being open or closed). We show that if in two configurations of $d$ doors corresponding doors share the same fundamental distribution, then these configurations have the same optimal running time up to a universal constant, no matter what are the dependencies between doors and what are the distributions. We also identify algorithms that are optimal up to a universal constant factor. For the case in which all doors share the same fundamental distribution we additionally provide a simpler algorithm, and a formula to calculate its running time. We furthermore analyse the price of lacking feedback for several configurations governed by standard fundamental distributions. In particular, we show that the price is logarithmic in $d$ for memoryless doors, but can potentially grow to be linear in $d$ for other distributions.We then turn our attention to investigate precise bounds. Even for the case of two doors, identifying the optimal sequence is an intriguing combinatorial question. Here, we study the case of two cascading memoryless doors. That is, the first door opens on each knock independently with probability $p\_1$. The second door can only open if the first door is open, in which case it will open on each knock independently with probability $p\_2$. We solve this problem almost completely by identifying algorithms that are optimal up to an additive term of 1.",0
"Efficient exploration in complex environments remains a major challenge for reinforcement learning. We propose bootstrapped DQN, a simple algorithm that explores in a computationally and statistically efficient manner through use of randomized value functions. Unlike dithering strategies such as epsilon-greedy exploration, bootstrapped DQN carries out temporally-extended (or deep) exploration; this can lead to exponentially faster learning. We demonstrate these benefits in complex stochastic MDPs and in the large-scale Arcade Learning Environment. Bootstrapped DQN substantially improves learning times and performance across most Atari games.",1
"Decision theoretical troubleshooting is about minimizing the expected cost of solving a certain problem like repairing a complicated man-made device. In this paper we consider situations where you have to take apart some of the device to get access to certain clusters and actions. Specifically, we investigate troubleshooting with independent actions in a tree of clusters where actions inside a cluster cannot be performed before the cluster is opened. The problem is non-trivial because there is a cost associated with opening and closing a cluster. Troubleshooting with independent actions and no clusters can be solved in O(n lg n) time (n being the number of actions) by the well-known ""P-over-C"" algorithm due to Kadane and Simon, but an efficient and optimal algorithm for a tree cluster model has not yet been found. In this paper we describe a ""bottom-up P-over-C"" O(n lg n) time algorithm and show that it is optimal when the clusters do not need to be closed to test whether the actions solved the problem.",0
"The noisy-or and its generalization noisy-max have been utilized to reduce the complexity of knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we present a new representation of noisy-max that allows for efficient inference in general Bayesian networks. Empirical studies show that our method is capable of computing queries in well-known large medical networks, QMR-DT and CPCS, for which no previous exact inference method has been shown to perform well.",0
"This paper presents a novel approach for automatic recognition of group activities for video surveillance applications. We propose to use a group representative to handle the recognition with a varying number of group members, and use an Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. Furthermore, we propose a group activity detection algorithm which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric group activities, and demonstrate that this approach enables the detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.",0
"The Dynamic Logic for Propositional Assignments (DL-PA) has recently been studied as an alternative to Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). In DL-PA, the abstract atomic programs of PDL are replaced by assignments of propositional variables to truth values. This makes DL-PA enjoy some interesting meta-logical properties that PDL does not, such as eliminability of the Kleene star, compactness and interpolation. We define and analytic tableaux calculus for DL-PA and show that it matches the known complexity results.",0
"We propose a cooperative coevolutionary genetic algorithm for learning Bayesian network structures from fully observable data sets. Since this problem can be decomposed into two dependent subproblems, that is to find an ordering of the nodes and an optimal connectivity matrix, our algorithm uses two subpopulations, each one representing a subtask. We describe the empirical results obtained with simulations of the Alarm and Insurance networks. We show that our algorithm outperforms the deterministic algorithm K2.",0
"One of the better studied properties for operators in judgment aggregation is independence, which essentially dictates that the collective judgment on one issue should not depend on the individual judgments given on some other issue(s) in the same agenda. Independence, although considered a desirable property, is too strong, because together with mild additional conditions it implies dictatorship. We propose here a weakening of independence, named agenda separability: a judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda is composed of several independent sub-agendas, the resulting collective judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put together. We show that this property is discriminant, in the sense that among judgment aggregation rules so far studied in the literature, some satisfy it and some do not. We briefly discuss the implications of agenda separability on the computation of judgment aggregation rules.",1
"Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming (PILP) is a rel- atively unexplored area of Statistical Relational Learning which extends classic Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This work introduces SkILL, a Stochastic Inductive Logic Learner, which takes probabilistic annotated data and produces First Order Logic theories. Data in several domains such as medicine and bioinformatics have an inherent degree of uncer- tainty, that can be used to produce models closer to reality. SkILL can not only use this type of probabilistic data to extract non-trivial knowl- edge from databases, but it also addresses efficiency issues by introducing a novel, efficient and effective search strategy to guide the search in PILP environments. The capabilities of SkILL are demonstrated in three dif- ferent datasets: (i) a synthetic toy example used to validate the system, (ii) a probabilistic adaptation of a well-known biological metabolism ap- plication, and (iii) a real world medical dataset in the breast cancer domain. Results show that SkILL can perform as well as a deterministic ILP learner, while also being able to incorporate probabilistic knowledge that would otherwise not be considered.",0
"We consider the problem of learning hierarchical policies for Reinforcement Learning able to discover options, an option corresponding to a sub-policy over a set of primitive actions. Different models have been proposed during the last decade that usually rely on a predefined set of options. We specifically address the problem of automatically discovering options in decision processes. We describe a new RL learning framework called Bi-POMDP, and a new learning model called Budgeted Option Neural Network (BONN) able to discover options based on a budgeted learning objective. Since Bi-POMDP are more general than POMDP, our model can also be used to discover options for classical RL tasks. The BONN model is evaluated on different classical RL problems, demonstrating both quantitative and qualitative interesting results.",0
"The results in this paper add useful tools to the theory of sets of desirable gambles, a growing toolbox for reasoning with partial probability assessments. We investigate how to combine a number of marginal coherent sets of desirable gambles into a joint set using the properties of epistemic irrelevance and independence. We provide formulas for the smallest such joint, called their independent natural extension, and study its main properties. The independent natural extension of maximal coherent sets of desirable gambles allows us to define the strong product of sets of desirable gambles. Finally, we explore an easy way to generalise these results to also apply for the conditional versions of epistemic irrelevance and independence. Having such a set of tools that are easily implemented in computer programs is clearly beneficial to fields, like AI, with a clear interest in coherent reasoning under uncertainty using general and robust uncertainty models that require no full specification.",0
"We present a new representation of harmonic sounds that linearizes the dynamics of pitch and spectral envelope, while remaining stable to deformations in the time-frequency plane. It is an instance of the scattering transform, a generic operator which cascades wavelet convolutions and modulus nonlinearities. It is derived from the pitch spiral, in that convolutions are successively performed in time, log-frequency, and octave index. We give a closed-form approximation of spiral scattering coefficients for a nonstationary generalization of the harmonic source-filter model.",0
"Multimedia reasoning, which is suitable for, among others, multimedia content analysis and high-level video scene interpretation, relies on the formal and comprehensive conceptualization of the represented knowledge domain. However, most multimedia ontologies are not exhaustive in terms of role definitions, and do not incorporate complex role inclusions and role interdependencies. In fact, most multimedia ontologies do not have a role box at all, and implement only a basic subset of the available logical constructors. Consequently, their application in multimedia reasoning is limited. To address the above issues, VidOnt, the very first multimedia ontology with SROIQ(D) expressivity and a DL-safe ruleset has been introduced for next-generation multimedia reasoning. In contrast to the common practice, the formal grounding has been set in one of the most expressive description logics, and the ontology validated with industry-leading reasoners, namely HermiT and FaCT++. This paper also presents best practices for developing multimedia ontologies, based on my ontology engineering approach.",0
"Sentence simplification reduces semantic complexity to benefit people with language impairments. Previous simplification studies on the sentence level and word level have achieved promising results but also meet great challenges. For sentence-level studies, sentences after simplification are fluent but sometimes are not really simplified. For word-level studies, words are simplified but also have potential grammar errors due to different usages of words before and after simplification. In this paper, we propose a two-step simplification framework by combining both the word-level and the sentence-level simplifications, making use of their corresponding advantages. Based on the two-step framework, we implement a novel constrained neural generation model to simplify sentences given simplified words. The final results on Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia aligned datasets indicate that our method yields better performance than various baselines.",0
"We give a detailed characterization of optimal trades under budget constraints in a prediction market with a cost-function-based automated market maker. We study how the budget constraints of individual traders affect their ability to impact the market price. As a concrete application of our characterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget additivity: two traders with budgets B and B' and the same beliefs would have a combined impact equal to a single trader with budget B+B'. That way, even if a single trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can have the same desired effect. When the set of payoff vectors associated with outcomes, with coordinates corresponding to securities, is affinely independent, we obtain that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic market scoring rule is budget additive, but the quadratic market scoring rule is not. Our results may be used both descriptively, to understand if a particular market maker is affected by budget constraints or not, and prescriptively, as a recipe to construct markets.",0
"We present a skill analysis with time series image data using data mining methods, focused on table tennis. We do not use body model, but use only hi-speed movies, from which time series data are obtained and analyzed using data mining methods such as C4.5 and so on. We identify internal models for technical skills as evaluation skillfulness for the forehand stroke of table tennis, and discuss mono and meta-functional skills for improving skills.",0
"A key problem of robotic environmental sensing and monitoring is that of active sensing: How can a team of robots plan the most informative observation paths to minimize the uncertainty in modeling and predicting an environmental phenomenon? This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time, even when the field conditions are less favorable.",0
"Recurrent neural networks, and in particular long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), are a remarkably effective tool for sequence modeling that learn a dense black-box hidden representation of their sequential input. Researchers interested in better understanding these models have studied the changes in hidden state representations over time and noticed some interpretable patterns but also significant noise. In this work, we present LSTMVis a visual analysis tool for recurrent neural networks with a focus on understanding these hidden state dynamics. The tool allows a user to select a hypothesis input range to focus on local state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns in a large data set, and to align these results with domain specific structural annotations. We further show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific hidden state properties on datasets containing nesting, phrase structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis.",0
"Thanks to recent advances, AI Planning has become the underlying technique for several applications. Figuring prominently among these is automated Web Service Composition (WSC) at the ""capability"" level, where services are described in terms of preconditions and effects over ontological concepts. A key issue in addressing WSC as planning is that ontologies are not only formal vocabularies; they also axiomatize the possible relationships between concepts. Such axioms correspond to what has been termed ""integrity constraints"" in the actions and change literature, and applying a web service is essentially a belief update operation. The reasoning required for belief update is known to be harder than reasoning in the ontology itself. The support for belief update is severely limited in current planning tools.",0
"This paper addresses the dynamic difficulty adjustment on MOBA games as a way to improve the player's entertainment. Although MOBA is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.",0
"In this paper, we consider the important problem of safe exploration in reinforcement learning. While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration. Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business management.",0
"Neural network based approaches for sentence relation modeling automatically generate hidden matching features from raw sentence pairs. However, the quality of matching feature representation may not be satisfied due to complex semantic relations such as entailment or contradiction. To address this challenge, we propose a new deep neural network architecture that jointly leverage pre-trained word embedding and auxiliary character embedding to learn sentence meanings. The two kinds of word sequence representations as inputs into multi-layer bidirectional LSTM to learn enhanced sentence representation. After that, we construct matching features followed by another temporal CNN to learn high-level hidden matching feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on standard evaluation datasets.",0
"Coordination of distributed agents is required for problems arising in many areas, including multi-robot systems, networking and e-commerce. As a formal framework for such problems, we use the decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP). Though much work has been done on optimal dynamic programming algorithms for the single-agent version of the problem, optimal algorithms for the multiagent case have been elusive. The main contribution of this paper is an optimal policy iteration algorithm for solving DEC-POMDPs. The algorithm uses stochastic finite-state controllers to represent policies. The solution can include a correlation device, which allows agents to correlate their actions without communicating. This approach alternates between expanding the controller and performing value-preserving transformations, which modify the controller without sacrificing value. We present two efficient value-preserving transformations: one can reduce the size of the controller and the other can improve its value while keeping the size fixed. Empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of value-preserving transformations in increasing value while keeping controller size to a minimum. To broaden the applicability of the approach, we also present a heuristic version of the policy iteration algorithm, which sacrifices convergence to optimality. This algorithm further reduces the size of the controllers at each step by assuming that probability distributions over the other agents actions are known. While this assumption may not hold in general, it helps produce higher quality solutions in our test problems.",0
"Recognition of goals and plans using incomplete evidence from action execution can be done efficiently by using planning techniques. In many applications it is important to recognize goals and plans not only accurately, but also quickly. In this paper, we develop a heuristic approach for recognizing plans based on planning techniques that rely on ordering constraints to filter candidate goals from observations. In the planning literature, these ordering constraints are called landmarks, which are facts or actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal. We show the applicability of planning landmarks in two settings: first, we use it directly to develop a heuristic-based plan recognition approach; second, we refine an existing planning-based plan recognition approach. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach is not only substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art in all available datasets, it is also an order of magnitude faster.",0
"We present the AP16-OL7 database which was released as the training and test data for the oriental language recognition (OLR) challenge on APSIPA 2016. Based on the database, a baseline system was constructed on the basis of the i-vector model. We report the baseline results evaluated in various metrics defined by the AP16-OLR evaluation plan and demonstrate that AP16-OL7 is a reasonable data resource for multilingual research.",0
"MAP is the problem of finding a most probable instantiation of a set of variables given evidence. MAP has always been perceived to be significantly harder than the related problems of computing the probability of a variable instantiation Pr, or the problem of computing the most probable explanation (MPE). This paper investigates the complexity of MAP in Bayesian networks. Specifically, we show that MAP is complete for NP^PP and provide further negative complexity results for algorithms based on variable elimination. We also show that MAP remains hard even when MPE and Pr become easy. For example, we show that MAP is NP-complete when the networks are restricted to polytrees, and even then can not be effectively approximated. Given the difficulty of computing MAP exactly, and the difficulty of approximating MAP while providing useful guarantees on the resulting approximation, we investigate best effort approximations. We introduce a generic MAP approximation framework. We provide two instantiations of the framework; one for networks which are amenable to exact inference Pr, and one for networks for which even exact inference is too hard. This allows MAP approximation on networks that are too complex to even exactly solve the easier problems, Pr and MPE. Experimental results indicate that using these approximation algorithms provides much better solutions than standard techniques, and provide accurate MAP estimates in many cases.",0
"The best currently known interactive debugging systems rely upon some meta-information in terms of fault probabilities in order to improve their efficiency. However, misleading meta information might result in a dramatic decrease of the performance and its assessment is only possible a-posteriori. Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk of suboptimal interactions. In this work we present a reinforcement learning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the performance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta information. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where reliable prior fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using diverse real-world knowledge bases, we show that the proposed interactive query strategy is scalable, features decent reaction time, and outperforms both entropy-based and no-risk strategies on average w.r.t. required amount of user interaction.",0
"We investigate a model for planning under uncertainty with temporallyextended actions, where multiple actions can be taken concurrently at each decision epoch. Our model is based on the options framework, and combines it with factored state space models,where the set of options can be partitioned into classes that affectdisjoint state variables. We show that the set of decisionepochs for concurrent options defines a semi-Markov decisionprocess, if the underlying temporally extended actions being parallelized arerestricted to Markov options. This property allows us to use SMDPalgorithms for computing the value function over concurrentoptions. The concurrent options model allows overlapping execution ofoptions in order to achieve higher performance or in order to performa complex task. We describe a simple experiment using a navigationtask which illustrates how concurrent options results in a faster planwhen compared to the case when only one option is taken at a time.",0
"Many tourist applications provide a personalized tourist agenda with the list of recommended activities to the user. These applications must undoubtedly deal with the constraints and preferences that define the user interests. Among these preferences, we can find those that define the travel style of the user, such as the rhythm of the trip, the number of visits to include in the tour or the priority to visits of special interest for the user. In this paper, we deal with the task of creating a customized tourist agenda as a planning and scheduling application capable of conveniently scheduling the most appropriate goals (visits) so as to maximize the user satisfaction with the tourist route. This paper makes an analysis of the meaning of the travel style preferences and compares the quality of the solutions obtained by two different solvers, a PDDL-based planner and a Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver. We also define several quality metrics and perform extensive experiments in order to evaluate the results obtained with both solvers.",0
"The idea of the Semantic Web is to annotate Web content and services with computer interpretable descriptions with the aim to automatize many tasks currently performed by human users. In the context of Web services, one of the most interesting tasks is their composition. In this paper we formalize this problem in the framework of a constructive description logic. In particular we propose a declarative service specification language and a calculus for service composition. We show by means of an example how this calculus can be used to define composed Web services and we discuss the problem of automatic service synthesis.",0
"One of the critical issues when adopting Bayesian networks (BNs) to model dependencies among random variables is to ""learn"" their structure, given the huge search space of possible solutions, i.e., all the possible direct acyclic graphs. This is a well-known NP-hard problem, which is also complicated by known pitfalls such as the issue of I-equivalence among different structures. In this work we restrict the investigations on BN structure learning to a specific class of networks, i.e., those representing the dynamics of phenomena characterized by the monotonic accumulation of events. Such phenomena allow to set specific structural constraints based on Suppes' theory of probabilistic causation and, accordingly, to define constrained BNs, named Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). We here investigate the structure learning of SBCNs via extensive simulations with various state-of-the-art search strategies, such as canonical local search techniques and Genetic Algorithms. Among the main results we show that Suppes' constraints deeply simplify the learning task, by reducing the solution search space and providing a temporal ordering on the variables.",0

"In light of the classic impossibility results of Arrow and Gibbard and Satterthwaite regarding voting with ordinal rules, there has been recent interest in characterizing how well common voting rules approximate the social optimum. In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space?",0
"Ubiquitous bio-sensing for personalized health monitoring is slowly becoming a reality with the increasing availability of small, diverse, robust, high fidelity sensors. This oncoming flood of data begs the question of how we will extract useful information from it. In this paper we explore the use of a variety of representations and machine learning algorithms applied to the task of seizure detection in high resolution, multichannel EEG data. We explore classification accuracy, computational complexity and memory requirements with a view toward understanding which approaches are most suitable for such tasks as the number of people involved and the amount of data they produce grows to be quite large. In particular, we show that layered learning approaches such as Deep Belief Networks excel along these dimensions.",0
"Human decisional processes result from the employment of selected quantities of relevant information, generally synthesized from environmental incoming data and stored memories. Their main goal is the production of an appropriate and adaptive response to a cognitive or behavioral task. Different strategies of response production can be adopted, among which haphazard trials, formation of mental schemes and heuristics. In this paper, we propose a model of Boolean neural network that incorporates these strategies by recurring to global optimization strategies during the learning session. The model characterizes as well the passage from an unstructured/chaotic attractor neural network typical of data-driven processes to a faster one, forward-only and representative of schema-driven processes. Moreover, a simplified version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is introduced in order to test the model. Our results match with experimental data and point out some relevant knowledge coming from psychological domain.",0
"We define two algorithms for propagating information in classification problems with pairwise relationships. The algorithms involve contraction maps and are related to non-linear diffusion and random walks on graphs. The approach is also related to message passing and mean field methods. The algorithms we describe are guaranteed to converge on graphs with arbitrary topology. Moreover they always converge to a unique fixed point, independent of initialization. We prove that the fixed points of the algorithms under consideration define lower-bounds on the energy function and the max-marginals of a Markov random field. Our theoretical results also illustrate a relationship between message passing algorithms and value iteration for an infinite horizon Markov decision process. We illustrate the practical feasibility of our algorithms with preliminary experiments in image restoration and stereo depth estimation.",0
"Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.",1

"Inspired by biological vision systems, the over-complete local features with huge cardinality are increasingly used for face recognition during the last decades. Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",0
"Usually, decision tree induction algorithms are limited to work with non relational data. Given a record, they do not take into account other objects attributes even though they can provide valuable information for the learning task. In this paper we present GGQ-ID3, a multi-relational decision tree learning algorithm that uses Generalized Graph Queries (GGQ) as predicates in the decision nodes. GGQs allow to express complex patterns (including cycles) and they can be refined step-by-step. Also, they can evaluate structures (not only single records) and perform Regular Pattern Matching. GGQ are built dynamically (pattern mining) during the GGQ-ID3 tree construction process. We will show how to use GGQ-ID3 to perform multi-relational machine learning keeping complexity under control. Finally, some real examples of automatically obtained classification trees and semantic patterns are shown.",0
"Devising an optimal strategy for navigation in a partially observable environment is one of the key objectives in AI. One of the problem in this context is the Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP). CTP is a navigation problem where an agent is tasked to travel from source to target in a partially observable weighted graph, whose edge might be blocked with a certain probability and observing such blockage occurs only when reaching upon one of the edges end points. The goal is to find a strategy that minimizes the expected travel cost. The problem is known to be P$\#$ hard. In this work we study the CTP theoretically and empirically. First, we study the Dep-CTP, a CTP variant we introduce which assumes dependencies between the edges status. We show that Dep-CTP is intractable, and further we analyze two of its subclasses on disjoint paths graph. Second, we develop a general algorithm Gen-PAO that optimally solve the CTP. Gen-PAO is capable of solving two other types of CTP called Sensing-CTP and Expensive-Edges CTP. Since the CTP is intractable, Gen-PAO use some pruning methods to reduce the space search for the optimal solution. We also define some variants of Gen-PAO, compare their performance and show some benefits of Gen-PAO over existing work.",0
"In this paper we introduce a method for extending binary qualitative direction calculi with adjustable granularity like OPRAm or the star calculus with a granular distance concept. This method is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points which are the basic entities in the OPRAm calculus. Even if the spatial objects are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference direction is attached. The same principle works also with local reference distances which are called elevations. The principle of attaching references features to a point is called hidden feature attachment.",0
"The theory $\mathsf{CDL}$ of Conditional Doxastic Logic is the single-agent version of Board's multi-agent theory $\mathsf{BRSIC}$ of conditional belief. $\mathsf{CDL}$ may be viewed as a version of AGM belief revision theory in which Boolean combinations of revisions are expressible in the language. We introduce a theory $\mathsf{JCDL}$ of Justified Conditional Doxastic Logic that replaces conditional belief formulas $B^\psi\varphi$ by expressions $t{\,:^{\psi}}\varphi$ made up of a term $t$ whose syntactic structure suggests a derivation of the belief $\varphi$ after revision by $\psi$. This allows us to think of terms $t$ as reasons justifying a belief in various formulas after a revision takes place. We show that $\mathsf{JCDL}$-theorems are the exact analogs of $\mathsf{CDL}$-theorems, and that this result holds the other way around as well. This allows us to think of $\mathsf{JCDL}$ as a theory of revisable justified belief.",0
"For robots to be accommodated in human spaces and in humans daily activities, robots should be able to understand messages from the human conversation partner. In the same light, humans must also understand the messages that are being communicated by robots, including the non-verbal ones. We conducted a web-based video study wherein participants gave interpretations on the iconic gestures and emblems that were produced by an anthropomorphic robot. Out of the 15 gestures presented, we found 6 robotic gestures that can be accurately recognized by the human observer. These were nodding, clapping, hugging, expressing anger, walking, and flying. We reviewed these gestures for their meaning from literatures in human and animal behavior. We conclude by discussing the possible implications of these gestures for the design of social robots that are aimed to have engaging interactions with humans.",0

"In some real world information fusion situations, time critical decisions must be made with an incomplete information set. Belief function theories (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been shown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the quantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete information set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a bet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs or basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one need only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical systems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe probability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to decision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above the risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the probabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that properly represents mixes of low- and high-probability events is essential. This article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an implementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs to improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller values of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability transforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the values below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC) variable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any set of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the derivations.",0
"Objective: In this paper, we develop a personalized real-time risk scoring algorithm that provides timely and granular assessments for the clinical acuity of ward patients based on their (temporal) lab tests and vital signs; the proposed risk scoring system ensures timely intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for clinically deteriorating patients. Methods: The risk scoring system learns a set of latent patient subtypes from the offline electronic health record data, and trains a mixture of Gaussian Process (GP) experts, where each expert models the physiological data streams associated with a specific patient subtype. Transfer learning techniques are used to learn the relationship between a patient's latent subtype and her static admission information (e.g. age, gender, transfer status, ICD-9 codes, etc). Results: Experiments conducted on data from a heterogeneous cohort of 6,321 patients admitted to Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center show that our risk score significantly and consistently outperforms the currently deployed risk scores, such as the Rothman index, MEWS, APACHE and SOFA scores, in terms of timeliness, true positive rate (TPR), and positive predictive value (PPV). Conclusion: Our results reflect the importance of adopting the concepts of personalized medicine in critical care settings; significant accuracy and timeliness gains can be achieved by accounting for the patients' heterogeneity. Significance: The proposed risk scoring methodology can confer huge clinical and social benefits on more than 200,000 critically ill inpatient who exhibit cardiac arrests in the US every year.",0
"Character segmentation has long been one of the most critical areas of optical character recognition process. Through this operation, an image of a sequence of characters, which may be connected in some cases, is decomposed into sub-images of individual alphabetic symbols. In this paper, segmentation of cursive handwritten script of world's fourth popular language, Bengali, is considered. Unlike English script, Bengali handwritten characters and its components often encircle the main character, making the conventional segmentation methodologies inapplicable. Experimental results, using the proposed segmentation technique, on sample cursive handwritten data containing 218 ideal segmentation points show a success rate of 97.7%. Further feature-analysis on these segments may lead to actual recognition of handwritten cursive Bengali script.",0
"Modern malware is designed with mutation characteristics, namely polymorphism and metamorphism, which causes an enormous growth in the number of variants of malware samples. Categorization of malware samples on the basis of their behaviors is essential for the computer security community in order to group samples belonging to same family. Microsoft released a malware classification challenge in 2015 with a huge dataset of near 0.5 terabytes of data, containing more than 20K malware samples. The analysis of this dataset inspired the development of a novel paradigm that is effective in categorizing malware variants into their actual family groups. This paradigm is presented and discussed in the present paper, where emphasis has been given to the phases related to the extraction, and selection of a set of novel features for the effective representation of malware samples. Features can be grouped according to different characteristics of malware behavior, and their fusion is performed according to a per-class weighting paradigm. The proposed method achieved a very high accuracy ($\approx$ 0.998) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset.",0
"Reinforcement learning tasks are typically specified as Markov decision processes. This formalism has been highly successful, though specifications often couple the dynamics of the environment and the learning objective. This lack of modularity can complicate generalization of the task specification, as well as obfuscate connections between different task settings, such as episodic and continuing. In this work, we introduce the RL task formalism, that provides a unification through simple constructs including a generalization to transition-based discounting. Through a series of examples, we demonstrate the generality and utility of this formalism. Finally, we extend standard learning constructs, including Bellman operators, and extend some seminal theoretical results, including approximation errors bounds. Overall, we provide a well-understood and sound formalism on which to build theoretical results and simplify algorithm use and development.",1
"A typical modern optimization technique is usually either heuristic or metaheuristic. This technique has managed to solve some optimization problems in the research area of science, engineering, and industry. However, implementation strategy of metaheuristic for accuracy improvement on convolution neural networks (CNN), a famous deep learning method, is still rarely investigated. Deep learning relates to a type of machine learning technique, where its aim is to move closer to the goal of artificial intelligence of creating a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual tasks that can be carried out by a human. In this paper, we propose the implementation strategy of three popular metaheuristic approaches, that is, simulated annealing, differential evolution, and harmony search, to optimize CNN. The performances of these metaheuristic methods in optimizing CNN on classifying MNIST and CIFAR dataset were evaluated and compared. Furthermore, the proposed methods are also compared with the original CNN. Although the proposed methods show an increase in the computation time, their accuracy has also been improved (up to 7.14 percent).",0
"We present a position paper advocating the notion that Stoic philosophy and ethics can inform the development of ethical A.I. systems. This is in sharp contrast to most work on building ethical A.I., which has focused on Utilitarian or Deontological ethical theories. We relate ethical A.I. to several core Stoic notions, including the dichotomy of control, the four cardinal virtues, the ideal Sage, Stoic practices, and Stoic perspectives on emotion or affect. More generally, we put forward an ethical view of A.I. that focuses more on internal states of the artificial agent rather than on external actions of the agent. We provide examples relating to near-term A.I. systems as well as hypothetical superintelligent agents.",0
"Information Retrieval (IR) is concerned with the identification of documents in a collection that are relevant to a given information need, usually represented as a query containing terms or keywords, which are supposed to be a good description of what the user is looking for. IR systems may improve their effectiveness (i.e., increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved) by using a process of query expansion, which automatically adds new terms to the original query posed by an user. In this paper we develop a method of query expansion based on Bayesian networks. Using a learning algorithm, we construct a Bayesian network that represents some of the relationships among the terms appearing in a given document collection; this network is then used as a thesaurus (specific for that collection). We also report the results obtained by our method on three standard test collections.",0
"An open problem in robotics is that of using vision to identify a robot's own body and the world around it. Many models attempt to recover the traditional C-space parameters. Instead, we propose an alternative C-space by deriving generalized coordinates from $n$ images of the robot. We show that the space of such images is bijective to the motion space, so these images lie on a manifold $\mathcal{V}$ homeomorphic to the canonical C-space. We now approximate this manifold as a set of $n$ neighbourhood tangent spaces that result in a graph, which we call the Visual Roadmap (VRM). Given a new robot image, we perform inverse kinematics visually by interpolating between nearby images in the image space. Obstacles are projected onto the VRM in $O(n)$ time by superimposition of images, leading to the identification of collision poses. The edges joining the free nodes can now be checked with a visual local planner, and free-space motions computed in $O(nlogn)$ time. This enables us to plan paths in the image space for a robot manipulator with unknown link geometries, DOF, kinematics, obstacles, and camera pose. We sketch the proofs for the main theoretical ideas, identify the assumptions, and demonstrate the approach for both articulated and mobile robots. We also investigate the feasibility of the process by investigating various metrics and image sampling densities, and demonstrate it on simulated and real robots.",0
"The goal of this project is to predict the opponent's configuration in a RoboCup SSL environment. For simplicity, a Markov model assumption is made such that the predicted formation of the opponent team only depends on its current formation. The field is divided into a grid and a robot state per player is created with information about its position and its velocity. To gather a more general sense of what the opposing team is doing, the state also incorporates the team's average position (centroid). All possible state transitions are stored in a hash table that requires minimum storage space. The table is populated with transition probabilities that are learned by reading vision packages and counting the state transitions regardless of the specific robot player. Therefore, the computation during the game is reduced to interpreting a given vision package to assign each player to a state, and looking for the most likely state it will transition to. The confidence of the predicted team's formation is the product of each individual player's probability. The project is noteworthy in that it minimizes the time and space complexity requirements for opponent's moves prediction.",0
"The efficiency of algorithms using secondary structures for probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks can be improved by exploiting independence relations induced by evidence and the direction of the links in the original network. In this paper we present an algorithm that on-line exploits independence relations induced by evidence and the direction of the links in the original network to reduce both time and space costs. Instead of multiplying the conditional probability distributions for the various cliques, we determine on-line which potentials to multiply when a message is to be produced. The performance improvement of the algorithm is emphasized through empirical evaluations involving large real world Bayesian networks, and we compare the method with the HUGIN and Shafer-Shenoy inference algorithms.",0
"The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.",0
"In this paper, we are trying to examine trade offs between fuzzy logic and certain Bayesian networks and we propose to combine their respective advantages into fuzzy certain Bayesian networks (FCBN), a certain Bayesian networks of fuzzy random variables. This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. Fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic. Within the framework proposed in this paper, we address the issue of extending the certain networks to a fuzzy certain networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge.",0
"We assess the performance of generic text summarization algorithms applied to films and documentaries, using the well-known behavior of summarization of news articles as reference. We use three datasets: (i) news articles, (ii) film scripts and subtitles, and (iii) documentary subtitles. Standard ROUGE metrics are used for comparing generated summaries against news abstracts, plot summaries, and synopses. We show that the best performing algorithms are LSA, for news articles and documentaries, and LexRank and Support Sets, for films. Despite the different nature of films and documentaries, their relative behavior is in accordance with that obtained for news articles.",0
"Choosing a good location when opening a new store is crucial for the future success of a business. Traditional methods include offline manual survey, which is very time consuming, and analytic models based on census data, which are un- able to adapt to the dynamic market. The rapid increase of the availability of big data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and offline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic and accurate data-driven prediction models for business store placement. In this paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP) framework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu Maps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and sup- ply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression models to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of businesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.",0
"Web applications form a critical component of cyber security systems as they act as a gateway for many institutions. Vulnerabilities in web applications allow malicious actors to access and/or modify restricted data. Here the hackers have the opportunity to perform reconnaissance so as to gain knowledge about the web application layout before launching an attack, whereas the defender (administrator of the web application) must secure the application even with its potential vulnerabilities. In order to mask such vulnerabilities which are primarily associated with different individual configurations, Moving Target Defense systems were proposed wherein the defender switches between various configurations thereby making it difficult to attack with success, while maintaining a seamless experience for the genuine users. However, the design of good quality switching strategies is still an open problem which is crucial for the effectiveness of the Moving Target Defense approach. In this paper, we present a way to find effective switching strategies by modeling this ecosystem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game with the administrator as the leader and the hackers as the followers, which as we show succinctly captures various aspects of the Moving Target Defense systems. Furthermore, we show how to determine which vulnerability areas should be addressed first once the system is deployed and which attacker type uncertainties should be calibrated with high precision, for increasing the security of the web application. We present experimental results on a representative web application system demonstrating the utility of switching strategies obtained using the proposed method, and we discuss various future directions that are unique to the web application domain.",0
"A new architecture and learning algorithms for the multidimensional hybrid cascade neural network with neuron pool optimization in each cascade are proposed in this paper. The proposed system differs from the well-known cascade systems in its capability to process multidimensional time series in an online mode, which makes it possible to process non-stationary stochastic and chaotic signals with the required accuracy. Compared to conventional analogs, the proposed system provides computational simplicity and possesses both tracking and filtering capabilities.",0
"While looking for abductive explanations of a given set of manifestations, an ordering between possible solutions is often assumed. The complexity of finding/verifying optimal solutions is already known. In this paper we consider the computational complexity of finding second-best solutions. We consider different orderings, and consider also different possible definitions of what a second-best solution is.",0
"In this work, a computational intelligence (CI) technique named flexible neural tree (FNT) was developed to predict die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and to identify significant die filling process variables. FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the die at different shoe speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10FCV and 5x2FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It was found that the FNT-based CI model (for both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as d50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules.",0
"The paper describes a novel approach to categorize users' reviews according to the three Quality in Use (QU) indicators defined in ISO: effectiveness, efficiency and freedom from risk. With the tremendous amount of reviews published each day, there is a need to automatically summarize user reviews to inform us if any of the software able to meet requirement of a company according to the quality requirements. We implemented the method of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and its subspace to predict QU indicators. We build a reduced dimensionality universal semantic space from Information System journals and Amazon reviews. Next, we projected set of indicators' measurement scales into the universal semantic space and represent them as subspace. In the subspace, we can map similar measurement scales to the unseen reviews and predict the QU indicators. Our preliminary study able to obtain the average of F-measure, 0.3627.",0
"Multiple different approaches of generating adversarial examples have been proposed to attack deep neural networks. These approaches involve either directly computing gradients with respect to the image pixels, or directly solving an optimization on the image pixels. In this work, we present a fundamentally new method for generating adversarial examples that is fast to execute and provides exceptional diversity of output. We efficiently train feed-forward neural networks in a self-supervised manner to generate adversarial examples against a target network or set of networks. We call such a network an Adversarial Transformation Network (ATN). ATNs are trained to generate adversarial examples that minimally modify the classifier's outputs given the original input, while constraining the new classification to match an adversarial target class. We present methods to train ATNs and analyze their effectiveness targeting a variety of MNIST classifiers as well as the latest state-of-the-art ImageNet classifier Inception ResNet v2.",0
"UCT has recently emerged as an exciting new adversarial reasoning technique based on cleverly balancing exploration and exploitation in a Monte-Carlo sampling setting. It has been particularly successful in the game of Go but the reasons for its success are not well understood and attempts to replicate its success in other domains such as Chess have failed. We provide an in-depth analysis of the potential of UCT in domain-independent settings, in cases where heuristic values are available, and the effect of enhancing random playouts to more informed playouts between two weak minimax players. To provide further insights, we develop synthetic game tree instances and discuss interesting properties of UCT, both empirically and analytically.",0
"Hypothetical Datalog is based on an intuitionistic semantics rather than on a classical logic semantics, and embedded implications are allowed in rule bodies. While the usual implication (i.e., the neck of a Horn clause) stands for inferring facts, an embedded implication plays the role of assuming its premise for deriving its consequence. A former work introduced both a formal framework and a goal-oriented tabled implementation, allowing negation in rule bodies. While in that work positive assumptions for both facts and rules can occur in the premise, negative assumptions are not allowed. In this work, we cover this subject by introducing a new concept: a restricted predicate, which allows negative assumptions by pruning the usual semantics of a predicate. This new setting has been implemented in the deductive system DES.",0
"We propose a new approach for solving combinatorial optimization problem by utilizing the mechanism of chases and escapes, which has a long history in mathematics. In addition to the well-used steepest descent and neighboring search, we perform a chase and escape game on the ""landscape"" of the cost function. We have created a concrete algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Our preliminary test indicates a possibility that this new fusion of chases and escapes problem into combinatorial optimization search is fruitful.",0
Influence diagrams are decision theoretic extensions of Bayesian networks. They are applied to diverse decision problems. In this paper we apply influence diagrams to the optimization of a vehicle speed profile. We present results of computational experiments in which an influence diagram was used to optimize the speed profile of a Formula 1 race car at the Silverstone F1 circuit. The computed lap time and speed profiles correspond well to those achieved by test pilots. An extended version of our model that considers a more complex optimization function and diverse traffic constraints is currently being tested onboard a testing car by a major car manufacturer. This paper opens doors for new applications of influence diagrams.,0
"Tensor factorization is an important approach to multiway data analysis. Compared with popular multilinear methods, nonlinear tensor factorization models are able to capture more complex relationships in data. However, they are computationally expensive and incapable of exploiting the data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new tensor factorization model. The model employs a Gaussian process (GP) to capture the complex nonlinear relationships. The GP can be projected to arbitrary sets of tensor elements, and thus can avoid the expensive computation of the Kronecker product and is able to flexibly incorporate meaningful entries for training. Furthermore, to scale up the model to large data, we develop a distributed variational inference algorithm in MapReduce framework. To this end, we derive a tractable and tight variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) that enables efficient parallel computations and high quality inferences. In addition, we design a non-key-value Map-Reduce scheme that can prevent the costly data shuffling and fully use the memory-cache mechanism in fast MapReduce systems such as SPARK. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches in terms of both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Moreover, our approach shows a promising potential in the application of Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction for online advertising.",1
"Stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms have exhibited great effectiveness in finding models of random instances of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). As one of the most widely known and used SLS algorithm,WalkSAT plays a key role in the evolutions of SLS for SAT, and also hold state-ofthe- art performance on random instances. This work proposes a novel implementation forWalkSAT which decreases the redundant calculations leading to a dramatically speeding up, thus dominates the latest version of WalkSAT including its advanced variants.",0
"Recent work on loglinear models in probabilistic constraint logic programming is applied to first-order probabilistic reasoning. Probabilities are defined directly on the proofs of atomic formulae, and by marginalisation on the atomic formulae themselves. We use Stochastic Logic Programs (SLPs) composed of labelled and unlabelled definite clauses to define the proof probabilities. We have a conservative extension of first-order reasoning, so that, for example, there is a one-one mapping between logical and random variables. We show how, in this framework, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to induce the features of a loglinear model from data. We also compare the presented framework with other approaches to first-order probabilistic reasoning.",0
"This paper introduces a computational framework for reasoning in Bayesian belief networks that derives significant advantages from focused inference and relevance reasoning. This framework is based on d -separation and other simple and computationally efficient techniques for pruning irrelevant parts of a network. Our main contribution is a technique that we call relevance-based decomposition. Relevance-based decomposition approaches belief updating in large networks by focusing on their parts and decomposing them into partially overlapping subnetworks. This makes reasoning in some intractable networks possible and, in addition, often results in significant speedup, as the total time taken to update all subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the time taken to update the network as a whole. We report results of empirical tests that demonstrate practical significance of our approach.",0
"Extensional higher-order logic programming has been introduced as a generalization of classical logic programming. An important characteristic of this paradigm is that it preserves all the well-known properties of traditional logic programming. In this paper we consider the semantics of negation in the context of the new paradigm. Using some recent results from non-monotonic fixed-point theory, we demonstrate that every higher-order logic program with negation has a unique minimum infinite-valued model. In this way we obtain the first purely model-theoretic semantics for negation in extensional higher-order logic programming. Using our approach, we resolve an old paradox that was introduced by W. W. Wadge in order to demonstrate the semantic difficulties of higher-order logic programming.",0
"The semantics for counterfactuals due to David Lewis has been challenged on the basis of unlikely, or impossible, events. Such events may skew a given similarity order in favour of those possible worlds which exhibit them. By updating the relational structure of a model according to a ceteris paribus clause one forces out, in a natural manner, those possible worlds which do not satisfy the requirements of the clause. We develop a ceteris paribus logic for counterfactual reasoning capable of performing such actions, and offer several alternative (relaxed) interpretations of ceteris paribus. We apply this framework in a way which allows us to reason counterfactually without having our similarity order skewed by unlikely events. This continues the investigation of formal ceteris paribus reasoning, which has previously been applied to preferences, logics of game forms, and questions in decision-making, among other areas.",0
"Epistemic planning can be used for decision making in multi-agent situations with distributed knowledge and capabilities. Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for epistemic planning. In this paper, we aim to give an accessible introduction to DEL-based epistemic planning. The paper starts with the most classical framework for planning, STRIPS, and then moves towards epistemic planning in a number of smaller steps, where each step is motivated by the need to be able to model more complex planning scenarios.",0
"We consider the problem of learning for planning, where knowledge acquired while planning is reused to plan faster in new problem instances. For robotic tasks, among others, plan execution can be captured as a sequence of visual images. For such domains, we propose to use deep neural networks in learning for planning, based on learning a reactive policy that imitates execution traces produced by a planner. We investigate architectural properties of deep networks that are suitable for learning long-horizon planning behavior, and explore how to learn, in addition to the policy, a heuristic function that can be used with classical planners or search algorithms such as A*. Our results on the challenging Sokoban domain show that, with a suitable network design, complex decision making policies and powerful heuristic functions can be learned through imitation.",0
"In recent years Bayesian networks (BNs) with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables have received an increasing level of attention. We present an architecture for exact belief update in Conditional Linear Gaussian BNs (CLG BNs). The architecture is an extension of lazy propagation using operations of Lauritzen &amp; Jensen [6] and Cowell [2]. By decomposing clique and separator potentials into sets of factors, the proposed architecture takes advantage of independence and irrelevance properties induced by the structure of the graph and the evidence. The resulting benefits are illustrated by examples. Results of a preliminary empirical performance evaluation indicate a significant potential of the proposed architecture.",0
"Given a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions per state, we study the number of iterations needed by Policy Iteratio n (PI) algorithms to converge. We consider two variations of PI: Howard's PI that changes all the actions with a positive advantage, and Sim plex-PI that only changes one action with maximal advantage. We show that Howard's PI terminates after at most $ n(m-1) \lceil \frac{1}{1-\gamma}\log (\frac{1}{1-\gamma}) \rceil $ iterations, improving by a factor $O(\log n)$ a result by Hansen et al. (2013), while Simplex-PI terminates after at most $ n(m-1) \lceil \frac{n}{1-\gamma} \log (\frac{n}{1-\gamma})\rceil $ iterations, improving by a factor 2 a result by Ye (2011). We then consider bounds that are independent of the discount factor $\gamma$. When the MDP is deterministic, we show that Simplex-PI terminates after at most $ 2 n^2 m (m-1) \lceil 2 (n-1) \log n \rceil \lceil 2 n \log n \rceil = O(n^4 m^2 \log^2 n) $ iterations, improving by a factor $O(n)$ a bound obtained by Post and Ye (2012). We generalize this result to general MDPs under some structural assumptions: given a measure of the maximal transient time $\tau_t$ and the maximal time $\tau_r$ to revisit states in recurrent classes under all policies, we show that Simplex-PI terminates after at most $ n^2 m (m-1) (\lceil \tau_r \log (n \tau_r) \rceil +\lceil \tau_r \log (n \tau_t) \rceil) \lceil {\tau_t} \log (n (\tau_t+1)) \rceil = \tilde O (n^2 \tau_t \tau_r m^2) $ iterations. We explain why similar results seem hard to derive for Howard's PI. Finally, under the additional (restrictive) assumption that the MDP is weakly-communicating, we show that Simplex-PI and Howard's PI terminate after at most $n(m-1) (\lceil \tau_t \log n \tau_t \rceil + \lceil \tau_r \log n \tau_r \rceil) =\tilde O(nm (\tau_t+\tau_r))$ iterations.",1
"In this paper we introduce a knowledge engine, which learns and shares knowledge representations, for robots to carry out a variety of tasks. Building such an engine brings with it the challenge of dealing with multiple data modalities including symbols, natural language, haptic senses, robot trajectories, visual features and many others. The knowledge stored in the engine comes from multiple sources including physical interactions that robots have while performing tasks (perception, planning and control), knowledge bases from WWW and learned representations from leading robotics research groups.",0
"In multi-agent domains (MADs), an agent's action may not just change the world and the agent's knowledge and beliefs about the world, but also may change other agents' knowledge and beliefs about the world and their knowledge and beliefs about other agents' knowledge and beliefs about the world. The goals of an agent in a multi-agent world may involve manipulating the knowledge and beliefs of other agents' and again, not just their knowledge/belief about the world, but also their knowledge about other agents' knowledge about the world. Our goal is to present an action language (mA+) that has the necessary features to address the above aspects in representing and RAC in MADs. mA+ allows the representation of and reasoning about different types of actions that an agent can perform in a domain where many other agents might be present---such as world-altering actions, sensing actions, and announcement/communication actions. It also allows the specification of agents' dynamic awareness of action occurrences which has future implications on what agents' know about the world and other agents' knowledge about the world. mA+ considers three different types of awareness: full,- partial- awareness, and complete oblivion of an action occurrence and its effects. This keeps the language simple, yet powerful enough to address a large variety of knowledge manipulation scenarios in MADs. The semantics of mA+ relies on the notion of state, which is described by a pointed Kripke model and is used to encode the agent's knowledge and the real state of the world. It is defined by a transition function that maps pairs of actions and states into sets of states. We illustrate properties of the action theories, including properties that guarantee finiteness of the set of initial states and their practical implementability. Finally, we relate mA+ to other related formalisms that contribute to RAC in MADs.",0
"We introduce second-order vector representations of words, induced from nearest neighborhood topological features in pre-trained contextual word embeddings. We then analyze the effects of using second-order embeddings as input features in two deep natural language processing models, for named entity recognition and recognizing textual entailment, as well as a linear model for paraphrase recognition. Surprisingly, we find that nearest neighbor information alone is sufficient to capture most of the performance benefits derived from using pre-trained word embeddings. Furthermore, second-order embeddings are able to handle highly heterogeneous data better than first-order representations, though at the cost of some specificity. Additionally, augmenting contextual embeddings with second-order information further improves model performance in some cases. Due to variance in the random initializations of word embeddings, utilizing nearest neighbor features from multiple first-order embedding samples can also contribute to downstream performance gains. Finally, we identify intriguing characteristics of second-order embedding spaces for further research, including much higher density and different semantic interpretations of cosine similarity.",0
"We consider a multilingual weakly supervised learning scenario where knowledge from annotated corpora in a resource-rich language is transferred via bitext to guide the learning in other languages. Past approaches project labels across bitext and use them as features or gold labels for training. We propose a new method that projects model expectations rather than labels, which facilities transfer of model uncertainty across language boundaries. We encode expectations as constraints and train a discriminative CRF model using Generalized Expectation Criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010). Evaluated on standard Chinese-English and German-English NER datasets, our method demonstrates F1 scores of 64% and 60% when no labeled data is used. Attaining the same accuracy with supervised CRFs requires 12k and 1.5k labeled sentences. Furthermore, when combined with labeled examples, our method yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art supervised methods, achieving best reported numbers to date on Chinese OntoNotes and German CoNLL-03 datasets.",1
"The transcription of handwritten text on images is one task in machine learning and one solution to solve it is using multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNN) with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). The RNNs can contain special units, the long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. They are able to learn long term dependencies but they get unstable when the dimension is chosen greater than one. We defined some useful and necessary properties for the one-dimensional LSTM cell and extend them in the multi-dimensional case. Thereby we introduce several new cells with better stability. We present a method to design cells using the theory of linear shift invariant systems. The new cells are compared to the LSTM cell on the IFN/ENIT and Rimes database, where we can improve the recognition rate compared to the LSTM cell. So each application where the LSTM cells in MDRNNs are used could be improved by substituting them by the new developed cells.",0
"We show how to estimate a model's test error from unlabeled data, on distributions very different from the training distribution, while assuming only that certain conditional independencies are preserved between train and test. We do not need to assume that the optimal predictor is the same between train and test, or that the true distribution lies in any parametric family. We can also efficiently differentiate the error estimate to perform unsupervised discriminative learning. Our technical tool is the method of moments, which allows us to exploit conditional independencies in the absence of a fully-specified model. Our framework encompasses a large family of losses including the log and exponential loss, and extends to structured output settings such as hidden Markov models.",1
"In this paper, we study three connection games among the most widely played: Havannah, Twixt, and Slither. We show that determining the outcome of an arbitrary input position is PSPACE-complete in all three cases. Our reductions are based on the popular graph problem Generalized Geography and on Hex itself. We also consider the complexity of generalizations of Hex parameterized by the length of the solution and establish that while Short Generalized Hex is W[1]-hard, Short Hex is FPT. Finally, we prove that the ultra-weak solution to the empty starting position in hex cannot be fully adapted to any of these three games.",0
"There are many goals for an AI that could become dangerous if the AI becomes superintelligent or otherwise powerful. Much work on the AI control problem has been focused on constructing AI goals that are safe even for such AIs. This paper looks at an alternative approach: defining a general concept of `low impact'. The aim is to ensure that a powerful AI which implements low impact will not modify the world extensively, even if it is given a simple or dangerous goal. The paper proposes various ways of defining and grounding low impact, and discusses methods for ensuring that the AI can still be allowed to have a (desired) impact despite the restriction. The end of the paper addresses known issues with this approach and avenues for future research.",0
"Possibilistic logic bases and possibilistic graphs are two different frameworks of interest for representing knowledge. The former stratifies the pieces of knowledge (expressed by logical formulas) according to their level of certainty, while the latter exhibits relationships between variables. The two types of representations are semantically equivalent when they lead to the same possibility distribution (which rank-orders the possible interpretations). A possibility distribution can be decomposed using a chain rule which may be based on two different kinds of conditioning which exist in possibility theory (one based on product in a numerical setting, one based on minimum operation in a qualitative setting). These two types of conditioning induce two kinds of possibilistic graphs. In both cases, a translation of these graphs into possibilistic bases is provided. The converse translation from a possibilistic knowledge base into a min-based graph is also described.",0
"The global influence of Big Data is not only growing but seemingly endless. The trend is leaning towards knowledge that is attained easily and quickly from massive pools of Big Data. Today we are living in the technological world that Dr. Usama Fayyad and his distinguished research fellows discussed in the introductory explanations of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) predicted nearly two decades ago. Indeed, they were precise in their outlook on Big Data analytics. In fact, the continued improvement of the interoperability of machine learning, statistics, database building and querying fused to create this increasingly popular science- Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery. The next generation computational theories are geared towards helping to extract insightful knowledge from even larger volumes of data at higher rates of speed. As the trend increases in popularity, the need for a highly adaptive solution for knowledge discovery will be necessary. In this research paper, we are introducing the investigation and development of 23 bit-questions for a Metaknowledge template for Big Data Processing and clustering purposes. This research aims to demonstrate the construction of this methodology and proves the validity and the beneficial utilization that brings Knowledge Discovery from Big Data.",0
"Can we develop a computer algorithm that assesses the creativity of a painting given its context within art history? This paper proposes a novel computational framework for assessing the creativity of creative products, such as paintings, sculptures, poetry, etc. We use the most common definition of creativity, which emphasizes the originality of the product and its influential value. The proposed computational framework is based on constructing a network between creative products and using this network to infer about the originality and influence of its nodes. Through a series of transformations, we construct a Creativity Implication Network. We show that inference about creativity in this network reduces to a variant of network centrality problems which can be solved efficiently. We apply the proposed framework to the task of quantifying creativity of paintings (and sculptures). We experimented on two datasets with over 62K paintings to illustrate the behavior of the proposed framework. We also propose a methodology for quantitatively validating the results of the proposed algorithm, which we call the ""time machine experiment"".",0
"We propose a logical/mathematical framework for statistical parameter learning of parameterized logic programs, i.e. definite clause programs containing probabilistic facts with a parameterized distribution. It extends the traditional least Herbrand model semantics in logic programming to distribution semantics, possible world semantics with a probability distribution which is unconditionally applicable to arbitrary logic programs including ones for HMMs, PCFGs and Bayesian networks. We also propose a new EM algorithm, the graphical EM algorithm, that runs for a class of parameterized logic programs representing sequential decision processes where each decision is exclusive and independent. It runs on a new data structure called support graphs describing the logical relationship between observations and their explanations, and learns parameters by computing inside and outside probability generalized for logic programs. The complexity analysis shows that when combined with OLDT search for all explanations for observations, the graphical EM algorithm, despite its generality, has the same time complexity as existing EM algorithms, i.e. the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs, the Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFGs, and the one for singly connected Bayesian networks that have been developed independently in each research field. Learning experiments with PCFGs using two corpora of moderate size indicate that the graphical EM algorithm can significantly outperform the Inside-Outside algorithm.",0
"A sequence of random variables is exchangeable if its joint distribution is invariant under variable permutations. We introduce exchangeable variable models (EVMs) as a novel class of probabilistic models whose basic building blocks are partially exchangeable sequences, a generalization of exchangeable sequences. We prove that a family of tractable EVMs is optimal under zero-one loss for a large class of functions, including parity and threshold functions, and strictly subsumes existing tractable independence-based model families. Extensive experiments show that EVMs outperform state of the art classifiers such as SVMs and probabilistic models which are solely based on independence assumptions.",1
"With applications to many disciplines, the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classical computer science optimization problem with applications to industrial engineering, theoretical computer science, bioinformatics, and several other disciplines. In recent years, there have been a plethora of novel approaches for approximate solutions ranging from simplistic greedy to cooperative distributed algorithms derived from artificial intelligence. In this paper, we perform an evaluation and analysis of cornerstone algorithms for the Euclidean TSP. We evaluate greedy, 2-opt, and genetic algorithms. We use several datasets as input for the algorithms including a small dataset, a mediumsized dataset representing cities in the United States, and a synthetic dataset consisting of 200 cities to test algorithm scalability. We discover that the greedy and 2-opt algorithms efficiently calculate solutions for smaller datasets. Genetic algorithm has the best performance for optimality for medium to large datasets, but generally have longer runtime. Our implementations is public available.",0
"This paper describes the analysis of a selected testbed of Semantic Web ontologies, by a SPARQL query, which determines those ontologies that can be related to the description logic DL&lt;ForAllPiZero&gt;, introduced in [4] and studied in [9]. We will see that a reasonable number of them is expressible within such computationally efficient language. We expect that, in a long-term view, a temporalization of description logics, and consequently, of OWL(2), can open new perspectives for the inclusion in this language of a greater number of ontologies of the testbed and, hopefully, of the ""real world"".",0
"This paper investigates the connections between two state of the art classifiers: decision forests (DFs, including decision jungles) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Decision forests are computationally efficient thanks to their conditional computation property (computation is confined to only a small region of the tree, the nodes along a single branch). CNNs achieve state of the art accuracy, thanks to their representation learning capabilities. We present a systematic analysis of how to fuse conditional computation with representation learning and achieve a continuum of hybrid models with different ratios of accuracy vs. efficiency. We call this new family of hybrid models conditional networks. Conditional networks can be thought of as: i) decision trees augmented with data transformation operators, or ii) CNNs, with block-diagonal sparse weight matrices, and explicit data routing functions. Experimental validation is performed on the common task of image classification on both the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Compared to state of the art CNNs, our hybrid models yield the same accuracy with a fraction of the compute cost and much smaller number of parameters.",0

"In recent years research in the planning community has moved increasingly toward s application of planners to realistic problems involving both time and many typ es of resources. For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover ex ploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application. The International Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002) set the planning community the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources. This necessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition. We describe the syntax of the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power --- exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology --- and presents a number of important challenges to the research community.",0
We present examples where the use of belief functions provided sound and elegant solutions to real life problems. These are essentially characterized by ?missing' information. The examples deal with 1) discriminant analysis using a learning set where classes are only partially known; 2) an information retrieval systems handling inter-documents relationships; 3) the combination of data from sensors competent on partially overlapping frames; 4) the determination of the number of sources in a multi-sensor environment by studying the inter-sensors contradiction. The purpose of the paper is to report on such applications where the use of belief functions provides a convenient tool to handle ?messy' data problems.,0
"In an open, constantly changing and collaborative environment like the forthcoming Semantic Web, it is reasonable to expect that knowledge sources will contain noise and inaccuracies. It is well known, as the logical foundation of the Semantic Web, description logic is lack of the ability of tolerating inconsistent or incomplete data. Recently, the ability of paraconsistent approaches in Semantic Web is weaker in this paper, we present a tableau algorithm based on sign transformation in Semantic Web which holds the stronger ability of reasoning. We prove that the tableau algorithm is decidable which hold the same function of classical tableau algorithm for consistent knowledge bases.",0
"Although the usefulness of belief networks for reasoning under uncertainty is widely accepted, obtaining numerical probabilities that they require is still perceived a major obstacle. Often not enough statistical data is available to allow for reliable probability estimation. Available information may not be directly amenable for encoding in the network. Finally, domain experts may be reluctant to provide numerical probabilities. In this paper, we propose a method for elicitation of probabilities from a domain expert that is non-invasive and accommodates whatever probabilistic information the expert is willing to state. We express all available information, whether qualitative or quantitative in nature, in a canonical form consisting of (in) equalities expressing constraints on the hyperspace of possible joint probability distributions. We then use this canonical form to derive second-order probability distributions over the desired probabilities.",0
"The CDCL algorithm is the leading solution adopted by state-of-the-art solvers for SAT, SMT, ASP, and others. Experiments show that the performance of CDCL solvers can be significantly boosted by embedding domain-specific heuristics, especially on large real-world problems. However, a proper integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf CDCL implementations is not obvious. In this paper, we distill the key ingredients that drive the search of CDCL solvers, and propose a general framework for designing and implementing new heuristics. We implemented our strategy in an ASP solver, and we experimented on two industrial domains. On hard problem instances, state-of-the-art implementations fail to find any solution in acceptable time, whereas our implementation is very successful and finds all solutions.",0
"In current perception systems applied to the rebuilding of the environment for intelligent vehicles, the part reserved to object association for the tracking is increasingly significant. This allows firstly to follow the objects temporal evolution and secondly to increase the reliability of environment perception. We propose in this communication the development of a multi-objects association algorithm with ambiguity removal entering into the design of such a dynamic perception system for intelligent vehicles. This algorithm uses the belief theory and data modelling with fuzzy mathematics in order to be able to handle inaccurate as well as uncertain information due to imperfect sensors. These theories also allow the fusion of numerical as well as symbolic data. We develop in this article the problem of matching between known and perceived objects. This makes it possible to update a dynamic environment map for a vehicle. The belief theory will enable us to quantify the belief in the association of each perceived object with each known object. Conflicts can appear in the case of object appearance or disappearance, or in the case of a confused situation or bad perception. These conflicts are removed or solved using an assignment algorithm, giving a solution called the "" best "" and so ensuring the tracking of some objects present in our environment.",0
"A Bayesian Belief Network (BN) is a model of a joint distribution over a setof n variables, with a DAG structure to represent the immediate dependenciesbetween the variables, and a set of parameters (aka CPTables) to represent thelocal conditional probabilities of a node, given each assignment to itsparents. In many situations, these parameters are themselves random variables - this may reflect the uncertainty of the domain expert, or may come from atraining sample used to estimate the parameter values. The distribution overthese ""CPtable variables"" induces a distribution over the response the BNwill return to any ""What is Pr(H | E)?"" query. This paper investigates thevariance of this response, showing first that it is asymptotically normal,then providing its mean and asymptotical variance. We then present aneffective general algorithm for computing this variance, which has the samecomplexity as simply computing the (mean value of) the response itself - ie,O(n 2^w), where n is the number of variables and w is the effective treewidth. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that this algorithm, whichincorporates assumptions and approximations, works effectively in practice,given only small samples.",0
"We study a problem of allocating divisible jobs, arriving online, to workers in a crowdsourcing setting which involves learning two parameters of strategically behaving workers. Each job is split into a certain number of tasks that are then allocated to workers. Each arriving job has to be completed within a deadline and each task has to be completed satisfying an upper bound on probability of failure. The job population is homogeneous while the workers are heterogeneous in terms of costs, completion times, and times to failure. The job completion time and time to failure of each worker are stochastic with fixed but unknown means. The requester is faced with the challenge of learning two separate parameters of each (strategically behaving) worker simultaneously, namely, the mean job completion time and the mean time to failure. The time to failure of a worker depends on the duration of the task handled by the worker. Assuming non-strategic workers to start with, we solve this biparameter learning problem by applying the Robust UCB algorithm. Then, we non-trivially extend this algorithm to the setting where the workers are strategic about their costs. Our proposed mechanism is dominant strategy incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational with asymptotically optimal regret performance.",0
"We present ABA+, a new approach to handling preferences in a well known structured argumentation formalism, Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA). In ABA+, preference information given over assumptions is incorporated directly into the attack relation, thus resulting in attack reversal. ABA+ conservatively extends ABA and exhibits various desirable features regarding relationship among argumentation semantics as well as preference handling. We also introduce Weak Contraposition, a principle concerning reasoning with rules and preferences that relaxes the standard principle of contraposition, while guaranteeing additional desirable features for ABA+.",0
"T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) is a popular and prize-winning approach for dimensionality reduction and visualizing high-dimensional data. However, tSNE is non-parametric: once visualization is built, tSNE is not designed to incorporate additional data into existing representation. It highly limits the applicability of tSNE to the scenarios where data are added or updated over time (like dashboards or series of data snapshots).",0
"A new distance function dist(A,B) for fuzzy sets A and B is introduced. It is based on the descriptive complexity, i.e., the number of bits (on average) that are needed to describe an element in the symmetric difference of the two sets. The distance gives the amount of additional information needed to describe any one of the two sets given the other. We prove its mathematical properties and perform pattern clustering on data based on this distance.",0
"We introduce T-LESS, a new public dataset for estimating the 6D pose, i.e. translation and rotation, of texture-less rigid objects. The dataset features thirty industry-relevant objects with no significant texture and no discriminative color or reflectance properties. The objects exhibit symmetries and mutual similarities in shape and/or size. Compared to other datasets, a unique property is that some of the objects are parts of others. The dataset includes training and test images that were captured with three synchronized sensors, specifically a structured-light and a time-of-flight RGB-D sensor and a high-resolution RGB camera. There are approximately 39K training and 10K test images from each sensor. Additionally, two types of 3D models are provided for each object, i.e. a manually created CAD model and a semi-automatically reconstructed one. Training images depict individual objects against a black background. Test images originate from twenty test scenes having varying complexity, which increases from simple scenes with several isolated objects to very challenging ones with multiple instances of several objects and with a high amount of clutter and occlusion. The images were captured from a systematically sampled view sphere around the object/scene, and are annotated with accurate ground truth 6D poses of all modeled objects. Initial evaluation results indicate that the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation has ample room for improvement, especially in difficult cases with significant occlusion. The T-LESS dataset is available online at cmp.felk.cvut.cz/t-less.",0
"This paper presents a powerful genetic algorithm(GA) to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). To construct a powerful GA, I use edge swapping(ES) with a local search procedure to determine good combinations of building blocks of parent solutions for generating even better offspring solutions. Experimental results on well studied TSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GA is competitive in finding very high quality solutions on instances with up to 16,862 cities.",0
"The compatibility of quantitative and qualitative representations of beliefs was studied extensively in probability theory. It is only recently that this important topic is considered in the context of belief functions. In this paper, the compatibility of various quantitative belief measures and qualitative belief structures is investigated. Four classes of belief measures considered are: the probability function, the monotonic belief function, Shafer's belief function, and Smets' generalized belief function. The analysis of their individual compatibility with different belief structures not only provides a sound b&lt;msis for these quantitative measures, but also alleviates some of the difficulties in the acquisition and interpretation of numeric belief numbers. It is shown that the structure of qualitative probability is compatible with monotonic belief functions. Moreover, a belief structure slightly weaker than that of qualitative belief is compatible with Smets' generalized belief functions.",0
"In Dung's abstract argumentation, arguments are either acceptable or unacceptable, given a chosen notion of acceptability. This gives a coarse way to compare arguments. In this paper, we propose a counting approach for a more fine-gained assessment to arguments by counting the number of their respective attackers and defenders based on argument graph and argument game. An argument is more acceptable if the proponent puts forward more number of defenders for it and the opponent puts forward less number of attackers against it. We show that our counting model has two well-behaved properties: normalization and convergence. Then, we define a counting semantics based on this model, and investigate some general properties of the semantics.",0
"As computational agents are developed for increasingly complicated e-commerce applications, the complexity of the decisions they face demands advances in artificial intelligence techniques. For example, an agent representing a seller in an auction should try to maximize the seller's profit by reasoning about a variety of possibly uncertain pieces of information, such as the maximum prices various buyers might be willing to pay, the possible prices being offered by competing sellers, the rules by which the auction operates, the dynamic arrival and matching of offers to buy and sell, and so on. A naive application of multiagent reasoning techniques would require the seller's agent to explicitly model all of the other agents through an extended time horizon, rendering the problem intractable for many realistically-sized problems. We have instead devised a new strategy that an agent can use to determine its bid price based on a more tractable Markov chain model of the auction process. We have experimentally identified the conditions under which our new strategy works well, as well as how well it works in comparison to the optimal performance the agent could have achieved had it known the future. Our results show that our new strategy in general performs well, outperforming other tractable heuristic strategies in a majority of experiments, and is particularly effective in a 'seller?s market', where many buy offers are available.",0
"Binary decisions are very common in artificial intelligence. Applying a threshold on the continuous score gives the human decider the power to control the operating point to separate the two classes. The classifier,s discriminating power is measured along the continuous range of the score by the Area Under the ROC curve (AUC_ROC) in most application fields. Only finances uses the poor single point metric maximum Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance. This paper proposes the Area Under the KS curve (AUC_KS) for performance assessment and proves AUC_ROC = 0.5 + AUC_KS, as a simpler way to calculate the AUC_ROC. That is even more important for ROC averaging in ensembles of classifiers or n fold cross-validation. The proof is geometrically inspired on rotating all KS curve to make it lie on the top of the ROC chance diagonal. On the practical side, the independent variable on the abscissa on the KS curve simplifies the calculation of the AUC_ROC. On the theoretical side, this research gives insights on probabilistic interpretations of classifiers assessment and integrates the existing body of knowledge of the information theoretical ROC approach with the proposed statistical approach based on the thoroughly known KS distribution.",0
"Given an argumentation network with initial values to the arguments, we look for algorithms which can yield extensions compatible with such initial values. We find that the best way of tackling this problem is to offer an iteration formula that takes the initial values and the attack relation and iterates a sequence of intermediate values that eventually converges leading to an extension. The properties surrounding the application of the iteration formula and its connection with other numerical and non-numerical techniques proposed by others are thoroughly investigated in this paper.",0
"We have previously reported a Bayesian algorithm for determining the coordinates of points in three-dimensional space from uncertain constraints. This method is useful in the determination of biological molecular structure. It is limited, however, by the requirement that the uncertainty in the constraints be normally distributed. In this paper, we present an extension of the original algorithm that allows constraint uncertainty to be represented as a mixture of Gaussians, and thereby allows arbitrary constraint distributions. We illustrate the performance of this algorithm on a problem drawn from the domain of molecular structure determination, in which a multicomponent constraint representation produces a much more accurate solution than the old single component mechanism. The new mechanism uses mixture distributions to decompose the problem into a set of independent problems with unimodal constraint uncertainty. The results of the unimodal subproblems are periodically recombined using Bayes' law, to avoid combinatorial explosion. The new algorithm is particularly suited for parallel implementation.",0
"Fuzzy logic is an alternate approach for quantifying uncertainty relating to activity duration. The fuzzy version of the backward recursion has been shown to produce results that incorrectly amplify the level of uncertainty. However, the fuzzy version of the forward recursion has been widely proposed as an approach for determining the fuzzy set of critical path lengths. In this paper, the direct application of the extension principle leads to a proposition that must be satisfied in fuzzy critical path analysis. Using a counterexample it is demonstrated that the fuzzy forward recursion when discrete fuzzy sets are used to represent activity durations produces results that are not consistent with the theory presented. The problem is shown to be the application of the fuzzy maximum. Several methods presented in the literature are described and shown to provide results that are consistent with the extension principle.",0
"DL-Lite is an important family of description logics. Recently, there is an increasing interest in handling inconsistency in DL-Lite as the constraint imposed by a TBox can be easily violated by assertions in ABox in DL-Lite. In this paper, we present a distance-based paraconsistent semantics based on the notion of feature in DL-Lite, which provides a novel way to rationally draw meaningful conclusions even from an inconsistent knowledge base. Finally, we investigate several important logical properties of this entailment relation based on the new semantics and show its promising advantages in non-monotonic reasoning for DL-Lite.",0
"In the context of Building Information Modelling, ontologies have been identified as interesting in achieving information interoperability. Regarding the construction and facility management domains, several IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) based ontologies have been developed, such as IfcOWL. In the context of ontology modelling, the constraint of optimizing the size of IFC STEP-based files can be leveraged. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the IFC model into OWL which leverages from all modelling constraints required by the object-oriented structure of IFC schema. Therefore, we do not only present a syntactic but also a semantic adaptation of the IFC model. Our model takes into consideration the meaning of entities, relationships, properties and attributes defined by the IFC standard. Our approach presents several advantages compared to other initiatives such as the optimization of query execution time. Every advantage is defended by means of practical examples and benchmarks.",0
"Given a CNF formula and a weight for each assignment of values to variables, two natural problems are weighted model counting and distribution-aware sampling of satisfying assignments. Both problems have a wide variety of important applications. Due to the inherent complexity of the exact versions of the problems, interest has focused on solving them approximately. Prior work in this area scaled only to small problems in practice, or failed to provide strong theoretical guarantees, or employed a computationally-expensive maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) oracle that assumes prior knowledge of a factored representation of the weight distribution. We present a novel approach that works with a black-box oracle for weights of assignments and requires only an {\NP}-oracle (in practice, a SAT-solver) to solve both the counting and sampling problems. Our approach works under mild assumptions on the distribution of weights of satisfying assignments, provides strong theoretical guarantees, and scales to problems involving several thousand variables. We also show that the assumptions can be significantly relaxed while improving computational efficiency if a factored representation of the weights is known.",1
"This paper presents a fuzzy inference system for integrated volt/var control (VVC) in distribution substations. The purpose is go forward to automation distribution applying conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in isolated power systems where control capabilities are limited. A fuzzy controller has been designed. Working as an on-line tool, it has been tested under real conditions and it has managed the operation during a whole day in a distribution substation. Within the limits of control capabilities of the system, the controller maintained successfully an acceptable voltage profile, power factor values over 0,98 and it has ostensibly improved the performance given by an optimal power flow based automation system. CVR savings during the test are evaluated and the aim to integrate it in the VVC is presented.",0
"The ignoring delete lists relaxation is of paramount importance for both satisficing and optimal planning. In earlier work, it was observed that the optimal relaxation heuristic h+ has amazing qualities in many classical planning benchmarks, in particular pertaining to the complete absence of local minima. The proofs of this are hand-made, raising the question whether such proofs can be lead automatically by domain analysis techniques. In contrast to earlier disappointing results -- the analysis method has exponential runtime and succeeds only in two extremely simple benchmark domains -- we herein answer this question in the affirmative. We establish connections between causal graph structure and h+ topology. This results in low-order polynomial time analysis methods, implemented in a tool we call TorchLight. Of the 12 domains where the absence of local minima has been proved, TorchLight gives strong success guarantees in 8 domains. Empirically, its analysis exhibits strong performance in a further 2 of these domains, plus in 4 more domains where local minima may exist but are rare. In this way, TorchLight can distinguish easy domains from hard ones. By summarizing structural reasons for analysis failure, TorchLight also provides diagnostic output indicating domain aspects that may cause local minima.",0
"This is a proposal to create a research facility for the development of a high-parallel version of the ""SP machine"", based on the ""SP theory of intelligence"". We envisage that the new version of the SP machine will be an open-source software virtual machine, derived from the existing ""SP computer model"", and hosted on an existing high-performance computer. It will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it. The SP system is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. Potential benefits and applications include helping to solve problems associated with big data; facilitating the development of autonomous robots; unsupervised learning, natural language processing, several kinds of reasoning, fuzzy pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction, computer vision, best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval, software engineering, medical diagnosis, simplification of computing systems, and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Additional motivations include the potential of the SP system to help solve problems in defence, security, and the detection and prevention of crime; potential in terms of economic, social, environmental, and academic criteria, and in terms of publicity; and the potential for international influence in research. The main elements of the proposed facility are described, including support for the development of ""SP-neural"", a neural version of the SP machine. The facility should be permanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future, and it should be designed to facilitate its use by researchers anywhere in the world.",0
"In this paper, we study the impact of selection methods in the context of on-line on-board distributed evolutionary algorithms. We propose a variant of the mEDEA algorithm in which we add a selection operator, and we apply it in a taskdriven scenario. We evaluate four selection methods that induce different intensity of selection pressure in a multi-robot navigation with obstacle avoidance task and a collective foraging task. Experiments show that a small intensity of selection pressure is sufficient to rapidly obtain good performances on the tasks at hand. We introduce different measures to compare the selection methods, and show that the higher the selection pressure, the better the performances obtained, especially for the more challenging food foraging task.",0
"We propose several neural models arranged in a two-stage framework to tackle question generation from documents. First, we estimate the probability of ""interesting"" answers in a document using a neural model trained on a question-answering corpus. The predicted key phrases are then used as answers to condition a sequence-to-sequence question generation model. Empirically, our neural key phrase detection models significantly outperform an entity-tagging baseline system. We demonstrate that the question generator formulates good quality natural language questions from extracted key phrases. The resulting questions and answers can be used to assess reading comprehension in educational settings.",0
"Owing to the rapidly growing multimedia content available on the Internet, extractive spoken document summarization, with the purpose of automatically selecting a set of representative sentences from a spoken document to concisely express the most important theme of the document, has been an active area of research and experimentation. On the other hand, word embedding has emerged as a newly favorite research subject because of its excellent performance in many natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. However, as far as we are aware, there are relatively few studies investigating its use in extractive text or speech summarization. A common thread of leveraging word embeddings in the summarization process is to represent the document (or sentence) by averaging the word embeddings of the words occurring in the document (or sentence). Then, intuitively, the cosine similarity measure can be employed to determine the relevance degree between a pair of representations. Beyond the continued efforts made to improve the representation of words, this paper focuses on building novel and efficient ranking models based on the general word embedding methods for extractive speech summarization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",0
"We propose an abstraction-based multi-document summarization framework that can construct new sentences by exploring more fine-grained syntactic units than sentences, namely, noun/verb phrases. Different from existing abstraction-based approaches, our method first constructs a pool of concepts and facts represented by phrases from the input documents. Then new sentences are generated by selecting and merging informative phrases to maximize the salience of phrases and meanwhile satisfy the sentence construction constraints. We employ integer linear optimization for conducting phrase selection and merging simultaneously in order to achieve the global optimal solution for a summary. Experimental results on the benchmark data set TAC 2011 show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models under automated pyramid evaluation metric, and achieves reasonably well results on manual linguistic quality evaluation.",1
"Moving beyond the dualistic view in AI where agent and environment are separated incurs new challenges for decision making, as calculation of expected utility is no longer straightforward. The non-dualistic decision theory literature is split between causal decision theory and evidential decision theory. We extend these decision algorithms to the sequential setting where the agent alternates between taking actions and observing their consequences. We find that evidential decision theory has two natural extensions while causal decision theory only has one.",0
"Deciding what to sense is a crucial task, made harder by dependencies and by a nonadditive utility function. We develop approximation algorithms for selecting an optimal set of measurements, under a dependency structure modeled by a tree-shaped Bayesian network (BN). Our approach is a generalization of composing anytime algorithm represented by conditional performance profiles. This is done by relaxing the input monotonicity assumption, and extending the local compilation technique to more general classes of performance profiles (PPs). We apply the extended scheme to selecting a subset of measurements for choosing a maximum expectation variable in a binary valued BN, and for minimizing the worst variance in a Gaussian BN.",0
"A submarine's sonar team is responsible for detecting, localising and classifying targets using information provided by the platform's sensor suite. The information used to make these assessments is typically uncertain and/or incomplete and is likely to require a measure of confidence in its reliability. Moreover, improvements in sensor and communication technology are resulting in increased amounts of on-platform and off-platform information available for evaluation. This proliferation of imprecise information increases the risk of overwhelming the operator. To assist the task of localisation and classification a concept demonstration decision aid (Horizon), based on evidential reasoning, has been developed. Horizon is an information fusion software package for representing and fusing imprecise information about the state of the world, expressed across suitable frames of reference.

"Recent research has shown great progress on fine-grained entity typing. Most existing methods require pre-defining a set of types and training a multi-class classifier from a large labeled data set based on multi-level linguistic features. They are thus limited to certain domains, genres and languages. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised entity typing framework by combining symbolic and distributional semantics. We start from learning general embeddings for each entity mention, compose the embeddings of specific contexts using linguistic structures, link the mention to knowledge bases and learn its related knowledge representations. Then we develop a novel joint hierarchical clustering and linking algorithm to type all mentions using these representations. This framework doesn't rely on any annotated data, predefined typing schema, or hand-crafted features, therefore it can be quickly adapted to a new domain, genre and language. Furthermore, it has great flexibility at incorporating linguistic structures (e.g., Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), dependency relations) to improve specific context representation. Experiments on genres (news and discussion forum) show comparable performance with state-of-the-art supervised typing systems trained from a large amount of labeled data. Results on various languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Hausa, and Yoruba) and domains (general and biomedical) demonstrate the portability of our framework.",0
"Probabilistic programming is considered as a framework, in which basic components of cognitive architectures can be represented in unified and elegant fashion. At the same time, necessity of adopting some component of cognitive architectures for extending capabilities of probabilistic programming languages is pointed out. In particular, implicit specification of generative models via declaration of concepts and links between them is proposed, and usefulness of declarative knowledge for achieving efficient inference is briefly discussed.",0
"Stochastic network design is a general framework for optimizing network connectivity. It has several applications in computational sustainability including spatial conservation planning, pre-disaster network preparation, and river network optimization. A common assumption in previous work has been made that network parameters (e.g., probability of species colonization) are precisely known, which is unrealistic in real- world settings. We therefore address the robust river network design problem where the goal is to optimize river connectivity for fish movement by removing barriers. We assume that fish passability probabilities are known only imprecisely, but are within some interval bounds. We then develop a planning approach that computes the policies with either high robust ratio or low regret. Empirically, our approach scales well to large river networks. We also provide insights into the solutions generated by our robust approach, which has significantly higher robust ratio than the baseline solution with mean parameter estimates.",1
"Gradient-based approaches to direct policy search in reinforcement learning have received much recent attention as a means to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of the problems associated with policy degradation in value-function methods. In this paper we introduce GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes POMDPs controlled by parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by (Kimura et al. 1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters, uses one free beta (which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to controlled Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order derivatives, and a version for training stochastic policies with internal states. In a companion paper (Baxter et al., this volume) we show how the gradient estimates generated by GPOMDP can be used in both a traditional stochastic gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.",0
"In this paper, we consider several types of information and methods of combination associated with incomplete probabilistic systems. We discriminate between 'a priori' and evidential information. The former one is a description of the whole population, the latest is a restriction based on observations for a particular case. Then, we propose different combination methods for each one of them. We also consider conditioning as the heterogeneous combination of 'a priori' and evidential information. The evidential information is represented as a convex set of likelihood functions. These will have an associated possibility distribution with behavior according to classical Possibility Theory.",0
"In this paper we follow our previous research in the area of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). We present three different methods for CAT. One of them, the item response theory, is a well established method, while the other two, Bayesian and neural networks, are new in the area of educational testing. In the first part of this paper, we present the concept of CAT and its advantages and disadvantages. We collected data from paper tests performed with grammar school students. We provide the summary of data used for our experiments in the second part. Next, we present three different model types for CAT. They are based on the item response theory, Bayesian networks, and neural networks. The general theory associated with each type is briefly explained and the utilization of these models for CAT is analyzed. Future research is outlined in the concluding part of the paper. It shows many interesting research paths that are important not only for CAT but also for other areas of artificial intelligence.",0
"A college student's life can be primarily categorized into domains such as education, health, social and other activities which may include daily chores and travelling time. Time management is crucial for every student. A self realisation of one's daily time expenditure in various domains is therefore essential to maximize one's effective output. This paper presents how a mobile application using Fuzzy Logic and Global Positioning System (GPS) analyzes a student's lifestyle and provides recommendations and suggestions based on the results.",0
"Although many algorithms have been designed to construct Bayesian network structures using different approaches and principles, they all employ only two methods: those based on independence criteria, and those based on a scoring function and a search procedure (although some methods combine the two). Within the score+search paradigm, the dominant approach uses local search methods in the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the usual choices for defining the elementary modifications (local changes) that can be applied are arc addition, arc deletion, and arc reversal. In this paper, we propose a new local search method that uses a different search space, and which takes account of the concept of equivalence between network structures: restricted acyclic partially directed graphs (RPDAGs). In this way, the number of different configurations of the search space is reduced, thus improving efficiency. Moreover, although the final result must necessarily be a local optimum given the nature of the search method, the topology of the new search space, which avoids making early decisions about the directions of the arcs, may help to find better local optima than those obtained by searching in the DAG space. Detailed results of the evaluation of the proposed search method on several test problems, including the well-known Alarm Monitoring System, are also presented.",0
"Importance of document clustering is now widely acknowledged by researchers for better management, smart navigation, efficient filtering, and concise summarization of large collection of documents like World Wide Web (WWW). The next challenge lies in semantically performing clustering based on the semantic contents of the document. The problem of document clustering has two main components: (1) to represent the document in such a form that inherently captures semantics of the text. This may also help to reduce dimensionality of the document, and (2) to define a similarity measure based on the semantic representation such that it assigns higher numerical values to document pairs which have higher semantic relationship. Feature space of the documents can be very challenging for document clustering. A document may contain multiple topics, it may contain a large set of class-independent general-words, and a handful class-specific core-words. With these features in mind, traditional agglomerative clustering algorithms, which are based on either Document Vector model (DVM) or Suffix Tree model (STC), are less efficient in producing results with high cluster quality. This paper introduces a new approach for document clustering based on the Topic Map representation of the documents. The document is being transformed into a compact form. A similarity measure is proposed based upon the inferred information through topic maps data and structures. The suggested method is implemented using agglomerative hierarchal clustering and tested on standard Information retrieval (IR) datasets. The comparative experiment reveals that the proposed approach is effective in improving the cluster quality.",0
"Deep Reinforcement Learning methods have achieved state of the art performance in learning control policies for the games in the Atari 2600 domain. One of the important parameters in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is the frame skip rate. It decides the granularity at which agents can control game play. A frame skip value of $k$ allows the agent to repeat a selected action $k$ number of times. The current state of the art architectures like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dueling Network Architectures (DuDQN) consist of a framework with a static frame skip rate, where the action output from the network is repeated for a fixed number of frames regardless of the current state. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Dynamic Frame skip Deep Q-Network (DFDQN) which makes the frame skip rate a dynamic learnable parameter. This allows us to choose the number of times an action is to be repeated based on the current state. We show empirically that such a setting improves the performance on relatively harder games like Seaquest.",0
"The goal of our research was to enhance local search heuristics used to construct Latin Hypercube Designs. First, we introduce the \textit{1D-move} perturbation to improve the space exploration performed by these algorithms. Second, we propose a new evaluation function $\psi_{p,\sigma}$ specifically targeting the Maximin criterion.",0
"Mapping in the GPS-denied environment is an important and challenging task in the field of robotics. In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of relative motions. Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate relative motions for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable relative motions as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable relative motions obtained from the pair-wise map merging. Subsequently, the accurate global motions can be recovered from the set of reliable relative motions by the motion averaging. Experimental results carried on real robot data sets demonstrate that proposed approach can achieve simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps with good performances.",0
"We propose a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that blends both generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from both source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model, DAuto. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.",0
"Traditional algorithms for robots who need to integrate into a wireless network often focus on one specific task. In this work we want to develop simple, adaptive and reusable algorithms for real world applications for this scenario. Starting with the most basic task for mobile wireless network nodes, finding the position of another node, we introduce an algorithm able to solve this task. We then show how this algorithm can readily be employed to solve a large number of other related tasks like finding the optimal position to bridge two static network nodes. For this we first introduce a meta-algorithm inspired by autonomous robot learning strategies and the concept of internal models which yields a class of source seeking algorithms for mobile nodes. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated in real world experiments using a physical mobile robot and standard 802.11 wireless LAN in an office environment. We also discuss the differences to conventional algorithms and give the robotics perspective on this class of algorithms. Then we proceed to show how more complex tasks, which might be encountered by mobile nodes, can be encoded in the same framework and how the introduced algorithm can solve them. These tasks can be direct (cross layer) optimization tasks or can also encode more complex tasks like bridging two network nodes. We choose the bridging scenario as an example, implemented on a real physical robot, and show how the robot can solve it in a real world experiment.",0
This paper describes a novel approach to medical diagnosis based on the SP theory of computing and cognition. The main attractions of this approach are: a format for representing diseases that is simple and intuitive; an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information; the simplicity of storing statistical information as frequencies of occurrence of diseases; a method for evaluating alternative diagnostic hypotheses that yields true probabilities; and a framework that should facilitate unsupervised learning of medical knowledge and the integration of medical diagnosis with other AI applications.,0
"So-called combined approaches answer a conjunctive query over a description logic ontology in three steps: first, they materialise certain consequences of the ontology and the data; second, they evaluate the query over the data; and third, they filter the result of the second phase to eliminate unsound answers. Such approaches were developed for various members of the DL-Lite and the EL families of languages, but none of them can handle ontologies containing nominals. In our work, we bridge this gap and present a combined query answering approach for ELHO---a logic that contains all features of the OWL 2 EL standard apart from transitive roles and complex role inclusions. This extension is nontrivial because nominals require equality reasoning, which introduces complexity into the first and the third step. Our empirical evaluation suggests that our technique is suitable for practical application, and so it provides a practical basis for conjunctive query answering in a large fragment of OWL 2 EL.",1
"Uncovering causal relationships in data is a major objective of data analytics. Causal relationships are normally discovered with designed experiments, e.g. randomised controlled trials, which, however are expensive or infeasible to be conducted in many cases. Causal relationships can also be found using some well designed observational studies, but they require domain experts' knowledge and the process is normally time consuming. Hence there is a need for scalable and automated methods for causal relationship exploration in data. Classification methods are fast and they could be practical substitutes for finding causal signals in data. However, classification methods are not designed for causal discovery and a classification method may find false causal signals and miss the true ones. In this paper, we develop a causal decision tree where nodes have causal interpretations. Our method follows a well established causal inference framework and makes use of a classic statistical test. The method is practical for finding causal signals in large data sets.",0
"Homogeneous unstructured data (HUD) are collections of unstructured documents that share common properties, such as similar layout, common file format, or common domain of values. Building on such properties, it would be desirable to automatically process HUD to access the main information through a semantic layer -- typically an ontology -- called semantic view. Hence, we propose an ontology-based approach for extracting semantically rich information from HUD, by integrating and extending recent technologies and results from the fields of classical information extraction, table recognition, ontologies, text annotation, and logic programming. Moreover, we design and implement a system, named KnowRex, that has been successfully applied to curriculum vitae in the Europass style to offer a semantic view of them, and be able, for example, to select those which exhibit required skills.",0
"An important subclass of hybrid Bayesian networks are those that represent Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG) distributions --- a distribution with a multivariate Gaussian component for each instantiation of the discrete variables. In this paper we explore the problem of inference in CLGs. We show that inference in CLGs can be significantly harder than inference in Bayes Nets. In particular, we prove that even if the CLG is restricted to an extremely simple structure of a polytree in which every continuous node has at most one discrete ancestor, the inference task is NP-hard.To deal with the often prohibitive computational cost of the exact inference algorithm for CLGs, we explore several approximate inference algorithms. These algorithms try to find a small subset of Gaussians which are a good approximation to the full mixture distribution. We consider two Monte Carlo approaches and a novel approach that enumerates mixture components in order of prior probability. We compare these methods on a variety of problems and show that our novel algorithm is very promising for large, hybrid diagnosis problems.",0
"Decision theory has become widely accepted in the AI community as a useful framework for planning and decision making. Applying the framework typically requires elicitation of some form of probability and utility information. While much work in AI has focused on providing representations and tools for elicitation of probabilities, relatively little work has addressed the elicitation of utility models. This imbalance is not particularly justified considering that probability models are relatively stable across problem instances, while utility models may be different for each instance. Spending large amounts of time on elicitation can be undesirable for interactive systems used in low-stakes decision making and in time-critical decision making. In this paper we investigate the issues of reasoning with incomplete utility models. We identify patterns of problem instances where plans can be proved to be suboptimal if the (unknown) utility function satisfies certain conditions. We present an approach to planning and decision making that performs the utility elicitation incrementally and in a way that is informed by the domain model.",0
"Deontic logic is a very well researched branch of mathematical logic and philosophy. Various kinds of deontic logics are considered for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be used to model ethical codes for multi-agent systems. Furthermore we show how Hyper, a high performance theorem prover, can be used to prove properties of these ethical codes.",0
"The ways in which an agent's actions affect the world can often be modeled compactly using a set of relational probabilistic planning rules. This paper addresses the problem of learning such rule sets for multiple related tasks. We take a hierarchical Bayesian approach, in which the system learns a prior distribution over rule sets. We present a class of prior distributions parameterized by a rule set prototype that is stochastically modified to produce a task-specific rule set. We also describe a coordinate ascent algorithm that iteratively optimizes the task-specific rule sets and the prior distribution. Experiments using this algorithm show that transferring information from related tasks significantly reduces the amount of training data required to predict action effects in blocks-world domains.",0
"In their nature configuration problems are combinatorial (optimization) problems. In order to find a configuration a solver has to instantiate a number of components of a some type and each of these components can be used in a relation defined for a type. Therefore, many solutions of a configuration problem have symmetric ones which can be obtained by replacing some component of a solution by another one of the same type. These symmetric solutions decrease performance of optimization algorithms because of two reasons: a) they satisfy all requirements and cannot be pruned out from the search space; and b) existence of symmetric optimal solutions does not allow to prove the optimum in a feasible time.",0
"Sequence modeling with neural networks has lead to powerful models of symbolic music data. We address the problem of exploiting these models to reach creative musical goals. To this end we generalise previous work, which sampled Markovian sequence models under the constraint that the sequence belong to the language of a given finite state machine. We consider more expressive non-Markov models, thereby requiring approximate sampling which we provide in the form of an efficient sequential Monte Carlo method. In addition we provide and compare with a beam search strategy for conditional probability maximisation. Our algorithms are capable of convincingly re-harmonising famous musical works. To demonstrate this we provide visualisations, quantitative experiments, a human listening test and illustrative audio examples. We find both the sampling and optimisation procedures to be effective, yet complementary in character. For the case of highly permissive constraint sets, we find that sampling is to be preferred due to the overly regular nature of the optimisation based results.",0
"Online learning aims to perform nearly as well as the best hypothesis in hindsight. For some hypothesis classes, though, even finding the best hypothesis offline is challenging. In such offline cases, local search techniques are often employed and only local optimality guaranteed. For online decision-making with such hypothesis classes, we introduce local regret, a generalization of regret that aims to perform nearly as well as only nearby hypotheses. We then present a general algorithm to minimize local regret with arbitrary locality graphs. We also show how the graph structure can be exploited to drastically speed learning. These algorithms are then demonstrated on a diverse set of online problems: online disjunct learning, online Max-SAT, and online decision tree learning.",1
"In situ hybridisation gene expression information helps biologists identify where a gene is expressed. However, the databases that republish the experimental information are often both incomplete and inconsistent. This paper examines a system, Argudas, designed to help tackle these issues. Argudas is an evolution of an existing system, and so that system is reviewed as a means of both explaining and justifying the behaviour of Argudas. Throughout the discussion of Argudas a number of issues will be raised including the appropriateness of argumentation in biology and the challenges faced when integrating apparently similar online biological databases.",0
"The Center of Gravity (COG) method is one of the most popular defuzzification techniques of fuzzy mathematics. In earlier works the COG technique was properly adapted to be used as an assessment model (RFAM)and several variations of it (GRFAM, TFAM and TpFAM)were also constructed for the same purpose. In this paper the outcomes of all these models are compared to the corresponding outcomes of a traditional assessment method of the bi-valued logic, the Grade Point Average (GPA) Index. Examples are also presented illustrating our results.",0
"The multi-armed bandit problem (MBP) is the problem of finding, as accurately and quickly as possible, the most profitable option from a set of options that gives stochastic rewards by referring to past experiences. Inspired by fluctuated movements of a rigid body in a tug-of-war game, we formulated a unique search algorithm that we call the `tug-of-war (TOW) dynamics' for solving the MBP efficiently. The cognitive medium access, which refers to multi-user channel allocations in cognitive radio, can be interpreted as the competitive multi-armed bandit problem (CMBP); the problem is to determine the optimal strategy for allocating channels to users which yields maximum total rewards gained by all users. Here we show that it is possible to construct a physical device for solving the CMBP, which we call the `TOW Bombe', by exploiting the TOW dynamics existed in coupled incompressible-fluid cylinders. This analog computing device achieves the `socially-maximum' resource allocation that maximizes the total rewards in cognitive medium access without paying a huge computational cost that grows exponentially as a function of the problem size.",0
"Morris (1996, 1997) introduced preference-based definitions of knowledge and belief in standard state-space structures. This paper extends this preference-based approach to unawareness structures (Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper, 2006, 2008). By defining unawareness and knowledge in terms of preferences over acts in unawareness structures and showing their equivalence to the epistemic notions of unawareness and knowledge, we try to build a bridge between decision theory and epistemic logic. Unawareness of an event is characterized behaviorally as the event being null and its negation being null.",0
This paper shows how the Bayesian network paradigm can be used in order to solve combinatorial optimization problems. To do it some methods of structure learning from data and simulation of Bayesian networks are inserted inside Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). EDA are a new tool for evolutionary computation in which populations of individuals are created by estimation and simulation of the joint probability distribution of the selected individuals. We propose new approaches to EDA for combinatorial optimization based on the theory of probabilistic graphical models. Experimental results are also presented.,0
"Belief revision is an operation that aims at modifying old be-liefs so that they become consistent with new ones. The issue of belief revision has been studied in various formalisms, in particular, in qualitative algebras (QAs) in which the result is a disjunction of belief bases that is not necessarily repre-sentable in a QA. This motivates the study of belief revision in formalisms extending QAs, namely, their propositional clo-sures: in such a closure, the result of belief revision belongs to the formalism. Moreover, this makes it possible to define a contraction operator thanks to the Harper identity. Belief revision in the propositional closure of QAs is studied, an al-gorithm for a family of revision operators is designed, and an open-source implementation is made freely available on the web.",0
The paper presents a novel view of the Dempster-Shafer belief function as a measure of diversity in relational data bases. It is demonstrated that under the interpretation The Dempster rule of evidence combination corresponds to the join operator of the relational database theory. This rough-set based interpretation is qualitative in nature and can represent a number of belief function operators.,0
"In the event that a bacteriological or chemical toxin is intro- duced to a water distribution network, a large population of consumers may become exposed to the contaminant. A contamination event may be poorly predictable dynamic process due to the interactions of consumers and utility managers during an event. Consumers that become aware of a threat may select protective actions that change their water demands from typical demand patterns, and new hydraulic conditions can arise that differ from conditions that are predicted when demands are considered as exogenous inputs. Consequently, the movement of the contaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from its expected trajectory. A sociotechnical model is developed here to integrate agent-based models of consumers with an engineering water distribution system model and capture the dynamics between consumer behaviors and the water distribution system for predicting contaminant transport and public exposure. Consumers are simulated as agents with behaviors defined for water use activities, mobility, word-of-mouth communication, and demand reduction, based on a set of rules representing an agents autonomy and reaction to health impacts, the environment, and the actions of other agents. As consumers decrease their water use, the demand exerted on the water distribution system is updated; as the flow directions and volumes shift in response, the location of the contaminant plume is updated and the amount of contaminant consumed by each agent is calculated. The framework is tested through simulating realistic contamination scenarios for a virtual city and water distribution system.",0
"To achieve scalability of query answering, the developers of Semantic Web applications are often forced to use incomplete OWL 2 reasoners, which fail to derive all answers for at least one query, ontology, and data set. The lack of completeness guarantees, however, may be unacceptable for applications in areas such as health care and defence, where missing answers can adversely affect the applications functionality. Furthermore, even if an application can tolerate some level of incompleteness, it is often advantageous to estimate how many and what kind of answers are being lost.",0
"In this paper, we investigate knowledge reasoning within a simple framework called knowledge structure. We use variable forgetting as a basic operation for one agent to reason about its own or other agents\ knowledge. In our framework, two notions namely agents\ observable variables and the weakest sufficient condition play important roles in knowledge reasoning. Given a background knowledge base and a set of observable variables for each agent, we show that the notion of an agent knowing a formula can be defined as a weakest sufficient condition of the formula under background knowledge base. Moreover, we show how to capture the notion of common knowledge by using a generalized notion of weakest sufficient condition. Also, we show that public announcement operator can be conveniently dealt with via our notion of knowledge structure. Further, we explore the computational complexity of the problem whether an epistemic formula is realized in a knowledge structure. In the general case, this problem is PSPACE-hard; however, for some interesting subcases, it can be reduced to co-NP. Finally, we discuss possible applications of our framework in some interesting domains such as the automated analysis of the well-known muddy children puzzle and the verification of the revised Needham-Schroeder protocol. We believe that there are many scenarios where the natural presentation of the available information about knowledge is under the form of a knowledge structure. What makes it valuable compared with the corresponding multi-agent S5 Kripke structure is that it can be much more succinct.",0
"Being able to automatically and quickly understand the user context during a session is a main issue for recommender systems. As a first step toward achieving that goal, we propose a model that observes in real time the diversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations, corresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in constant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an online service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application domain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have partial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time allows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize the context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of items between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow us to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain them to users. As this is an ongoing research, the first step consists here in studying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In order to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000 consultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the relevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context and events, such as ends of session. Of course, these events are a subset of the possible changes of context, since there might be several contexts within a session. We altered the quality of our corpus in several manners, so as to test the performances of our model when confronted with sparsity and different types of items. The results show that our model is robust and constitutes a promising approach.",0
"Demand response (DR) for residential and small commercial buildings is estimated to account for as much as 65% of the total energy savings potential of DR, and previous work shows that a fully automated Energy Management System (EMS) is a necessary prerequisite to DR in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel EMS formulation for DR problems in these sectors. Specifically, we formulate a fully automated EMS's rescheduling problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem (referred to as the device based RL problem), and show that this RL problem decomposes over devices under reasonable assumptions. Compared with existing formulations, our new formulation (1) does not require explicitly modeling the user's dissatisfaction on job rescheduling, (2) enables the EMS to self-initiate jobs, (3) allows the user to initiate more flexible requests and (4) has a computational complexity linear in the number of devices. We also propose several new performance metrics for RL algorithms applied to the device based RL problem, and demonstrate the simulation results of applying Q-learning, one of the most popular and classical RL algorithms, to a representative example.",0
"The situation assessment problem is considered, in terms of object, condition, activity, and plan recognition, based on data coming from the real-word {em via} various sensors. It is shown that uncertainty issues are linked both to the models and to the matching algorithm. Three different types of uncertainties are identified, and within each one, the numerical and the symbolic cases are distinguished. The emphasis is then put on purely symbolic uncertainties: it is shown that they can be dealt with within a purely symbolic framework resulting from a transposition of classical numerical estimation tools.",0
"We study automatic question generation for sentences from text passages in reading comprehension. We introduce an attention-based sequence learning model for the task and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs. paragraph-level information. In contrast to all previous work, our model does not rely on hand-crafted rules or a sophisticated NLP pipeline; it is instead trainable end-to-end via sequence-to-sequence learning. Automatic evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system are also rated as being more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and as more difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from the original text and reasoning needed to answer).",1
"The recent tremendous success of unsupervised word embeddings in a multitude of applications raises the obvious question if similar methods could be derived to improve embeddings (i.e. semantic representations) of word sequences as well. We present a simple but efficient unsupervised objective to train distributed representations of sentences. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised models on most benchmark tasks, and on many tasks even beats supervised models, highlighting the robustness of the produced sentence embeddings.",0
"We investigate the problem of winner determination from computational social choice theory in the data stream model. Specifically, we consider the task of summarizing an arbitrarily ordered stream of $n$ votes on $m$ candidates into a small space data structure so as to be able to obtain the winner determined by popular voting rules. As we show, finding the exact winner requires storing essentially all the votes. So, we focus on the problem of finding an {\em $\eps$-winner}, a candidate who could win by a change of at most $\eps$ fraction of the votes. We show non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the space complexity of $\eps$-winner determination for several voting rules, including $k$-approval, $k$-veto, scoring rules, approval, maximin, Bucklin, Copeland, and plurality with run off.",0
"In this paper, we analyze the decision version of the NK landscape model from the perspective of threshold phenomena and phase transitions under two random distributions, the uniform probability model and the fixed ratio model. For the uniform probability model, we prove that the phase transition is easy in the sense that there is a polynomial algorithm that can solve a random instance of the problem with the probability asymptotic to 1 as the problem size tends to infinity. For the fixed ratio model, we establish several upper bounds for the solubility threshold, and prove that random instances with parameters above these upper bounds can be solved polynomially. This, together with our empirical study for random instances generated below and in the phase transition region, suggests that the phase transition of the fixed ratio model is also easy.",0
"In view of the paradigm shift that makes science ever more data-driven, in this thesis we propose a synthesis method for encoding and managing large-scale deterministic scientific hypotheses as uncertain and probabilistic data. In the form of mathematical equations, hypotheses symmetrically relate aspects of the studied phenomena. For computing predictions, however, deterministic hypotheses are used asymmetrically as functions. We build upon Simon's notion of structural equations in order to extract the (so-called) causal ordering embedded in a hypothesis structure (set of mathematical equations).",0
"Situation calculus has been widely applied in Artificial Intelligence related fields. This formalism is considered as a dialect of logic programming language and mostly used in dynamic domain modeling. However, type systems are hardly deployed in situation calculus in the literature. To achieve a correct and sound typed program written in situation calculus, adding typing elements into the current situation calculus will be quite helpful. In this paper, we propose to add more typing mechanisms to the current version of situation calculus, especially for three basic elements in situation calculus: situations, actions and objects, and then perform rigid type checking for existing situation calculus programs to find out the well-typed and ill-typed ones. In this way, type correctness and soundness in situation calculus programs can be guaranteed by type checking based on our type system. This modified version of a lightweight situation calculus is proved to be a robust and well-typed system.",0
Many engineering optimization problems can be considered as linear programming problems where all or some of the parameters involved are linguistic in nature. These can only be quantified using fuzzy sets. The aim of this paper is to solve a fuzzy linear programming problem in which the parameters involved are fuzzy quantities with logistic membership functions. To explore the applicability of the method a numerical example is considered to determine the monthly production planning quotas and profit of a home textile group.,0
"In this paper, we formulate a qualitative ""linear"" utility theory for lotteries in which uncertainty is expressed qualitatively using a Spohnian disbelief function. We argue that a rational decision maker facing an uncertain decision problem in which the uncertainty is expressed qualitatively should behave so as to maximize ""qualitative expected utility."" Our axiomatization of the qualitative utility is similar to the axiomatization developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern for probabilistic lotteries. We compare our results with other recent results in qualitative decision making.",0
"Use of knowledge-based planning tools can help alleviate the challenges of planning a complex operation by a coalition of diverse parties in an adversarial environment. We explore these challenges and potential contributions of knowledge-based tools using as an example the CADET system, a knowledge-based tool capable of producing automatically (or with human guidance) battle plans with realistic degree of detail and complexity. In ongoing experiments, it compared favorably with human planners. Interleaved planning, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption processes comprise the computational approach of this tool. From the coalition operations perspective, such tools offer an important aid in rapid synchronization of assets and actions of heterogeneous assets belonging to multiple organizations, potentially with distinct doctrine and rules of engagement. In this paper, we discuss the functionality of the tool, provide a brief overview of the technical approach and experimental results, and outline the potential value of such tools.",0
"We investigate the potential of using ordinal peer grading for the evaluation of students in massive online open courses (MOOCs). According to such grading schemes, each student receives a few assignments (by other students) which she has to rank. Then, a global ranking (possibly translated into numerical scores) is produced by combining the individual ones. This is a novel application area for social choice concepts and methods where the important problem to be solved is as follows: how should the assignments be distributed so that the collected individual rankings can be easily merged into a global one that is as close as possible to the ranking that represents the relative performance of the students in the assignment? Our main theoretical result suggests that using very simple ways to distribute the assignments so that each student has to rank only $k$ of them, a Borda-like aggregation method can recover a $1-O(1/k)$ fraction of the true ranking when each student correctly ranks the assignments she receives. Experimental results strengthen our analysis further and also demonstrate that the same method is extremely robust even when students have imperfect capabilities as graders. We believe that our results provide strong evidence that ordinal peer grading can be a highly effective and scalable solution for evaluation in MOOCs.",0
"We study the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems involving global constraints, i.e., special-purpose constraints provided by a solver and represented implicitly by a parametrised algorithm. Such constraints are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.",0
"Many real-world tasks involve multiple agents with partial observability and limited communication. Learning is challenging in these settings due to local viewpoints of agents, which perceive the world as non-stationary due to concurrently-exploring teammates. Approaches that learn specialized policies for individual tasks face major problems when applied to the real world: not only do agents have to learn and store a distinct policy for each task, but in practice the identity of the task is often non-observable, making these algorithms inapplicable. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of multi-task multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability. We introduce a decentralized single-task learning approach that is robust to concurrent interactions of teammates, and present an approach for distilling single-task policies into a unified policy that performs well across multiple related tasks, without explicit provision of task identity.",1
"This paper studies the applicability of evolutionary algorithms, particularly, the evolution strategies family to estimation of a degradation parameter (referred as kappa parameter) for the shear design of reinforced concrete beams, a problem which have an expensive computational cost and highly relevant in the design of pillars and reinforced concrete structures, which however, has not been covered extensively in the present literature.",0
"A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in the protocols developed by the agents, all learned without any human supervision!",1
"Pairwise comparisons between alternatives are a well-known method of decision-making. Since the preferences do often not exhibit consistency, a number of inconsistency indices have been defined in order to measure the deviation from this ideal case. Recently, some axioms have been proposed to identify indices that evaluate inconsistency correctly. Inconsistency rankings are weak orders on the set of pairwise comparison matrices with respect to their inconsistency level and can be defined by any inconsistency index. This study characterizes a specific inconsistency ranking by providing six independent axioms such that they determine a unique weak order on the set of all pairwise comparison matrices.",0
"The purpose of this paper is to serve as a reference guide for the development of chatterbots implemented with the AIML language. In order to achieve this, the main concepts in Pattern Recognition area are described because the AIML uses such theoretical framework in their syntactic and semantic structures. After that, AIML language is described and each AIML command/tag is followed by an application example. Also, the usage of AIML embedded tags for the handling of sequence dialogue limitations between humans and machines is shown. Finally, computer systems that assist in the design of chatterbots with the AIML language are classified and described.",0
"This paper addresses the problem of automatic speech recognition (ASR) error detection and their use for improving spoken language understanding (SLU) systems. In this study, the SLU task consists in automatically extracting, from ASR transcriptions , semantic concepts and concept/values pairs in a e.g touristic information system. An approach is proposed for enriching the set of semantic labels with error specific labels and by using a recently proposed neural approach based on word embeddings to compute well calibrated ASR confidence measures. Experimental results are reported showing that it is possible to decrease significantly the Concept/Value Error Rate with a state of the art system, outperforming previously published results performance on the same experimental data. It also shown that combining an SLU approach based on conditional random fields with a neural encoder/decoder attention based architecture , it is possible to effectively identifying confidence islands and uncertain semantic output segments useful for deciding appropriate error handling actions by the dialogue manager strategy .",0
"Recently, Wang et al. discussed the properties of fuzzy information systems under homomorphisms in the paper [C. Wang, D. Chen, L. Zhu, Homomorphisms between fuzzy information systems, Applied Mathematics Letters 22 (2009) 1045-1050], where homomorphisms are based upon the concepts of consistent functions and fuzzy relation mappings. In this paper, we classify consistent functions as predecessor-consistent and successor-consistent, and then proceed to present more properties of consistent functions. In addition, we improve some characterizations of fuzzy relation mappings provided by Wang et al.",0
"Most Software Defined Networks (SDN) traffic engineering applications use excessive and frequent global monitoring in order to find the optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) paths for the current state of the network. In this work, we present the motivations, architecture and initial evaluation of a SDN application called Cognitive Routing Engine (CRE) which is able to find near-optimal paths for a user-specified QoS while using a very small monitoring overhead compared to global monitoring which is required to guarantee that optimal paths are found. Smaller monitoring overheads bring the advantage of smaller response time for the SDN controllers and switches. The initial evaluation of CRE on a SDN representation of the GEANT academic network shows that it is possible to find near-optimal paths with a small optimality gap of 1.65% while using 9.5 times less monitoring.",0
"Neuromorphic computing systems comprise net- works of neurons that use asynchronous events for both computation and communication. This type of representation offers several advantages in terms of bandwidth and power consumption in neuromorphic electronic systems. However, managing the traffic of asynchronous events in large scale systems is a daunting task, both in terms of circuit complexity and memory requirements. Here we present a novel routing methodology that employs both hierarchical and mesh routing strategies and combines heterogeneous memory structures for minimizing both memory requirements and latency, while maximizing programming flexibility to support a wide range of event-based neural network architectures, through parameter configuration. We validated the proposed scheme in a prototype multi-core neuromorphic processor chip that employs hybrid analog/digital circuits for emulating synapse and neuron dynamics together with asynchronous digital circuits for managing the address-event traffic. We present a theoretical analysis of the proposed connectivity scheme, describe the methods and circuits used to implement such scheme, and characterize the prototype chip. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the neuromorphic processor with a convolutional neural network for the real-time classification of visual symbols being flashed to a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) at high speed.",0
"Information delivery in a network of agents is a key issue for large, complex systems that need to do so in a predictable, efficient manner. The delivery of information in such multi-agent systems is typically implemented through routing protocols that determine how information flows through the network. Different routing protocols exist each with its own benefits, but it is generally unclear which properties can be successfully combined within a given algorithm. We approach this problem from the axiomatic point of view, i.e., we try to establish what are the properties we would seek to see in such a system, and examine the different properties which uniquely define common routing algorithms used today.",0
"Catastrophic forgetting is a problem which refers to losing the information of the first task after training from the second task in continual learning of neural networks. To resolve this problem, we propose the incremental moment matching (IMM), which uses the Bayesian neural network framework. IMM assumes that the posterior distribution of parameters of neural networks is approximated with Gaussian distribution and incrementally matches the moment of the posteriors, which are trained for the first and second task, respectively. To make our Gaussian assumption reasonable, the IMM procedure utilizes various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of old and new parameters, and a newly proposed variant of dropout using old parameters. We analyze our methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and then evaluate them on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass. Experimental results show that IMM produces state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets.",1
The problem of makespan optimal solving of cooperative path finding (CPF) is addressed in this paper. The task in CPF is to relocate a group of agents in a non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its goal location from the given initial location. The abstraction adopted in this work assumes that agents are discrete items moving in an undirected graph by traversing edges. Makespan optimal solving of CPF means to generate solutions that are as short as possi-ble in terms of the total number of time steps required for the execution of the solution.,0
"This paper presents our work on development of OWL-driven systems for formal representation and reasoning about terminological knowledge and facts in petrology. The long-term aim of our project is to provide solid foundations for a large-scale integration of various kinds of knowledge, including basic terms, rock classification algorithms, findings and reports. We describe three steps we have taken towards that goal here. First, we develop a semi-automated procedure for transforming a database of igneous rock samples to texts in a controlled natural language (CNL), and then a collection of OWL ontologies. Second, we create an OWL ontology of important petrology terms currently described in natural language thesauri. We describe a prototype of a tool for collecting definitions from domain experts. Third, we present an approach to formalization of current industrial standards for classification of rock samples, which requires linear equations in OWL 2. In conclusion, we discuss a range of opportunities arising from the use of semantic technologies in petrology and outline the future work in this area.",0
"In this note we consider the problem of introducing variables in temporal logic programs under the formalism of ""Temporal Equilibrium Logic"" (TEL), an extension of Answer Set Programming (ASP) for dealing with linear-time modal operators. To this aim, we provide a definition of a first-order version of TEL that shares the syntax of first-order Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) but has a different semantics, selecting some LTL models we call ""temporal stable models"". Then, we consider a subclass of theories (called ""splittable temporal logic programs"") that are close to usual logic programs but allowing a restricted use of temporal operators. In this setting, we provide a syntactic definition of ""safe variables"" that suffices to show the property of ""domain independence"" -- that is, addition of arbitrary elements in the universe does not vary the set of temporal stable models. Finally, we present a method for computing the derivable facts by constructing a non-temporal logic program with variables that is fed to a standard ASP grounder. The information provided by the grounder is then used to generate a subset of ground temporal rules which is equivalent to (and generally smaller than) the full program instantiation.",0
"We consider the problem of parameter estimation using weakly supervised datasets, where a training sample consists of the input and a partially specified annotation, which we refer to as the output. The missing information in the annotation is modeled using latent variables. Previous methods overburden a single distribution with two separate tasks: (i) modeling the uncertainty in the latent variables during training; and (ii) making accurate predictions for the output and the latent variables during testing. We propose a novel framework that separates the demands of the two tasks using two distributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty of the latent variables for a given input-output pair; and (ii) a delta distribution to predict the output and the latent variables for a given input. During learning, we encourage agreement between the two distributions by minimizing a loss-based dissimilarity coefficient. Our approach generalizes latent SVM in two important ways: (i) it models the uncertainty over latent variables instead of relying on a pointwise estimate; and (ii) it allows the use of loss functions that depend on latent variables, which greatly increases its applicability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two challenging problems---object detection and action detection---using publicly available datasets.",1
"Recent work on approximate linear programming (ALP) techniques for first-order Markov Decision Processes (FOMDPs) represents the value function linearly w.r.t. a set of first-order basis functions and uses linear programming techniques to determine suitable weights. This approach offers the advantage that it does not require simplification of the first-order value function, and allows one to solve FOMDPs independent of a specific domain instantiation. In this paper, we address several questions to enhance the applicability of this work: (1) Can we extend the first-order ALP framework to approximate policy iteration to address performance deficiencies of previous approaches? (2) Can we automatically generate basis functions and evaluate their impact on value function quality? (3) How can we decompose intractable problems with universally quantified rewards into tractable subproblems? We propose answers to these questions along with a number of novel optimizations and provide a comparative empirical evaluation on logistics problems from the ICAPS 2004 Probabilistic Planning Competition.",0
The potential risk of privacy leakage prevents users from sharing their honest opinions on social platforms. This paper addresses the problem of privacy preservation if the query returns the histogram of rankings. The framework of differential privacy is applied to rank aggregation. The error probability of the aggregated ranking is analyzed as a result of noise added in order to achieve differential privacy. Upper bounds on the error rates for any positional ranking rule are derived under the assumption that profiles are uniformly distributed. Simulation results are provided to validate the probabilistic analysis.,0
"Logical theories have been developed which have allowed temporal reasoning about eventualities (a la Galton) such as states, processes, actions, events, processes and complex eventualities such as sequences and recurrences of other eventualities. This paper presents the problem of coincidence within the framework of a first order logical theory formalising temporal multiple recurrence of two sequences of fixed duration eventualities and presents a solution to it The coincidence problem is described as: if two complex eventualities (or eventuality sequences) consisting respectively of component eventualities x0, x1,....,xr and y0, y1, ..,ys both recur over an interval k and all eventualities are of fixed durations, is there a sub-interval of k over which the incidence xt and yu for t between 0..r and s between 0..s coincide. The solution presented here formalises the intuition that a solution can be found by temporal projection over a cycle of the multiple recurrence of both sequences.",0
"Sustainable and economical generation of electrical power is an essential and mandatory component of infrastructure in today's world. Optimal generation (generator subset selection) of power requires a careful evaluation of various factors like type of source, generation, transmission &amp; storage capacities, congestion among others which makes this a difficult task. We created a grid to simulate various conditions including stimuli like generator supply, weather and load demand using Siemens PSS/E software and this data is trained using deep learning methods and subsequently tested. The results are highly encouraging. As per our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a working and scalable deep learning model for this problem.",0
"In many machine learning applications, labeled data is scarce and obtaining more labels is expensive. We introduce a new approach to supervising neural networks by specifying constraints that should hold over the output space, rather than direct examples of input-output pairs. These constraints are derived from prior domain knowledge, e.g., from known laws of physics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on real world and simulated computer vision tasks. We are able to train a convolutional neural network to detect and track objects without any labeled examples. Our approach can significantly reduce the need for labeled training data, but introduces new challenges for encoding prior knowledge into appropriate loss functions.",1
"Narrative intelligence is the ability to craft, tell, understand, and respond affectively to stories. We argue that instilling artificial intelligences with computational narrative intelligence affords a number of applications beneficial to humans.

"This paper provides a self-contained first introduction to description logics (DLs).

"Certain classes of problems, including perceptual data understanding, robotics, discovery, and learning, can be represented as incremental, dynamically constructed belief networks. These automatically constructed networks can be dynamically extended and modified as evidence of new individuals becomes available. The main result of this paper is the incremental extension of the singly connected polytree network in such a way that the network retains its singly connected polytree structure after the changes. The algorithm is deterministic and is guaranteed to have a complexity of single node addition that is at most of order proportional to the number of nodes (or size) of the network. Additional speed-up can be achieved by maintaining the path information. Despite its incremental and dynamic nature, the algorithm can also be used for probabilistic inference in belief networks in a fashion similar to other exact inference algorithms.",0
"Budget allocation in online advertising deals with distributing the campaign (insertion order) level budgets to different sub-campaigns which employ different targeting criteria and may perform differently in terms of return-on-investment (ROI). In this paper, we present the efforts at Turn on how to best allocate campaign budget so that the advertiser or campaign-level ROI is maximized. To do this, it is crucial to be able to correctly determine the performance of sub-campaigns. This determination is highly related to the action-attribution problem, i.e. to be able to find out the set of ads, and hence the sub-campaigns that provided them to a user, that an action should be attributed to. For this purpose, we employ both last-touch (last ad gets all credit) and multi-touch (many ads share the credit) attribution methodologies. We present the algorithms deployed at Turn for the attribution problem, as well as their parallel implementation on the large advertiser performance datasets. We conclude the paper with our empirical comparison of last-touch and multi-touch attribution-based budget allocation in a real online advertising setting.",0
"We study the (parameterized) complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY for multiwinner voting rules. We focus on SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, and Chamberlin-Courant, as well as on approximate variants of Chamberlin-Courant, since the original rule is NP-hard to compute. We show that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be significantly harder in the multiwinner setting than in the single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner ones. Moreover, we show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin-Courant rule sometimes affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.",1
"Given a current news event, we tackle the problem of generating plausible predictions of future events it might cause. We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor. To obtain precisely labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns. For generalization, the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies. Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm performs as well as non-expert humans.",0
Cox's well-known theorem justifying the use of probability is shown not to hold in finite domains. The counterexample also suggests that Cox's assumptions are insufficient to prove the result even in infinite domains. The same counterexample is used to disprove a result of Fine on comparative conditional probability.,0
"System Z+ [Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1991, Goldszmidt, 1992] is a formalism for reasoning with normality defaults of the form ""typically if phi then + (with strength cf)"" where 6 is a positive integer. The system has a critical shortcoming in that it does not sanction inheritance across exceptional subclasses. In this paper we propose an extension to System Z+ that rectifies this shortcoming by extracting additional conditions between worlds from the defaults database. We show that the additional constraints do not change the notion of the consistency of a database. We also make comparisons with competing default reasoning systems.",0
"Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star(RRT*) is a recently proposed extension of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm that provides a collision-free, asymptotically optimal path regardless of obstacle's geometry in a given environment. However, one of the limitations in the RRT* algorithm is slow convergence to optimal path solution. As a result, it consumes high memory as well as time due to a large number of iterations utilised in achieving optimal path solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Potential Function Based-RRT* (P-RRT*) that incorporates the Artificial Potential Field Algorithm in RRT*. The proposed algorithm allows a considerable decrease in the number of iterations and thus leads to more efficient memory utilization and an accelerated convergence rate. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm in terms of space execution and convergence rate, this paper presents rigorous simulation based comparisons between the proposed techniques and RRT* under different environmental conditions. Moreover, both algorithms are also tested and compared under non-holonomic differential constraints.",0
"We propose a structured approach to the problem of retrieval of images by content and present a description logic that has been devised for the semantic indexing and retrieval of images containing complex objects. As other approaches do, we start from low-level features extracted with image analysis to detect and characterize regions in an image. However, in contrast with feature-based approaches, we provide a syntax to describe segmented regions as basic objects and complex objects as compositions of basic ones. Then we introduce a companion extensional semantics for defining reasoning services, such as retrieval, classification, and subsumption. These services can be used for both exact and approximate matching, using similarity measures. Using our logical approach as a formal specification, we implemented a complete client-server image retrieval system, which allows a user to pose both queries by sketch and queries by example. A set of experiments has been carried out on a testbed of images to assess the retrieval capabilities of the system in comparison with expert users ranking. Results are presented adopting a well-established measure of quality borrowed from textual information retrieval.",0
"In order to identify an object, human eyes firstly search the field of view for points or areas which have particular properties. These properties are used to recognise an image or an object. Then this process could be taken as a model to develop computer algorithms for images identification. This paper proposes the idea of applying the simplified firefly algorithm to search for key-areas in 2D images. For a set of input test images the proposed version of firefly algorithm has been examined. Research results are presented and discussed to show the efficiency of this evolutionary computation method.",0
"Temporal Logic Model Checking is a verification method in which we describe a system, the model, and then we verify whether some properties, expressed in a temporal logic formula, hold in the system. It has many industrial applications. In order to improve performance, some tools allow preprocessing of the model, verifying on-line a set of properties reusing the same compiled model; we prove that the complexity of the Model Checking problem, without any preprocessing or preprocessing the model or the formula in a polynomial data structure, is the same. As a result preprocessing does not always exponentially improve performance.",0
"We define the concept of an internal symmetry. This is a symmety within a solution of a constraint satisfaction problem. We compare this to solution symmetry, which is a mapping between different solutions of the same problem. We argue that we may be able to exploit both types of symmetry when finding solutions. We illustrate the potential of exploiting internal symmetries on two benchmark domains: Van der Waerden numbers and graceful graphs. By identifying internal symmetries we are able to extend the state of the art in both cases.",1
"With the growth of the Semantic Web in size and importance, more and more knowledge is stored in machine-readable formats such as the Web Ontology Language OWL. This paper outlines common approaches for efficient reasoning on large-scale data consisting of billions ($10^9$) of triples. Therefore, OWL and its sublanguages, as well as forward and backward chaining techniques are presented. The WebPIE reasoner is discussed in detail as an example for forward chaining using MapReduce for materialisation. Moreover, the QueryPIE reasoner is presented as a backward chaining/hybrid approach which uses query rewriting. Furthermore, an overview on other reasoners is given such as OWLIM and TrOWL.",0
"Given a set of conflicting arguments, there can exist multiple plausible opinions about which arguments should be accepted, rejected, or deemed undecided. We study the problem of how multiple such judgments can be aggregated. We define the problem by adapting various classical social-choice-theoretic properties for the argumentation domain. We show that while argument-wise plurality voting satisfies many properties, it fails to guarantee the \emph{collective rationality} of the outcome, and struggles with ties. We then present more general results, proving multiple impossibility results on the existence of \emph{any} good aggregation operator. After characterising the sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to classical semantics allows us to escape the impossibility result. We close by listing graph-theoretic restrictions under which argument-wise plurality rule does produce collectively rational outcomes. In addition to identifying fundamental barriers to collective argument evaluation, our results open up the door for a new research agenda for the argumentation and computational social choice communities.",0

"It is well known that one can ignore parts of a belief network when computing answers to certain probabilistic queries. It is also well known that the ignorable parts (if any) depend on the specific query of interest and, therefore, may change as the query changes. Algorithms based on jointrees, however, do not seem to take computational advantage of these facts given that they typically construct jointrees for worst-case queries; that is, queries for which every part of the belief network is considered relevant. To address this limitation, we propose in this paper a method for reconfiguring jointrees dynamically as the query changes. The reconfiguration process aims at maintaining a jointree which corresponds to the underlying belief network after it has been pruned given the current query. Our reconfiguration method is marked by three characteristics: (a) it is based on a non-classical definition of jointrees; (b) it is relatively efficient; and (c) it can reuse some of the computations performed before a jointree is reconfigured. We present preliminary experimental results which demonstrate significant savings over using static jointrees when query changes are considerable.",0
"Qualitative possibilistic networks, also known as min-based possibilistic networks, are important tools for handling uncertain information in the possibility theory frame- work. Despite their importance, only the junction tree adaptation has been proposed for exact reasoning with such networks. This paper explores alternative algorithms using compilation techniques. We first propose possibilistic adaptations of standard compilation-based probabilistic methods. Then, we develop a new, purely possibilistic, method based on the transformation of the initial network into a possibilistic base. A comparative study shows that this latter performs better than the possibilistic adap- tations of probabilistic methods. This result is also confirmed by experimental results.",0
"This paper introduces Scavenger, the first theorem prover for pure first-order logic without equality based on the new conflict resolution calculus.

"Metric learning seeks a transformation of the feature space that enhances prediction quality for the given task at hand. In this work we provide PAC-style sample complexity rates for supervised metric learning. We give matching lower- and upper-bounds showing that the sample complexity scales with the representation dimension when no assumptions are made about the underlying data distribution. However, by leveraging the structure of the data distribution, we show that one can achieve rates that are fine-tuned to a specific notion of intrinsic complexity for a given dataset. Our analysis reveals that augmenting the metric learning optimization criterion with a simple norm-based regularization can help adapt to a dataset's intrinsic complexity, yielding better generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets validate our analysis and show that regularizing the metric can help discern the signal even when the data contains high amounts of noise.",1
"In traditional assembly lines, it is reasonable to assume that task execution times are the same for each worker. However, in sheltered work centres for disabled this assumption is not valid: some workers may execute some tasks considerably slower or even be incapable of executing them. Worker heterogeneity leads to a problem called the assembly line worker assignment and balancing problem (ALWABP). For a fixed number of workers the problem is to maximize the production rate of an assembly line by assigning workers to stations and tasks to workers, while satisfying precedence constraints between the tasks. This paper introduces new heuristic and exact methods to solve this problem. We present a new MIP model, propose a novel heuristic algorithm based on beam search, as well as a task-oriented branch-and-bound procedure which uses new reduction rules and lower bounds for solving the problem. Extensive computational tests on a large set of instances show that these methods are effective and improve over existing ones.",0
"This paper presents 'SimpleDS', a simple and publicly available dialogue system trained with deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to previous reinforcement learning dialogue systems, this system avoids manual feature engineering by performing action selection directly from raw text of the last system and (noisy) user responses.

"In a recent paper, we have shown that Plan Recognition over STRIPS can be formulated and solved using Classical Planning heuristics and algorithms. In this work, we show that this formulation subsumes the standard formulation of Plan Recognition over libraries through a compilation of libraries into STRIPS theories.

These libraries include Context-Free Grammars as a special case, where the Plan Recognition problem becomes a parsing with missing tokens problem.

"In most computer vision and image analysis problems, it is necessary to define a similarity measure between two or more different objects or images. Template matching is a classic and fundamental method used to score similarities between objects using certain mathematical algorithms. In this paper, we reviewed the basic concept of matching, as well as advances in template matching and applications such as invariant features or novel applications in medical image analysis. Additionally, deformable models and templates originating from classic template matching were discussed. These models have broad applications in image registration, and they are a fundamental aspect of novel machine vision or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which perform shift and scale invariant functions followed by classification. In general, although template matching methods have restrictions which limit their application, they are recommended for use with other object recognition methods as pre- or post-processing steps. Combining a template matching technique such as normalized cross-correlation or dice coefficient with a robust decision-making algorithm yields a significant improvement in the accuracy rate for object detection and recognition.",0
"Bayesian online learning algorithms for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) need to compute moments of model parameters under the one-step update posterior distribution. The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the size of the SPN, although it scales linearly for trees. We propose a linear-time algorithm that works even when the SPN is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We achieve this goal by reducing the moment computation problem into a joint inference problem in SPNs and by taking advantage of a special structure of the one-step update posterior distribution: it is a multilinear polynomial with exponentially many monomials, and we can evaluate moments by differentiating. The latter is known as the \emph{differential trick}. We apply the proposed algorithm to develop a linear time assumed density filter (ADF) for SPN parameter learning. As an additional contribution, we conduct extensive experiments comparing seven different online learning algorithms for SPNs on 20 benchmark datasets. The new linear-time ADF method consistently achieves low runtime due to the efficient linear-time algorithm for moment computation; however, we discover that two other methods (CCCP and SMA) typically perform better statistically, while a third (BMM) is comparable to ADF. Interestingly, CCCP can be viewed as implicitly using the same differentiation trick that we make explicit here. The fact that two of the top four fastest methods use this trick suggests that the same trick might find other uses for SPN learning in the future.",1
"This paper uses anthropic reasoning to argue for a reduced likelihood that superintelligent AI will come into existence in the future. To make this argument, a new principle is introduced: the Super-Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSSA), building on the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) and the Strong Self-Sampling Assumption (SSSA). SSA uses as its sample the relevant observers, whereas SSSA goes further by using observer-moments. SSSSA goes further still and weights each sample proportionally, according to the size of a mind in cognitive terms. SSSSA is required for human observer-samples to be typical, given by how much non-human animals outnumber humans. Given SSSSA, the assumption that humans experience typical observer-samples relies on a future where superintelligent AI does not dominate, which in turn reduces the likelihood of it being created at all.",0
Bayesian networks offer great potential for use in automating large scale diagnostic reasoning tasks. Gibbs sampling is the main technique used to perform diagnostic reasoning in large richly interconnected Bayesian networks. Unfortunately Gibbs sampling can take an excessive time to generate a representative sample. In this paper we describe and test a number of heuristic strategies for improving sampling in noisy-or Bayesian networks. The strategies include Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling techniques other than Gibbs sampling. Emphasis is put on strategies that can be implemented in distributed systems.,0
"Shannon's information entropy measures of the uncertainty of an event's outcome. If learning about a system reflects a decrease in uncertainty, then a plausible intuition is that learning should be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the organism's actions and/or perceptual states. To address whether this intuition is valid, I examined an artificial organism -- a simple robot -- that learned to navigate in an arena and analyzed the entropy of the outcome variables action, state, and reward. Entropy did indeed decrease in the initial stages of learning, but two factors complicated the scenario: (1) the introduction of new options discovered during the learning process and (2) the shifting patterns of perceptual and environmental states resulting from changes to the robot's learned movement strategies. These factors lead to a subsequent increase in entropy as the agent learned. I end with a discussion of the utility of information-based characterizations of learning.",0
"We argue that parameterized complexity is a useful tool with which to study global constraints. In particular, we show that many global constraints which are intractable to propagate completely have natural parameters which make them fixed-parameter tractable and which are easy to compute. This tractability tends either to be the result of a simple dynamic program or of a decomposition which has a strong backdoor of bounded size. This strong backdoor is often a cycle cutset. We also show that parameterized complexity can be used to study other aspects of constraint programming like symmetry breaking. For instance, we prove that value symmetry is fixed-parameter tractable to break in the number of symmetries. Finally, we argue that parameterized complexity can be used to derive results about the approximability of constraint propagation.",1
"Knowing where people live is a fundamental component of many decision making processes such as urban development, infectious disease containment, evacuation planning, risk management, conservation planning, and more. While bottom-up, survey driven censuses can provide a comprehensive view into the population landscape of a country, they are expensive to realize, are infrequently performed, and only provide population counts over broad areas. Population disaggregation techniques and population projection methods individually address these shortcomings, but also have shortcomings of their own. To jointly answer the questions of ""where do people live"" and ""how many people live there,"" we propose a deep learning model for creating high-resolution population estimations from satellite imagery. Specifically, we train convolutional neural networks to predict population in the USA at a $0.01^{\circ} \times 0.01^{\circ}$ resolution grid from 1-year composite Landsat imagery. We validate these models in two ways: quantitatively, by comparing our model's grid cell estimates aggregated at a county-level to several US Census county-level population projections, and qualitatively, by directly interpreting the model's predictions in terms of the satellite image inputs. We find that aggregating our model's estimates gives comparable results to the Census county-level population projections and that the predictions made by our model can be directly interpreted, which give it advantages over traditional population disaggregation methods. In general, our model is an example of how machine learning techniques can be an effective tool for extracting information from inherently unstructured, remotely sensed data to provide effective solutions to social problems.",0
"We propose a StochAstic Fault diagnosis AlgoRIthm, called SAFARI, which trades off guarantees of computing minimal diagnoses for computational efficiency. We empirically demonstrate, using the 74XXX and ISCAS-85 suites of benchmark combinatorial circuits, that SAFARI achieves several orders-of-magnitude speedup over two well-known deterministic algorithms, CDA* and HA*, for multiple-fault diagnoses; further, SAFARI can compute a range of multiple-fault diagnoses that CDA* and HA* cannot. We also prove that SAFARI is optimal for a range of propositional fault models, such as the widely-used weak-fault models (models with ignorance of abnormal behavior). We discuss the optimality of SAFARI in a class of strong-fault circuit models with stuck-at failure modes. By modeling the algorithm itself as a Markov chain, we provide exact bounds on the minimality of the diagnosis computed. SAFARI also displays strong anytime behavior, and will return a diagnosis after any non-trivial inference time.",0
"Although the CSP (constraint satisfaction problem) is NP-complete, even in the case when all constraints are binary, certain classes of instances are tractable. We study classes of instances defined by excluding subproblems. This approach has recently led to the discovery of novel tractable classes. The complete characterisation of all tractable classes defined by forbidding patterns (where a pattern is simply a compact representation of a set of subproblems) is a challenging problem. We demonstrate a dichotomy in the case of forbidden patterns consisting of either one or two constraints. This has allowed us to discover new tractable classes including, for example, a novel generalisation of 2SAT.",1
"This paper proposes a multimodal biometric system through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for face and ear biometrics with belief fusion of the estimated scores characterized by Gabor responses and the proposed fusion is accomplished by Dempster-Shafer (DS) decision theory. Face and ear images are convolved with Gabor wavelet filters to extracts spatially enhanced Gabor facial features and Gabor ear features. Further, GMM is applied to the high-dimensional Gabor face and Gabor ear responses separately for quantitive measurements. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate density parameters in GMM. This produces two sets of feature vectors which are then fused using Dempster-Shafer theory. Experiments are conducted on multimodal database containing face and ear images of 400 individuals. It is found that use of Gabor wavelet filters along with GMM and DS theory can provide robust and efficient multimodal fusion strategy.",0
"Probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian Networks are one of the most powerful structures known by the Computer Science community for deriving probabilistic inferences. However, modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgements. Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics, leading to violations of the law of total probability. This means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making.",0
"MOBAs represent a huge segment of online gaming and are growing as both an eSport and a casual genre. The natural starting point for AI researchers interested in MOBAs is to develop an AI to play the game better than a human - but MOBAs have many more challenges besides adversarial AI. In this paper we introduce the reader to the wider context of MOBA culture, propose a range of challenges faced by the community today, and posit concrete AI projects that can be undertaken to begin solving them.",0
"We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion invariants from temporal planning instances. It first identifies a set of invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance. Our technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the literature, but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by addressing temporal domains. To deal with time, we formulate invariance conditions that account for the entire structure of the actions and the possible concurrent interactions between them. As a result, we construct a significantly more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able to find not only invariants for temporal domains, but also a broader set of invariants for non-temporal domains. The experimental results reported in this paper provide evidence that identifying a broader set of invariants results in the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables with larger domains. We show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects positively on the performance of a number of temporal planners that use a variable/value representation by significantly reducing their running time.",0
"There exist two general forms of exact algorithms for updating probabilities in Bayesian Networks. The first approach involves using a structure, usually a clique tree, and performing local message based calculation to extract the belief in each variable. The second general class of algorithm involves the use of non-serial dynamic programming techniques to extract the belief in some desired group of variables. In this paper we present a hybrid algorithm based on the latter approach yet possessing the ability to retrieve the belief in all single variables. The technique is advantageous in that it saves a NP-hard computation step over using one algorithm of each type. Furthermore, this technique re-enforces a conjecture of Jensen and Jensen [JJ94] in that it still requires a single NP-hard step to set up the structure on which inference is performed, as we show by confirming Li and D'Ambrosio's [LD94] conjectured NP-hardness of OFP.",0
"Good parameter settings are crucial to achieve high performance in many areas of artificial intelligence (AI), such as satisfiability solving, AI planning, scheduling, and machine learning (in particular deep learning). Automated algorithm configuration methods have recently received much attention in the AI community since they replace tedious, irreproducible and error-prone manual parameter tuning and can lead to new state-of-the-art performance. However, practical applications of algorithm configuration are prone to several (often subtle) pitfalls in the experimental design that can render the procedure ineffective. We identify several common issues and propose best practices for avoiding them, including a tool called GenericWrapper4AC for preventing the many possible problems in measuring the performance of the algorithm being optimized by executing it in a standardized, controlled manner.",0
"To know which operators to apply and in which order, as well as attributing good values to their parameters is a challenge for users of computer vision. This paper proposes a solution to this problem as a multi-agent system modeled according to the Vowel approach and using the Q-learning algorithm to optimize its choice. An implementation is given to test and validate this method.",0
"We introduce the first deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to beat Atari games with the aid of natural language instructions. The agent uses a multimodal embedding between environment observations and natural language to self-monitor progress through a list of English instructions, granting itself reward for completing instructions in addition to increasing the game score. Our agent significantly outperforms Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) agents, and the best agents posted to OpenAI Gym on what is often considered the hardest Atari 2600 environment: Montezuma's Revenge.",0
"Dawid, Kjaerulff and Lauritzen (1994) provided a preliminary description of a hybrid between Monte-Carlo sampling methods and exact local computations in junction trees. Utilizing the strengths of both methods, such hybrid inference methods has the potential of expanding the class of problems which can be solved under bounded resources as well as solving problems which otherwise resist exact solutions. The paper provides a detailed description of a particular instance of such a hybrid scheme; namely, combination of exact inference and Gibbs sampling in discrete Bayesian networks. We argue that this combination calls for an extension of the usual message passing scheme of ordinary junction trees.",0
"The number of malicious software (malware) is growing out of control. Syntactic signature based detection cannot cope with such growth and manual construction of malware signature databases needs to be replaced by computer learning based approaches. Currently, a single modern signature capturing the semantics of a malicious behavior can be used to replace an arbitrarily large number of old-fashioned syntactical signatures. However teaching computers to learn such behaviors is a challenge. Existing work relies on dynamic analysis to extract malicious behaviors, but such technique does not guarantee the coverage of all behaviors. To sidestep this limitation we show how to learn malware signatures using static reachability analysis. The idea is to model binary programs using pushdown systems (that can be used to model the stack operations occurring during the binary code execution), use reachability analysis to extract behaviors in the form of trees, and use subtrees that are common among the trees extracted from a training set of malware files as signatures. To detect malware we propose to use a tree automaton to compactly store malicious behavior trees and check if any of the subtrees extracted from the file under analysis is malicious. Experimental data shows that our approach can be used to learn signatures from a training set of malware files and use them to detect a test set of malware that is 5 times the size of the training set.",0
"Machines of all kinds from vehicles to industrial equipment are increasingly instrumented with hundreds of sensors. Using such data to detect anomalous behaviour is critical for safety and efficient maintenance. However, anomalies occur rarely and with great variety in such systems, so there is often insufficient anomalous data to build reliable detectors. A standard approach to mitigate this problem is to use one class methods relying only on data from normal behaviour. Unfortunately, even these approaches are more likely to fail in the scenario of a dynamical system with manual control input(s). Normal behaviour in response to novel control input(s) might look very different to the learned detector which may be incorrectly detected as anomalous. In this paper, we address this issue by modelling time-series via Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and utilising such an ODE model to simulate the behaviour of dynamical systems under varying control inputs. The available data is then augmented with data generated from the ODE, and the anomaly detector is retrained on this augmented dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ODE-augmented training data allows better coverage of possible control input(s) and results in learning more accurate distinctions between normal and anomalous behaviour in time-series.",0
"We apply the principle of maximum entropy to select a unique joint probability distribution from the set of all joint probability distributions specified by a credal network. In detail, we start by showing that the unique joint distribution of a Bayesian tree coincides with the maximum entropy model of its conditional distributions. This result, however, does not hold anymore for general Bayesian networks. We thus present a new kind of maximum entropy models, which are computed sequentially. We then show that for all general Bayesian networks, the sequential maximum entropy model coincides with the unique joint distribution. Moreover, we apply the new principle of sequential maximum entropy to interval Bayesian networks and more generally to credal networks. We especially show that this application is equivalent to a number of small local entropy maximizations.",0
"In this paper we consider a logical treatment for the ordered disjunction operator 'x' introduced by Brewka, Niemel\""a and Syrj\""anen in their Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunctions (LPOD). LPODs are used to represent preferences in logic programming under the answer set semantics. Their semantics is defined by first translating the LPOD into a set of normal programs (called split programs) and then imposing a preference relation among the answer sets of these split programs. We concentrate on the first step and show how a suitable translation of the ordered disjunction as a derived operator into the logic of Here-and-There allows capturing the answer sets of the split programs in a direct way. We use this characterisation not only for providing an alternative implementation for LPODs, but also for checking several properties (under strongly equivalent transformations) of the 'x' operator, like for instance, its distributivity with respect to conjunction or regular disjunction. We also make a comparison to an extension proposed by K\""arger, Lopes, Olmedilla and Polleres, that combines 'x' with regular disjunction.",0
"Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular, distributed heuristic for performing MAP computations in Graphical Models. BP can be interpreted, from a variational perspective, as minimizing the Bethe Free Energy (BFE). BP can also be used to solve a special class of Linear Programming (LP) problems. For this class of problems, MAP inference can be stated as an integer LP with an LP relaxation that coincides with minimization of the BFE at ``zero temperature"". We generalize these prior results and establish a tight characterization of the LP problems that can be formulated as an equivalent LP relaxation of MAP inference. Moreover, we suggest an efficient, iterative annealing BP algorithm for solving this broader class of LP problems. We demonstrate the algorithm's performance on a set of weighted matching problems by using it as a cutting plane method to solve a sequence of LPs tightened by adding ``blossom'' inequalities.",0
"Counterfactual statements, e.g., ""my headache would be gone had I taken an aspirin"" are central to scientific discourse, and are formally interpreted as statements derived from ""alternative worlds"". However, since they invoke hypothetical states of affairs, often incompatible with what is actually known or observed, testing counterfactuals is fraught with conceptual and practical difficulties. In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of ""testable counterfactuals,"" namely, counterfactual statements whose probabilities can be inferred from physical experiments. We provide complete procedures for discerning whether a given counterfactual is testable and, if so, expressing its probability in terms of experimental data.",0
"Traditional approaches to building a large scale knowledge graph have usually relied on extracting information (entities, their properties, and relations between them) from unstructured text (e.g. Dbpedia). Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) allow us to shift our focus to learning entities and relations from images, as they build robust models that require little or no pre-processing of the images. In this paper, we present an approach to identify and extract spatial relations (e.g., The girl is standing behind the table) from images using CNNs. Our research addresses two specific challenges: providing insight into how spatial relations are learned by the network and which parts of the image are used to predict these relations. We use the pre-trained network VGGNet to extract features from an image and train a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) on a set of synthetic images and the sun09 dataset to extract spatial relations. The MLP predicts spatial relations without a bounding box around the objects or the space in the image depicting the relation. To understand how the spatial relations are represented in the network, a heatmap is overlayed on the image to show the regions that are deemed important by the network. Also, we analyze the MLP to show the relationship between the activation of consistent groups of nodes and the prediction of a spatial relation. We show how the loss of these groups affects the networks ability to identify relations.",0
"The obvious way to use several admissible heuristics in A* is to take their maximum. In this paper we aim to reduce the time spent on computing heuristics. We discuss Lazy A*, a variant of A* where heuristics are evaluated lazily: only when they are essential to a decision to be made in the A* search process. We present a new rational meta-reasoning based scheme, rational lazy A*, which decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics at all, based on a myopic value of information estimate. Both methods are examined theoretically. Empirical evaluation on several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that lazy A* and rational lazy A* are state-of-the-art heuristic combination methods.",0
"The character information in natural scene images contains various personal information, such as telephone numbers, home addresses, etc. It is a high risk of leakage the information if they are published. In this paper, we proposed a scene text erasing method to properly hide the information via an inpainting convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The input is a scene text image, and the output is expected to be text erased image with all the character regions filled up the colors of the surrounding background pixels. This work is accomplished by a CNN model through convolution to deconvolution with interconnection process. The training samples and the corresponding inpainting images are considered as teaching signals for training. To evaluate the text erasing performance, the output images are detected by a novel scene text detection method. Subsequently, the same measurement on text detection is utilized for testing the images in benchmark dataset ICDAR2013. Compared with direct text detection way, the scene text erasing process demonstrates a drastically decrease on the precision, recall and f-score. That proves the effectiveness of proposed method for erasing the text in natural scene images.",0
"The Stable Matching Problem with Couples (SMP-C) is a ubiquitous real-world extension of the stable matching problem (SMP) involving complementarities. Although SMP can be solved in polynomial time, SMP-C is NP-Complete. Hence, it is not clear which, if any, of the theoretical results surrounding the canonical SMP problem apply in this setting. In this paper, we use a recently-developed SAT encoding to solve SMP-C exactly. This allows us to enumerate all stable matchings for any given instance of SMP-C. With this tool, we empirically evaluate some of the properties that have been hypothesized to hold for SMP-C.",0
"Efficient modeling of uncertain information in real world is still an open issue. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is one of the most commonly used methods. However, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has the assumption that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other. This condition can be violated in real applications, especially in linguistic decision making since the linguistic variables are not exclusive of each others essentially. In this paper, a new theory, called as D numbers theory (DNT), is systematically developed to address this issue. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. An coefficient is defined to measure the exclusive degree among the hypotheses in the framework of discernment. The combination rule of two D numbers is presented. If the exclusive coefficient is one which means that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other totally, the D combination is degenerated as the classical Dempster combination rule. Finally, a linguistic variables transformation of D numbers is presented to make a decision. A numerical example on linguistic evidential decision making is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed D numbers theory.",0
"Off-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning methods using previously collected data can improve sample efficiency over on-policy policy gradient techniques. On the other hand, on-policy algorithms are often more stable and easier to use. This paper examines, both theoretically and empirically, approaches to merging on- and off-policy updates for deep reinforcement learning. Theoretical results show that off-policy updates with a value function estimator can be interpolated with on-policy policy gradient updates whilst still satisfying performance bounds. Our analysis uses control variate methods to produce a family of policy gradient algorithms, with several recently proposed algorithms being special cases of this family. We then provide an empirical comparison of these techniques with the remaining algorithmic details fixed, and show how different mixing of off-policy gradient estimates with on-policy samples contribute to improvements in empirical performance. The final algorithm provides a generalization and unification of existing deep policy gradient techniques, has theoretical guarantees on the bias introduced by off-policy updates, and improves on the state-of-the-art model-free deep RL methods on a number of OpenAI Gym continuous control benchmarks.",1
"Cyber-Physical Systems in general, and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in particular use heterogeneous data sources combined with problem solving expertise in order to make critical decisions that may lead to some form of actions e.g., driver notifications, change of traffic light signals and braking to prevent an accident. Currently, a major part of the decision process is done by human domain experts, which is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone. Additionally, due to the intrinsic nature of knowledge possession this decision process cannot be easily replicated or reused. Therefore, there is a need for automating the reasoning processes by providing computational systems a formal representation of the domain knowledge and a set of methods to process that knowledge. In this paper, we propose a knowledge model that can be used to express both declarative knowledge about the systems' components, their relations and their current state, as well as procedural knowledge representing possible system behavior. In addition, we introduce a framework for knowledge management and automated reasoning (KMARF). The idea behind KMARF is to automatically select an appropriate problem solver based on formalized reasoning expertise in the knowledge base, and convert a problem definition to the corresponding format. This approach automates reasoning, thus reducing operational costs, and enables reusability of knowledge and methods across different domains. We illustrate the approach on a transportation planning use case.",0
"We propose Neural Responding Machine (NRM), a neural network-based response generator for Short-Text Conversation. NRM takes the general encoder-decoder framework: it formalizes the generation of response as a decoding process based on the latent representation of the input text, while both encoding and decoding are realized with recurrent neural networks (RNN). The NRM is trained with a large amount of one-round conversation data collected from a microblogging service. Empirical study shows that NRM can generate grammatically correct and content-wise appropriate responses to over 75% of the input text, outperforming state-of-the-arts in the same setting, including retrieval-based and SMT-based models.",1
"Computing the probability of a formula given the probabilities or weights associated with other formulas is a natural extension of logical inference to the probabilistic setting. Surprisingly, this problem has received little attention in the literature to date, particularly considering that it includes many standard inference problems as special cases. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for this problem: formula decomposition and conditioning, which is an exact method, and formula importance sampling, which is an approximate method. The latter is, to our knowledge, the first application of model counting to approximate probabilistic inference. Unlike conventional variable-based algorithms, our algorithms work in the dual realm of logical formulas. Theoretically, we show that our algorithms can greatly improve efficiency by exploiting the structural information in the formulas. Empirically, we show that they are indeed quite powerful, often achieving substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes.",0
"The distinction between strong negation and default negation has been useful in answer set programming. We present an alternative account of strong negation, which lets us view strong negation in terms of the functional stable model semantics by Bartholomew and Lee. More specifically, we show that, under complete interpretations, minimizing both positive and negative literals in the traditional answer set semantics is essentially the same as ensuring the uniqueness of Boolean function values under the functional stable model semantics. The same account lets us view Lifschitz's two-valued logic programs as a special case of the functional stable model semantics. In addition, we show how non-Boolean intensional functions can be eliminated in favor of Boolean intensional functions, and furthermore can be represented using strong negation, which provides a way to compute the functional stable model semantics using existing ASP solvers. We also note that similar results hold with the functional stable model semantics by Cabalar.",0
"In this paper, we present a method for recognising an agent's behaviour in dynamic, noisy, uncertain domains, and across multiple levels of abstraction. We term this problem on-line plan recognition under uncertainty and view it generally as probabilistic inference on the stochastic process representing the execution of the agent's plan. Our contributions in this paper are twofold. In terms of probabilistic inference, we introduce the Abstract Hidden Markov Model (AHMM), a novel type of stochastic processes, provide its dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) structure and analyse the properties of this network. We then describe an application of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter to the AHMM which allows us to construct an efficient, hybrid inference method for this model. In terms of plan recognition, we propose a novel plan recognition framework based on the AHMM as the plan execution model. The Rao-Blackwellised hybrid inference for AHMM can take advantage of the independence properties inherent in a model of plan execution, leading to an algorithm for online probabilistic plan recognition that scales well with the number of levels in the plan hierarchy. This illustrates that while stochastic models for plan execution can be complex, they exhibit special structures which, if exploited, can lead to efficient plan recognition algorithms. We demonstrate the usefulness of the AHMM framework via a behaviour recognition system in a complex spatial environment using distributed video surveillance data.",0
"A first-order conditional logic is considered, with semantics given by a variant of epsilon-semantics, where p -&gt; q means that Pr(q | p) approaches 1 super-polynomially --faster than any inverse polynomial. This type of convergence is needed for reasoning about security protocols. A complete axiomatization is provided for this semantics, and it is shown how a qualitative proof of the correctness of a security protocol can be automatically converted to a quantitative proof appropriate for reasoning about concrete security.",1
"LAMA is a classical planning system based on heuristic forward search. Its core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic derived from landmarks, propositional formulas that must be true in every solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather than binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search is used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner continues to search for plans of better quality until the search is terminated. LAMA showed best performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the International Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we present the system in detail and investigate which features of LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition, demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using landmarks improves performance, whereas the incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to deal with action costs more effectively in the future. The iterated weighted A* search greatly improves results, and shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.",0
"Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) is a powerful framework for representing and solving distributed combinatorial problems, where the variables of the problem are owned by different agents. Many multi-agent problems include constraints that produce different gains (or costs) for the participating agents. Asymmetric gains of constrained agents cannot be naturally represented by the standard DCOP model. The present paper proposes a general framework for Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs). In ADCOPs different agents may have different valuations for constraints that they are involved in. The new framework bridges the gap between multi-agent problems which tend to have asymmetric structure and the standard symmetric DCOP model. The benefits of the proposed model over previous attempts to generalize the DCOP model are discussed and evaluated. Innovative algorithms that apply to the special properties of the proposed ADCOP model are presented in detail. These include complete algorithms that have a substantial advantage in terms of runtime and network load over existing algorithms (for standard DCOPs) which use alternative representations. Moreover, standard incomplete algorithms (i.e., local search algorithms) are inapplicable to the existing DCOP representations of asymmetric constraints and when they are applied to the new ADCOP framework they often fail to converge to a local optimum and yield poor results. The local search algorithms proposed in the present paper converge to high quality solutions. The experimental evidence that is presented reveals that the proposed local search algorithms for ADCOPs achieve high quality solutions while preserving a high level of privacy.",0
"The combination of multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has made a significant impact in various research fields. The UCT algorithm, which combines the UCB bandit algorithm with MCTS, is a good example of the success of this combination. The recent breakthrough made by AlphaGo, which incorporates convolutional neural networks with bandit algorithms in MCTS, also highlights the necessity of bandit algorithms in MCTS. However, despite the various investigations carried out on MCTS, nearly all of them still follow the paradigm of treating every node as an independent instance of the MAB problem, and applying the same bandit algorithm and heuristics on every node. As a result, this paradigm may leave some properties of the game tree unexploited. In this work, we propose that max nodes and min nodes have different concerns regarding their value estimation, and different bandit algorithms should be applied accordingly. We develop the Asymmetric-MCTS algorithm, which is an MCTS variant that applies a simple regret algorithm on max nodes, and the UCB algorithm on min nodes. We will demonstrate the performance of the Asymmetric-MCTS algorithm on the game of $9\times 9$ Go, $9\times 9$ NoGo, and Othello.",0
"Many problems, especially those with a composite structure, can naturally be expressed in higher order logic. From a KR perspective modeling these problems in an intuitive way is a challenging task. In this paper we study the graph mining problem as an example of a higher order problem. In short, this problem asks us to find a graph that frequently occurs as a subgraph among a set of example graphs. We start from the problem's mathematical definition to solve it in three state-of-the-art specification systems. For IDP and ASP, which have no native support for higher order logic, we propose the use of encoding techniques such as the disjoint union technique and the saturation technique. ProB benefits from the higher order support for sets. We compare the performance of the three approaches to get an idea of the overhead of the higher order support.",0
"In this paper a new heuristic optimization algorithm has been introduced based on the performance of the major football leagues within each season in EU countries. The algorithm starts with an initial population including three different groups of teams: the wealthiest (strongest), the regular, the poorest (weakest). Each individual of population constitute a football team while each player is an indication of a player in a post. The optimization can hopefully occurs when the competition among the teams in all the leagues is imitated as the strongest teams usually purchase the best players of the regular teams and in turn, regular teams purchase the best players of the weakest who should always discover young players instead of buying professionals. It has been shown that the algorithm can hopefully converge to an acceptable solution solving various benchmarks. Key words: Heuristic Algorithms",0
"Chain graphs combine directed and undirected graphs and their underlying mathematics combines properties of the two. This paper gives a simplified definition of chain graphs based on a hierarchical combination of Bayesian (directed) and Markov (undirected) networks. Examples of a chain graph are multivariate feed-forward networks, clustering with conditional interaction between variables, and forms of Bayes classifiers. Chain graphs are then extended using the notation of plates so that samples and data analysis problems can be represented in a graphical model as well. Implications for learning are discussed in the conclusion.",0
"Many studies in heuristic search suggest that the accuracy of the heuristic used has a positive impact on improving the performance of the search. In another direction, historical research perceives that the performance of heuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, can be improved by requiring the heuristics to be consistent -- a property satisfied by any perfect heuristic. However, a few recent studies show that inconsistent heuristics can also be used to achieve a large improvement in these heuristic search algorithms. These results leave us a natural question: which property of heuristics, accuracy or consistency/inconsistency, should we focus on when building heuristics? While there are studies on the heuristic accuracy with the assumption of consistency, no studies on both the inconsistency and the accuracy of heuristics are known to our knowledge.",0
"Reactive (memoryless) policies are sufficient in completely observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), but some kind of memory is usually necessary for optimal control of a partially observable MDP. Policies with finite memory can be represented as finite-state automata. In this paper, we extend Baird and Moore's VAPS algorithm to the problem of learning general finite-state automata. Because it performs stochastic gradient descent, this algorithm can be shown to converge to a locally optimal finite-state controller. We provide the details of the algorithm and then consider the question of under what conditions stochastic gradient descent will outperform exact gradient descent. We conclude with empirical results comparing the performance of stochastic and exact gradient descent, and showing the ability of our algorithm to extract the useful information contained in the sequence of past observations to compensate for the lack of observability at each time-step.",0
"Web space is the huge repository of data. Everyday lots of new information get added to this web space. The more the information, more is demand for tools to access that information. Answering users' queries about the online information intelligently is one of the great challenges in information retrieval in intelligent systems. In this paper, we will start with the brief introduction on information retrieval and intelligent systems and explain how swoogle, the semantic search engine, uses its algorithms and techniques to search for the desired contents in the web. We then continue with the clustering technique that is used to group the similar things together and discuss the machine learning technique called Self-organizing maps [6] or SOM, which is a data visualization technique that reduces the dimensions of data through the use of self-organizing neural networks. We then discuss how SOM is used to visualize the contents of the data, by following some lines of algorithm, in the form of maps. So, we could say that websites or machines can be used to retrieve the information that what exactly users want from them.",0
"The minimum common string partition problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in computational biology. In this work we propose the first integer linear programming model for solving this problem. Moreover, on the basis of the integer linear programming model we develop a deterministic 2-phase heuristic which is applicable to larger problem instances. The results show that provenly optimal solutions can be obtained for problem instances of small and medium size from the literature by solving the proposed integer linear programming model with CPLEX. Furthermore, new best-known solutions are obtained for all considered problem instances from the literature. Concerning the heuristic, we were able to show that it outperforms heuristic competitors from the related literature.",0
"It is well-known that inference in graphical models is hard in the worst case, but tractable for models with bounded treewidth. We ask whether treewidth is the only structural criterion of the underlying graph that enables tractable inference. In other words, is there some class of structures with unbounded treewidth in which inference is tractable? Subject to a combinatorial hypothesis due to Robertson et al. (1994), we show that low treewidth is indeed the only structural restriction that can ensure tractability. Thus, even for the ""best case"" graph structure, there is no inference algorithm with complexity polynomial in the treewidth.",0
"An Intelligent Personal Agent (IPA) is an agent that has the purpose of helping the user to gain information through reliable resources with the help of knowledge navigation techniques and saving time to search the best content. The agent is also responsible for responding to the chat-based queries with the help of Conversation Corpus. We will be testing different methods for optimal query generation. To felicitate the ease of usage of the application, the agent will be able to accept the input through Text (Keyboard), Voice (Speech Recognition) and Server (Facebook) and output responses using the same method. Existing chat bots reply by making changes in the input, but we will give responses based on multiple SRT files. The model will learn using the human dialogs dataset and will be able respond human-like. Responses to queries about famous things (places, people, and words) can be provided using web scraping which will enable the bot to have knowledge navigation features. The agent will even learn from its past experiences supporting semi-supervised learning.",0
"We investigate different approaches to integrating object recognition and planning in a tabletop manipulation domain with the set of objects used in the 2012 RoboCup@Work competition. Results of our preliminary experiments show that, with some approaches, close integration of perception and planning improves the quality of plans, as well as the computation times of feasible plans.",0
"A Behavior Tree (BT) is a way to structure the switching between different tasks in an autonomous agent, such as a robot or a virtual entity in a computer game. BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that are both modular and reactive. These properties are crucial in many applications, which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming to many branches of AI and Robotics. In this book, we will first give an introduction to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to, and in many cases generalize, earlier switching structures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. Properties such as safety, robustness, and efficiency are important for an autonomous system, and we describe a set of tools for formally analyzing these using a state space description of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches. Finally, we describe an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion.",0
"We propose an approach to build a neural machine translation system with no supervised resources (i.e., no parallel corpora) using multimodal embedded representation over texts and images. Based on the assumption that text documents are often likely to be described with other multimedia information (e.g., images) somewhat related to the content, we try to indirectly estimate the relevance between two languages. Using multimedia as the ""pivot"", we project all modalities into one common hidden space where samples belonging to similar semantic concepts should come close to each other, whatever the observed space of each sample is. This modality-agnostic representation is the key to bridging the gap between different modalities. Putting a decoder on top of it, our network can flexibly draw the outputs from any input modality. Notably, in the testing phase, we need only source language texts as the input for translation. In experiments, we tested our method on two benchmarks to show that it can achieve reasonable translation performance. We compared and investigated several possible implementations and found that an end-to-end model that simultaneously optimized both rank loss in multimodal encoders and cross-entropy loss in decoders performed the best.",0
"This is the first of three planned papers describing ZAP, a satisfiability engine that substantially generalizes existing tools while retaining the performance characteristics of modern high-performance solvers. The fundamental idea underlying ZAP is that many problems passed to such engines contain rich internal structure that is obscured by the Boolean representation used; our goal is to define a representation in which this structure is apparent and can easily be exploited to improve computational performance. This paper is a survey of the work underlying ZAP, and discusses previous attempts to improve the performance of the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm by exploiting the structure of the problem being solved. We examine existing ideas including extensions of the Boolean language to allow cardinality constraints, pseudo-Boolean representations, symmetry, and a limited form of quantification. While this paper is intended as a survey, our research results are contained in the two subsequent articles, with the theoretical structure of ZAP described in the second paper in this series, and ZAP's implementation described in the third.",0
"We introduce a technique to produce discriminative context-aware image captions (captions that describe differences between images or visual concepts) using only generic context-agnostic training data (captions that describe a concept or an image in isolation). For example, given images and captions of ""siamese cat"" and ""tiger cat"", our system generates language that describes the ""siamese cat"" in a way that distinguishes it from ""tiger cat"". We start with a generic language model that is context-agnostic and add a listener to discriminate between closely-related concepts. Our approach offers two key advantages over previous work: 1) our listener does not need separate training, and 2) allows joint inference to decode sentences that satisfy both the speaker and listener -- yielding an introspective speaker. We first apply our introspective speaker to a justification task, i.e. to describe why an image contains a particular fine-grained category as opposed to another closely related category in the CUB-200-2011 dataset. We then study discriminative image captioning to generate language that uniquely refers to one out of two semantically similar images in the COCO dataset. Evaluations with discriminative ground truth for justification and human studies for discriminative image captioning reveal that our approach outperforms baseline generative and speaker-listener approaches for discrimination.",0
"This paper describes a number of distributed forward search algorithms for solving multi-agent planning problems. We introduce a distributed formulation of non-optimal forward search, as well as an optimal version, MAD-A*. Our algorithms exploit the structure of multi-agent problems to not only distribute the work efficiently among different agents, but also to remove symmetries and reduce the overall workload. The algorithms ensure that private information is not shared among agents, yet computation is still efficient -- outperforming current state-of-the-art distributed planners, and in some cases even centralized search -- despite the fact that each agent has access only to partial information.",0
"In this paper, we propose an algebraic similarity measure {\sigma}BS (BS stands for BitSim) for assigning semantic similarity score to concept definitions in ALCH+ an expressive fragment of Description Logics (DL). We define an algebraic interpretation function, I_B, that maps a concept definition to a unique string ({\omega}_B) called bit-code) over an alphabet {\Sigma}_B of 11 symbols belonging to L_B - the language over P B. IB has semantic correspondence with conventional model-theoretic interpretation of DL. We then define {\sigma}_BS on L_B. A detailed analysis of I_B and {\sigma}_BS has been given.",0
"In recent years prominent intellectuals have raised ethical concerns about the consequences of artificial intelligence. One concern is that an autonomous agent might modify itself to become ""superintelligent"" and, in supremely effective pursuit of poorly specified goals, destroy all of humanity. This paper considers and rejects the possibility of this outcome. We argue that this scenario depends on an agent's ability to rapidly improve its ability to predict its environment through self-modification. Using a Bayesian model of a reasoning agent, we show that there are important limitations to how an agent may improve its predictive ability through self-modification alone. We conclude that concern about this artificial intelligence outcome is misplaced and better directed at policy questions around data access and storage.",0
"Ambient Intelligence aims to offer personalized services and easier ways of interaction between people and systems. Since several users and systems may coexist in these environments, it is quite possible that entities with opposing preferences need to cooperate to reach their respective goals. Automated negotiation is pointed as one of the mechanisms that may provide a solution to this kind of problems. In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining model for Ambient Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that agents have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents' preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation models that obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational cost low. A niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation process to sample one's own utility function (self-sampling). During the negotiation process, genetic operators are applied over the opponent's and one's own offers in order to sample new offers that are interesting for both parties. Results show that the proposed model is capable of outperforming similarity heuristics which only sample before the negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to similarity heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers.",0
"Given that semantic Web realization is based on the critical mass of metadata accessibility and the representation of data with formal knowledge, it needs to generate metadata that is specific, easy to understand and well-defined. However, semantic annotation of the web documents is the successful way to make the Semantic Web vision a reality. This paper introduces the Semantic Web and its vision (stack layers) with regard to some concept definitions that helps the understanding of semantic annotation. Additionally, this paper introduces the semantic annotation categories, tools, domains and models.",0
"This paper reports the activities and outcomes in the Workshop on Grasping and Manipulation Datasets that was organized under the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2016. The half day workshop was packed with nine invited talks, 12 interactive presentations, and one panel discussion with ten panelists. This paper summarizes all the talks and presentations and recaps what has been discussed in the panels session. This summary servers as a review of recent developments in data collection in grasping and manipulation. Many of the presentations describe ongoing efforts or explorations that could be achieved and fully available in a year or two. The panel discussion not only commented on the current approaches, but also indicates new directions and focuses. The workshop clearly displayed the importance of quality datasets in robotics and robotic grasping and manipulation field. Hopefully the workshop could motivate larger efforts to create big datasets that are comparable with big datasets in other communities such as computer vision.",0
"One difficulty faced in knowledge engineering for Bayesian Network (BN) is the quan-tification step where the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are determined. The number of parameters included in CPTs increases exponentially with the number of parent variables. The most common solution is the application of the so-called canonical gates. The Noisy-OR (NOR) gate, which takes advantage of the independence of causal interactions, provides a logarithmic reduction of the number of parameters required to specify a CPT. In this paper, an extension of NOR model based on the theory of belief functions, named Belief Noisy-OR (BNOR), is proposed. BNOR is capable of dealing with both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty of the network. Compared with NOR, more rich information which is of great value for making decisions can be got when the available knowledge is uncertain. Specially, when there is no epistemic uncertainty, BNOR degrades into NOR. Additionally, different structures of BNOR are presented in this paper in order to meet various needs of engineers. The application of BNOR model on the reliability evaluation problem of networked systems demonstrates its effectiveness.",0
"Humans are generally good at learning abstract concepts about objects and scenes (e.g.\ spatial orientation, relative sizes, etc.). Over the last years convolutional neural networks have achieved almost human performance in recognizing concrete classes (i.e.\ specific object categories). This paper tests the performance of a current CNN (GoogLeNet) on the task of differentiating between abstract classes which are trivially differentiable for humans. We trained and tested the CNN on the two abstract classes of horizontal and vertical orientation and determined how well the network is able to transfer the learned classes to other, previously unseen objects.",0
"There is a vast supply of prior art that study models for mental processes. Some studies in psychology and philosophy approach it from an inner perspective in terms of experiences and percepts. Others such as neurobiology or connectionist-machines approach it externally by viewing the mind as complex circuit of neurons where each neuron is a primitive binary circuit. In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then builds up incrementally in a bottom up fashion. A new node is formed by a simple composition of prior nodes when we undergo a repeated experience that can be described by that composition. Unlike neural networks, however, these circuits take ""concepts"" or ""percepts"" as inputs and outputs. Thus the growing circuits can be likened to a growing collection of lambda expressions that are built on top of one another in an attempt to compress the sensory input as a heuristic to bound its Kolmogorov Complexity.",0
"An important issue in public goods game is whether player's behaviour changes over time, and if so, how significant it is. In this game players can be classified into different groups according to the level of their participation in the public good. This problem can be considered as a concept drift problem by asking the amount of change that happens to the clusters of players over a sequence of game rounds. In this study we present a method for measuring changes in clusters with the same items over discrete time points using external clustering validation indices and area under the curve. External clustering indices were originally used to measure the difference between suggested clusters in terms of clustering algorithms and ground truth labels for items provided by experts. Instead of different cluster label comparison, we use these indices to compare between clusters of any two consecutive time points or between the first time point and the remaining time points to measure the difference between clusters through time points. In theory, any external clustering indices can be used to measure changes for any traditional (non-temporal) clustering algorithm, due to the fact that any time point alone is not carrying any temporal information. For the public goods game, our results indicate that the players are changing over time but the change is smooth and relatively constant between any two time points.",0
"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a recently proposed class of generative models in which a generator is trained to optimize a cost function that is being simultaneously learned by a discriminator. While the idea of learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling, learning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL) domains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields, learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the connection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling may appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we demonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy IRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided as an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL is a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of GANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this interpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By formally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that researchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable ideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and scalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.",0
"We present a novel and scalable label embedding framework for large-scale multi-label learning a.k.a ExMLDS (Extreme Multi-Label Learning using Distributional Semantics). Our approach draws inspiration from ideas rooted in distributional semantics, specifically the Skip Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) approach, widely used to learn word embeddings for natural language processing tasks. Learning such embeddings can be reduced to a certain matrix factorization. Our approach is novel in that it highlights interesting connections between label embedding methods used for multi-label learning and paragraph/document embedding methods commonly used for learning representations of text data. The framework can also be easily extended to incorporate auxiliary information such as label-label correlations; this is crucial especially when there are a lot of missing labels in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive set of experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed learning methods perform favorably compared to several baselines and state-of-the-art methods for large-scale multi-label learning.",0
"In this paper we present a propositional logic programming language for reasoning under possibilistic uncertainty and representing vague knowledge. Formulas are represented by pairs (A, c), where A is a many-valued proposition and c is value in the unit interval [0,1] which denotes a lower bound on the belief on A in terms of necessity measures. Belief states are modeled by possibility distributions on the set of all many-valued interpretations. In this framework, (i) we define a syntax and a semantics of the general underlying uncertainty logic; (ii) we provide a modus ponens-style calculus for a sublanguage of Horn-rules and we prove that it is complete for determining the maximum degree of possibilistic belief with which a fuzzy propositional variable can be entailed from a set of formulas; and finally, (iii) we show how the computation of a partial matching between fuzzy propositional variables, in terms of necessity measures for fuzzy sets, can be included in our logic programming system.",0
"In this dissertation, we analyze the computational properties of game-theoretic centrality measures. The key idea behind game-theoretic approach to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties. Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in polynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues. Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse computational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which order of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called generalized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial computation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of the Shapley value to this class of games.",0
"Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish command and control (C&amp;C) connections. While there are many methods to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible means to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce names of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat blind to new DGA variants.",0
"We claim that it is possible to have artificial software agents for which their actions and the world they inhabit have first-person or intrinsic meanings. The first-person or intrinsic meaning of an entity to a system is defined as its relation with the system's goals and capabilities, given the properties of the environment in which it operates. Therefore, for a system to develop first-person meanings, it must see itself as a goal-directed actor, facing limitations and opportunities dictated by its own capabilities, and by the properties of the environment. The first part of the paper discusses this claim in the context of arguments against and proposals addressing the development of computer programs with first-person meanings. A set of definitions is also presented, most importantly the concepts of cold and phenomenal first-person meanings. The second part of the paper presents preliminary proposals and achievements, resulting of actual software implementations, within a research approach that aims to develop software agents that intrinsically understand their actions and what happens to them. As a result, an agent with no a priori notion of its goals and capabilities, and of the properties of its environment acquires all these notions by observing itself in action. The cold first-person meanings of the agent's actions and of what happens to it are defined using these acquired notions. Although not solving the full problem of first-person meanings, the proposed approach and preliminary results allow us some confidence to address the problems yet to be considered, in particular the phenomenal aspect of first-person meanings.",0
"We show that if a strictly positive joint probability distribution for a set of binary random variables factors according to a tree, then vertex separation represents all and only the independence relations enclosed in the distribution. The same result is shown to hold also for multivariate strictly positive normal distributions. Our proof uses a new property of conditional independence that holds for these two classes of probability distributions.",0
"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) continue to show outstanding performance in sequence modeling tasks. However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph. This model can also be encouraged to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model on various tasks and show how it can reduce the number of required RNN updates while preserving, and sometimes even improving, the performance of the baseline RNN models. Source code is publicly available at",0
"In this paper, we reexamine the Movie Graph Argument, which demonstrates a basic incompatibility between computationalism and materialism. We discover that the incompatibility is only manifest in singular classical-like universes. If we accept that we live in a Multiverse, then the incompatibility goes away, but in that case another line of argument shows that with computationalism, the fundamental, or primitive materiality has no causal influence on what is observed, which must must be derivable from basic arithmetic properties.",0
"We are interested in the problem of planning for factored POMDPs. Building on the recent results of Kearns, Mansour and Ng, we provide a planning algorithm for factored POMDPs that exploits the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in the belief state simplification introduced by Boyen and Koller.",0
"Qualitative probabilistic networks have been introduced as qualitative abstractions of Bayesian belief networks. One of the major drawbacks of these qualitative networks is their coarse level of detail, which may lead to unresolved trade-offs during inference. We present an enhanced formalism for qualitative networks with a finer level of detail. An enhanced qualitative probabilistic network differs from a regular qualitative network in that it distinguishes between strong and weak influences. Enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks are purely qualitative in nature, as regular qualitative networks are, yet allow for efficiently resolving trade-offs during inference.",0
"In this paper, we introduce a notion of backdoors to Reiter's propositional default logic and study structural properties of it. Also we consider the problems of backdoor detection (parameterised by the solution size) as well as backdoor evaluation (parameterised by the size of the given backdoor), for various kinds of target classes (cnf, horn, krom, monotone, identity). We show that backdoor detection is fixed-parameter tractable for the considered target classes, and backdoor evaluation is either fixed-parameter tractable, in para-DP2 , or in para-NP, depending on the target class.",0
In this paper we explore various parameter settings of the state-of-art Statistical Machine Translation system to improve the quality of the translation for a `distant' language pair like English-Hindi. We proposed new techniques for efficient reordering. A slight improvement over the baseline is reported using these techniques. We also show that a simple pre-processing step can improve the quality of the translation significantly.,0
"Many approaches for estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a machine, using its operational sensor data, make assumptions about how a system degrades or a fault evolves, e.g., exponential degradation. However, in many domains degradation may not follow a pattern. We propose a Long Short Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) scheme to obtain an unsupervised health index (HI) for a system using multi-sensor time-series data. LSTM-ED is trained to reconstruct the time-series corresponding to healthy state of a system. The reconstruction error is used to compute HI which is then used for RUL estimation. We evaluate our approach on publicly available Turbofan Engine and Milling Machine datasets. We also present results on a real-world industry dataset from a pulverizer mill where we find significant correlation between LSTM-ED based HI and maintenance costs.",0
"Whereas acausal Bayesian networks represent probabilistic independence, causal Bayesian networks represent causal relationships. In this paper, we examine Bayesian methods for learning both types of networks. Bayesian methods for learning acausal networks are fairly well developed. These methods often employ assumptions to facilitate the construction of priors, including the assumptions of parameter independence, parameter modularity, and likelihood equivalence. We show that although these assumptions also can be appropriate for learning causal networks, we need additional assumptions in order to learn causal networks. We introduce two sufficient assumptions, called {em mechanism independence} and {em component independence}. We show that these new assumptions, when combined with parameter independence, parameter modularity, and likelihood equivalence, allow us to apply methods for learning acausal networks to learn causal networks.",0
"The ""easy"" problem of cognitive science is explaining how and why we can do what we can do. The ""hard"" problem is explaining how and why we feel. Turing's methodology for cognitive science (the Turing Test) is based on doing: Design a model that can do anything a human can do, indistinguishably from a human, to a human, and you have explained cognition. Searle has shown that the successful model cannot be solely computational. Sensory-motor robotic capacities are necessary to ground some, at least, of the model's words, in what the robot can do with the things in the world that the words are about. But even grounding is not enough to guarantee that -- nor to explain how and why -- the model feels (if it does). That problem is much harder to solve (and perhaps insoluble).",0
"There has been a long history of using fuzzy language equivalence to compare the behavior of fuzzy systems, but the comparison at this level is too coarse. Recently, a finer behavioral measure, bisimulation, has been introduced to fuzzy finite automata. However, the results obtained are applicable only to finite-state systems. In this paper, we consider bisimulation for general fuzzy systems which may be infinite-state or infinite-event, by modeling them as fuzzy transition systems. To help understand and check bisimulation, we characterize it in three ways by enumerating whole transitions, comparing individual transitions, and using a monotonic function. In addition, we address composition operations, subsystems, quotients, and homomorphisms of fuzzy transition systems and discuss their properties connected with bisimulation. The results presented here are useful for comparing the behavior of general fuzzy systems. In particular, this makes it possible to relate an infinite fuzzy system to a finite one, which is easier to analyze, with the same behavior.",0
"Accuracy and interpretation are two goals of any successful predictive models. Most existing works have to suffer the tradeoff between the two by either picking complex black box models such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) or relying on less accurate traditional models with better interpretation such as logistic regression. To address this dilemma, we present REverse Time AttentIoN model (RETAIN) for analyzing EHR data that achieves high accuracy while remaining clinically interpretable. RETAIN is a two-level neural attention model that can find influential past visits and significant clinical variables within those visits (e.g,. key diagnoses). RETAIN mimics physician practice by attending the EHR data in a reverse time order so that more recent clinical visits will likely get higher attention. Experiments on a large real EHR dataset of 14 million visits from 263K patients over 8 years confirmed the comparable predictive accuracy and computational scalability to the state-of-the-art methods such as RNN. Finally, we demonstrate the clinical interpretation with concrete examples from RETAIN.",1
"Ensuring the security of computers is a non-trivial task, with many techniques used by malicious users to compromise these systems. In recent years a new threat has emerged in the form of networks of hijacked zombie machines used to perform complex distributed attacks such as denial of service and to obtain sensitive data such as password information. These zombie machines are said to be infected with a 'bot' - a malicious piece of software which is installed on a host machine and is controlled by a remote attacker, termed the 'botmaster of a botnet'. In this work, we use the biologically inspired Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) to detect the existence of a single bot on a compromised host machine. The DCA is an immune-inspired algorithm based on an abstract model of the behaviour of the dendritic cells of the human body. The basis of anomaly detection performed by the DCA is facilitated using the correlation of behavioural attributes such as keylogging and packet flooding behaviour. The results of the application of the DCA to the detection of a single bot show that the algorithm is a successful technique for the detection of such malicious software without responding to normally running programs.",0
"Plan recognition aims to discover target plans (i.e., sequences of actions) behind observed actions, with history plan libraries or domain models in hand. Previous approaches either discover plans by maximally ""matching"" observed actions to plan libraries, assuming target plans are from plan libraries, or infer plans by executing domain models to best explain the observed actions, assuming complete domain models are available. In real world applications, however, target plans are often not from plan libraries and complete domain models are often not available, since building complete sets of plans and complete domain models are often difficult or expensive. In this paper we view plan libraries as corpora and learn vector representations of actions using the corpora; we then discover target plans based on the vector representations. Our approach is capable of discovering underlying plans that are not from plan libraries, without requiring domain models provided. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance to traditional plan recognition approaches in three planning domains.",0

"In this thesis we present a new algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem called the Enhanced Bees Algorithm. It is adapted from a fairly recent algorithm, the Bees Algorithm, which was developed for continuous optimisation problems. We show that the results obtained by the Enhanced Bees Algorithm are competitive with the best meta-heuristics available for the Vehicle Routing Problem (within 0.5% of the optimal solution for common benchmark problems). We show that the algorithm has good runtime performance, producing results within 2% of the optimal solution within 60 seconds, making it suitable for use within real world dispatch scenarios.",0
"In this work we establish and investigate connections between causes for query answers in databases, database repairs wrt. denial constraints, and consistency-based diagnosis. The first two are relatively new research areas in databases, and the third one is an established subject in knowledge representation. We show how to obtain database repairs from causes, and the other way around. Causality problems are formulated as diagnosis problems, and the diagnoses provide causes and their responsibilities. The vast body of research on database repairs can be applied to the newer problems of computing actual causes for query answers and their responsibilities. These connections, which are interesting per se, allow us, after a transition -inspired by consistency-based diagnosis- to computational problems on hitting sets and vertex covers in hypergraphs, to obtain several new algorithmic and complexity results for database causality.",0
"Boolean satisfiability (SAT) has an extensive application domain in computer science, especially in electronic design automation applications. Circuit synthesis, optimization, and verification problems can be solved by transforming original problems to SAT problems. However, the SAT problem is known as NP-complete, which means there is no efficient method to solve it. Therefore, an efficient SAT solver to enhance the performance is always desired. We propose a hardware acceleration method for SAT problems. By surveying the properties of SAT problems and the decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, a special class of error-correcting codes, we discover that both of them are constraint satisfaction problems. The belief propagation algorithm has been successfully applied to the decoding of LDPC, and the corresponding decoder hardware designs are extensively studied. Therefore, we proposed a belief propagation based algorithm to solve SAT problems. With this algorithm, the SAT solver can be accelerated by hardware. A software simulator is implemented to verify the proposed algorithm and the performance improvement is estimated. Our experiment results show that time complexity does not increase with the size of SAT problems and the proposed method can achieve at least 30x speedup compared to MiniSat.",0
"Results are presented on the performance of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system (ANFIS) for wind velocity forecasts in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. The data bank was provided by the meteorological station located at the University of Isthmus, Tehuantepec campus, and this data bank covers the period from 2008 to 2011. Three data models were constructed to carry out 16, 24 and 48 hours forecasts using the following variables: wind velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, and date. The performance measure for the three models is the mean standard error (MSE). In this work, performance analysis in short-term prediction is presented, because it is essential in order to define an adequate wind speed model for eolian parks, where a right planning provide economic benefits.",0
"A set $S$ is linearly separable if each $x\in S$ can be separated from the rest of $S$ by a linear functional. We study random $N$-element sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for large $n$ and demonstrate that for $N&lt;a\exp(b{n})$ they are linearly separable with probability $p$, $p&gt;1-\vartheta$, for a given (small) $\vartheta&gt;0$. Constants $a,b&gt;0$ depend on the probability distribution and the constant $\vartheta$. The results are important for machine learning in high dimension, especially for correction of unavoidable mistakes of legacy Artificial Intelligence systems.",0
"LP relaxation-based message passing algorithms provide an effective tool for MAP inference over Probabilistic Graphical Models. However, different LP relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing dimensions, which presents a barrier to effective comparison and analysis. In addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows quickly with the number of constraints. Reducing the number of constraints without sacrificing the quality of the solutions is thus desirable.",0
"This papers shows that using separators, which is a pair of two complementary contractors, we can easily and efficiently solve the localization problem of a robot with sonar measurements in an unstructured environment. We introduce separators associated with the Minkowski sum and the Minkowski difference in order to facilitate the resolution. A test-case is given in order to illustrate the principle of the approach.",0
"In this paper, we present a Neural Aggregation Network (NAN) for video face recognition. The network takes a face video or face image set of a person with variable number of face frames as its input, and produces a compact and fixed-dimension visual representation of that person. The whole network is composed of two modules. The feature embedding module is a CNN which maps each face frame into a feature representation. The neural aggregation module is composed of two content based attention blocks which is driven by a memory storing all the features extracted from the face video through the feature embedding module. The output of the first attention block adapts the second, whose output is adopted as the aggregated representation of the video faces. Due to the attention mechanism, this representation is invariant to the order of the face frames. The experiments show that the proposed NAN consistently outperforms hand-crafted aggregations such as average pooling, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three video face recognition datasets: the YouTube Face, IJB-A and Celebrity-1000 datasets.",0
"Searching the complete space of possible Bayesian networks is intractable for problems of interesting size, so Bayesian network structure learning algorithms, such as the commonly used Sparse Candidate algorithm, employ heuristics. However, these heuristics also restrict the types of relationships that can be learned exclusively from data. They are unable to learn relationships that exhibit ""correlation-immunity"", such as parity. To learn Bayesian networks in the presence of correlation-immune relationships, we extend the Sparse Candidate algorithm with a technique called ""skewing"". This technique uses the observation that relationships that are correlation-immune under a specific input distribution may not be correlation-immune under another, sufficiently different distribution. We show that by extending Sparse Candidate with this technique we are able to discover relationships between random variables that are approximately correlation-immune, with a significantly lower computational cost than the alternative of considering multiple parents of a node at a time.",0
"We present a distributed anytime algorithm for performing MAP inference in graphical models. The problem is formulated as a linear programming relaxation over the edges of a graph. The resulting program has a constraint structure that allows application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle. Subprograms are defined over individual edges and can be computed in a distributed manner. This accommodates solutions to graphs whose state space does not fit in memory. The decomposition master program is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations, while the solution converges monotonically with each iteration. Formulating the MAP inference problem as a linear program allows additional (global) constraints to be defined; something not possible with message passing algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm's solution quality outperforms most current algorithms and it scales well to large problems.",0
"At the heart of many scientific conferences is the problem of matching submitted papers to suitable reviewers. Arriving at a good assignment is a major and important challenge for any conference organizer. In this paper we propose a framework to optimize paper-to-reviewer assignments. Our framework uses suitability scores to measure pairwise affinity between papers and reviewers. We show how learning can be used to infer suitability scores from a small set of provided scores, thereby reducing the burden on reviewers and organizers. We frame the assignment problem as an integer program and propose several variations for the paper-to-reviewer matching domain. We also explore how learning and matching interact. Experiments on two conference data sets examine the performance of several learning methods as well as the effectiveness of the matching formulations.",0
"Network complexity is increasing, making network control and orchestration a challenging task. The proliferation of network information and tools for data analytics can provide an important insight into resource provisioning and optimisation. The network knowledge incorporated in software defined networking can facilitate the knowledge driven control, leveraging the network programmability. We present Seer: a flexible, highly configurable data analytics platform for network intelligence based on software defined networking and big data principles. Seer combines a computational engine with a distributed messaging system to provide a scalable, fault tolerant and real-time platform for knowledge extraction. Our first prototype uses Apache Spark for streaming analytics and open network operating system (ONOS) controller to program a network in real-time. The first application we developed aims to predict the mobility pattern of mobile devices inside a smart city environment.",0
"Controlling embodied agents with many actuated degrees of freedom is a challenging task. We propose a method that can discover and interpolate between context dependent high-level actions or body-affordances. These provide an abstract, low-dimensional interface indexing high-dimensional and time- extended action policies. Our method is related to recent ap- proaches in the machine learning literature but is conceptually simpler and easier to implement. More specifically our method requires the choice of a n-dimensional target sensor space that is endowed with a distance metric. The method then learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.",0
"Retrieval tasks typically require a ranking of items given a query. Collaborative filtering tasks, on the other hand, learn to model user's preferences over items. In this paper we study the joint problem of recommending items to a user with respect to a given query, which is a surprisingly common task. This setup differs from the standard collaborative filtering one in that we are given a query x user x item tensor for training instead of the more traditional user x item matrix. Compared to document retrieval we do have a query, but we may or may not have content features (we will consider both cases) and we can also take account of the user's profile. We introduce a factorized model for this new task that optimizes the top-ranked items returned for the given query and user. We report empirical results where it outperforms several baselines.",1
"From the advent of the application of satellite imagery to land cover mapping, one of the growing areas of research interest has been in the area of image classification. Image classifiers are algorithms used to extract land cover information from satellite imagery. Most of the initial research has focussed on the development and application of algorithms to better existing and emerging classifiers. In this paper, a paradigm shift is proposed whereby a committee of classifiers is used to determine the final classification output. Two of the key components of an ensemble system are that there should be diversity among the classifiers and that there should be a mechanism through which the results are combined. In this paper, the members of the ensemble system include: Linear SVM, Gaussian SVM and Quadratic SVM. The final output was determined through a simple majority vote of the individual classifiers. From the results obtained it was observed that the final derived map generated by an ensemble system can potentially improve on the results derived from the individual classifiers making up the ensemble system. The ensemble system classification accuracy was, in this case, better than the linear and quadratic SVM result. It was however less than that of the RBF SVM. Areas for further research could focus on improving the diversity of the ensemble system used in this research.",0
"Different notions of equivalence, such as the prominent notions of strong and uniform equivalence, have been studied in Answer-Set Programming, mainly for the purpose of identifying programs that can serve as substitutes without altering the semantics, for instance in program optimization. Such semantic comparisons are usually characterized by various selections of models in the logic of Here-and-There (HT). For uniform equivalence however, correct characterizations in terms of HT-models can only be obtained for finite theories, respectively programs. In this article, we show that a selection of countermodels in HT captures uniform equivalence also for infinite theories. This result is turned into coherent characterizations of the different notions of equivalence by countermodels, as well as by a mixture of HT-models and countermodels (so-called equivalence interpretations). Moreover, we generalize the so-called notion of relativized hyperequivalence for programs to propositional theories, and apply the same methodology in order to obtain a semantic characterization which is amenable to infinite settings. This allows for a lifting of the results to first-order theories under a very general semantics given in terms of a quantified version of HT. We thus obtain a general framework for the study of various notions of equivalence for theories under answer-set semantics. Moreover, we prove an expedient property that allows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures, and provide further results for non-ground logic programs. In particular, uniform equivalence coincides under open and ordinary answer-set semantics, and for finite non-ground programs under these semantics, also the usual characterization of uniform equivalence in terms of maximal and total HT-models of the grounding is correct, even for infinite domains, when corresponding ground programs are infinite.",0
"This paper describes a domain-specific knowledge acquisition tool for intelligent automated troubleshooters based on Bayesian networks. No Bayesian network knowledge is required to use the tool, and troubleshooting information can be specified as natural and intuitive as possible. Probabilities can be specified in the direction that is most natural to the domain expert. Thus, the knowledge acquisition efficiently removes the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck of Bayesian networks.",0
"We present exact algorithms for identifying deterministic-actions effects and preconditions in dynamic partially observable domains. They apply when one does not know the action model(the way actions affect the world) of a domain and must learn it from partial observations over time. Such scenarios are common in real world applications. They are challenging for AI tasks because traditional domain structures that underly tractability (e.g., conditional independence) fail there (e.g., world features become correlated). Our work departs from traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models. In particular, it focuses on problems in which actions are deterministic of simple logical structure and observation models have all features observed with some frequency. We yield tractable algorithms for the modified problem for such domains.",0
"We present a new abductive, probabilistic theory of plan recognition. This model differs from previous plan recognition theories in being centered around a model of plan execution: most previous methods have been based on plans as formal objects or on rules describing the recognition process. We show that our new model accounts for phenomena omitted from most previous plan recognition theories: notably the cumulative effect of a sequence of observations of partially-ordered, interleaved plans and the effect of context on plan adoption. The model also supports inferences about the evolution of plan execution in situations where another agent intervenes in plan execution. This facility provides support for using plan recognition to build systems that will intelligently assist a user.",0
"We consider the discrete assignment problem in which agents express ordinal preferences over objects and these objects are allocated to the agents in a fair manner. We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments. The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied systematically for the fairness notions. We characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist. For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists or not. Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of variable entitlements of agents. Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of envy-freeness, answers an open problem posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang (ECAI 2010).",0
"Learning non-linear functions can be hard when the magnitude of the target function is unknown beforehand, as most learning algorithms are not scale invariant. We propose an algorithm to adaptively normalize these targets. This is complementary to recent advances in input normalization. Importantly, the proposed method preserves the unnormalized outputs whenever the normalization is updated to avoid instability caused by non-stationarity. It can be combined with any learning algorithm and any non-linear function approximation, including the important special case of deep learning. We empirically validate the method in supervised learning and reinforcement learning and apply it to learning how to play Atari 2600 games. Previous work on applying deep learning to this domain relied on clipping the rewards to make learning in different games more homogeneous, but this uses the domain-specific knowledge that in these games counting rewards is often almost as informative as summing these. Using our adaptive normalization we can remove this heuristic without diminishing overall performance, and even improve performance on some games, such as Ms. Pac-Man and Centipede, on which previous methods did not perform well.",1
"In this paper, we present a heuristic operator which aims at simultaneously optimizing the orientations of all the edges in an intermediate Bayesian network structure during the search process. This is done by alternating between the space of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and the space of skeletons. The found orientations of the edges are based on a scoring function rather than on induced conditional independences. This operator can be used as an extension to commonly employed search strategies. It is evaluated in experiments with artificial and real-world data.",0
"To recognize an object in an image, the user must apply a combination of operators, where each operator has a set of parameters. These parameters must be well adjusted in order to reach good results. Usually, this adjustment is made manually by the user. In this paper we propose a new method to automate the process of parameter adjustment for an object recognition task. Our method is based on reinforcement learning, we use two types of agents: User Agent that gives the necessary information and Parameter Agent that adjusts the parameters of each operator. Due to the nature of reinforcement learning the results do not depend only on the system characteristics but also on the user favorite choices.",0
"We present a method for dynamically generating Bayesian networks from knowledge bases consisting of first-order probability logic sentences. We present a subset of probability logic sufficient for representing the class of Bayesian networks with discrete-valued nodes. We impose constraints on the form of the sentences that guarantee that the knowledge base contains all the probabilistic information necessary to generate a network. We define the concept of d-separation for knowledge bases and prove that a knowledge base with independence conditions defined by d-separation is a complete specification of a probability distribution. We present a network generation algorithm that, given an inference problem in the form of a query Q and a set of evidence E, generates a network to compute P(Q|E). We prove the algorithm to be correct.",0
"Much recent research in decision theoretic planning has adopted Markov decision processes (MDPs) as the model of choice, and has attempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure. One particular algorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The algorithm as presented is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects. We describe a new decision theoretic regression operator that corrects this weakness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach.",0
"Tau-chain is a decentralized peer-to-peer network having three unified faces: Rules, Proofs, and Computer Programs, allowing a generalization of virtually any centralized or decentralized P2P network, together with many new abilities, as we present on this note.",0
"Approximate inference in dynamic systems is the problem of estimating the state of the system given a sequence of actions and partial observations. High precision estimation is fundamental in many applications like diagnosis, natural language processing, tracking, planning, and robotics. In this paper we present an algorithm that samples possible deterministic executions of a probabilistic sequence. The algorithm takes advantage of a compact representation (using first order logic) for actions and world states to improve the precision of its estimation. Theoretical and empirical results show that the algorithm's expected error is smaller than propositional sampling and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling techniques.",0
"Scoring rules for eliciting expert predictions of random variables are usually developed assuming that experts derive utility only from the quality of their predictions (e.g., score awarded by the rule, or payoff in a prediction market). We study a more realistic setting in which (a) the principal is a decision maker and will take a decision based on the expert's prediction; and (b) the expert has an inherent interest in the decision. For example, in a corporate decision market, the expert may derive different levels of utility from the actions taken by her manager. As a consequence the expert will usually have an incentive to misreport her forecast to influence the choice of the decision maker if typical scoring rules are used. We develop a general model for this setting and introduce the concept of a compensation rule. When combined with the expert's inherent utility for decisions, a compensation rule induces a net scoring rule that behaves like a normal scoring rule. Assuming full knowledge of expert utility, we provide a complete characterization of all (strictly) proper compensation rules. We then analyze the situation where the expert's utility function is not fully known to the decision maker. We show bounds on: (a) expert incentive to misreport; (b) the degree to which an expert will misreport; and (c) decision maker loss in utility due to such uncertainty. These bounds depend in natural ways on the degree of uncertainty, the local degree of convexity of net scoring function, and natural properties of the decision maker's utility function. They also suggest optimization procedures for the design of compensation rules. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of compensation rules as market scoring rules for self-interested experts in a prediction market.",0
"The belief bias effect is a phenomenon which occurs when we think that we judge an argument based on our reasoning, but are actually influenced by our beliefs and prior knowledge. Evans, Barston and Pollard carried out a psychological syllogistic reasoning task to prove this effect. Participants were asked whether they would accept or reject a given syllogism. We discuss one specific case which is commonly assumed to be believable but which is actually not logically valid. By introducing abnormalities, abduction and background knowledge, we adequately model this case under the weak completion semantics. Our formalization reveals new questions about possible extensions in abductive reasoning. For instance, observations and their explanations might include some relevant prior abductive contextual information concerning some side-effect or leading to a contestable or refutable side-effect. A weaker notion indicates the support of some relevant consequences by a prior abductive context. Yet another definition describes jointly supported relevant consequences, which captures the idea of two observations containing mutually supportive side-effects. Though motivated with and exemplified by the running psychology application, the various new general abductive context definitions are introduced here and given a declarative semantics for the first time, and have a much wider scope of application. Inspection points, a concept introduced by Pereira and Pinto, allows us to express these definitions syntactically and intertwine them into an operational semantics.",0
"LeoPARD supports the implementation of knowledge representation and reasoning tools for higher-order logic(s). It combines a sophisticated data structure layer (polymorphically typed {\lambda}-calculus with nameless spine notation, explicit substitutions, and perfect term sharing) with an ambitious multi-agent blackboard architecture (supporting prover parallelism at the term, clause, and search level). Further features of LeoPARD include a parser for all TPTP dialects, a command line interpreter, and generic means for the integration of external reasoners.",0
"The computational performance of the biological brain has long attracted significant interest and has led to inspirations in operating principles, algorithms, and architectures for computing and signal processing. In this work, we focus on hardware implementation of brain-like learning in a brain-inspired architecture. We demonstrate, in hardware, that 2-D crossbar arrays of phase change synaptic devices can achieve associative learning and perform pattern recognition. Device and array-level studies using an experimental 10x10 array of phase change synaptic devices have shown that pattern recognition is robust against synaptic resistance variations and large variations can be tolerated by increasing the number of training iterations. Our measurements show that increase in initial variation from 9 % to 60 % causes required training iterations to increase from 1 to 11.",0
"An important role carried out by cyber-security experts is the assessment of proposed computer systems, during their design stage. This task is fraught with difficulties and uncertainty, making the knowledge provided by human experts essential for successful assessment. Today, the increasing number of progressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that support the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research, we use weighted averages (WAs) and ordered weighted averages (OWAs) with evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts of the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security components can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these individual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of potential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks and weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights which factors and security components contribute most to a component's difficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in which experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a series of questions about the security components that are the subject of the attacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying important components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated. The resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems designers and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that can be achieved with the limited resources available.",0
"The high probability of hardware failures prevents many advanced robots (e.g. legged robots) to be confidently deployed in real-world situations (e.g post-disaster rescue). Instead of attempting to diagnose the failure(s), robots could adapt by trial-and-error in order to be able to complete their tasks. However, the best trial-and-error algorithms for robotics are all episodic: between each trial, the robot needs to be put back in the same state, that is, the robot is not learning autonomously. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning algorithm called ""Reset-free Trial-and-Error"" (RTE) that allows robots to recover from damage while completing their tasks. We evaluate it on a hexapod robot that is damaged in several ways (e.g. a missing leg, a shortened leg, etc.) and whose objective is to reach a sequence of targets in an arena. Our experiments show that the robot can recover most of its locomotion abilities in a few minutes, in an environment with obstacles, and without any human intervention. Overall, this new algorithm makes it possible to contemplate sending robots to places that are truly too dangerous for humans and in which robots cannot be rescued.",0
"Submodular function minimization is a fundamental optimization problem that arises in several applications in machine learning and computer vision. The problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time, but general purpose algorithms have high running times and are unsuitable for large-scale problems. Recent work have used convex optimization techniques to obtain very practical algorithms for minimizing functions that are sums of ``simple"" functions. In this paper, we use random coordinate descent methods to obtain algorithms with faster linear convergence rates and cheaper iteration costs. Compared to alternating projection methods, our algorithms do not rely on full-dimensional vector operations and they converge in significantly fewer iterations.",1
Structuring theories is one of the main approaches to reduce the combinatorial explosion associated with reasoning and exploring large theories. In the past we developed the notion of development graphs as a means to represent and maintain structured theories. In this paper we present a methodology and a resulting implementation to reveal the hidden structure of flat theories by transforming them into detailed development graphs. We review our approach using plain TSTP-representations of MIZAR articles obtaining more structured and also more concise theories.,0
"One of the big challenges in the development of probabilistic relational (or probabilistic logical) modeling and learning frameworks is the design of inference techniques that operate on the level of the abstract model representation language, rather than on the level of ground, propositional instances of the model. Numerous approaches for such ""lifted inference"" techniques have been proposed. While it has been demonstrated that these techniques will lead to significantly more efficient inference on some specific models, there are only very recent and still quite restricted results that show the feasibility of lifted inference on certain syntactically defined classes of models. Lower complexity bounds that imply some limitations for the feasibility of lifted inference on more expressive model classes were established early on in (Jaeger 2000). However, it is not immediate that these results also apply to the type of modeling languages that currently receive the most attention, i.e., weighted, quantifier-free formulas. In this paper we extend these earlier results, and show that under the assumption that NETIME =/= ETIME, there is no polynomial lifted inference algorithm for knowledge bases of weighted, quantifier- and function-free formulas. Further strengthening earlier results, this is also shown to hold for approximate inference, and for knowledge bases not containing the equality predicate.",0
"In this paper we propose a structural parameter of CNF formulas and use it to identify instances of weighted MaxSAT and #SAT that can be solved in polynomial time. Given a CNF formula we say that a set of clauses is precisely satisfiable if there is some complete assignment satisfying these clauses only. Let the ps-value of the formula be the number of precisely satisfiable sets of clauses. Applying the notion of branch decompositions to CNF formulas and using ps-value as cut function, we define the ps-width of a formula. For a formula given with a decomposition of polynomial ps-width we show dynamic programming algorithms solving weighted MaxSAT and #SAT in polynomial time. Combining with results of 'Belmonte and Vatshelle, Graph classes with structured neighborhoods and algorithmic applications, Theor. Comput. Sci. 511: 54-65 (2013)' we get polynomial-time algorithms solving weighted MaxSAT and #SAT for some classes of structured CNF formulas. For example, we get $O(m^2(m + n)s)$ algorithms for formulas $F$ of $m$ clauses and $n$ variables and size $s$, if $F$ has a linear ordering of the variables and clauses such that for any variable $x$ occurring in clause $C$, if $x$ appears before $C$ then any variable between them also occurs in $C$, and if $C$ appears before $x$ then $x$ occurs also in any clause between them. Note that the class of incidence graphs of such formulas do not have bounded clique-width.",0
"The importance of algorithm portfolio techniques for SAT has long been noted, and a number of very successful systems have been devised, including the most successful one --- SATzilla. However, all these systems are quite complex (to understand, reimplement, or modify). In this paper we propose a new algorithm portfolio for SAT that is extremely simple, but in the same time so efficient that it outperforms SATzilla. For a new SAT instance to be solved, our portfolio finds its k-nearest neighbors from the training set and invokes a solver that performs the best at those instances. The main distinguishing feature of our algorithm portfolio is the locality of the selection procedure --- the selection of a SAT solver is based only on few instances similar to the input one.",0
"We compare the effectiveness of four different syntactic CCG parsers for a semantic slot-filling task to explore how much syntactic supervision is required for downstream semantic analysis. This extrinsic, task-based evaluation also provides a unique window into the semantics captured (or missed) by unsupervised grammar induction systems.",1
"With the advance of efficient analytical methods for sensitivity analysis ofprobabilistic networks, the interest in the sensitivities revealed by real-life networks is rekindled. As the amount of data resulting from a sensitivity analysis of even a moderately-sized network is alreadyoverwhelming, methods for extracting relevant information are called for. One such methodis to study the derivative of the sensitivity functions yielded for a network's parameters. We further propose to build upon the concept of admissible deviation, that is, the extent to which a parameter can deviate from the true value without inducing a change in the most likely outcome. We illustrate these concepts by means of a sensitivity analysis of a real-life probabilistic network in oncology.",0
"Agent modelling involves considering how other agents will behave, in order to influence your own actions. In this paper, we explore the use of agent modelling in the hidden-information, collaborative card game Hanabi. We implement a number of rule-based agents, both from the literature and of our own devising, in addition to an Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (IS-MCTS) agent. We observe poor results from IS-MCTS, so construct a new, predictor version that uses a model of the agents with which it is paired. We observe a significant improvement in game-playing strength from this agent in comparison to IS-MCTS, resulting from its consideration of what the other agents in a game would do. In addition, we create a flawed rule-based agent to highlight the predictor's capabilities with such an agent.",0
"In this paper, we propose a framework to study a general class of strategic behavior in voting, which we call {\em vote operations}. Our main theorem is the following: if we fix the number alternatives, generate $n$ votes i.i.d. according to a distribution $\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity. Then, for any $\epsilon &gt;0$, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$, the minimum number of operations that are necessary for the strategic to achieve her goal falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\Theta(\sqrt n)$, (3) $\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote operations, any individual vote distribution $\pi$, and any generalized scoring rule, which includes (but not limited to) most commonly studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules (including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin, Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.",0
"A good dialogue agent should have the ability to interact with users. In this work, we explore this direction by designing a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie domain that allow the learner to interact with a teacher by both asking and answering questions. We investigate how a learner can benefit from asking questions in both an offline and online reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions. Our work represents a first step in developing end-to-end learned interactive dialogue agents.",1
"We report the ""Recurrent Deterioration"" (RD) phenomenon observed in online recommender systems. The RD phenomenon is reflected by the trend of performance degradation when the recommendation model is always trained based on users' feedbacks of the previous recommendations. There are several reasons for the recommender systems to encounter the RD phenomenon, including the lack of negative training data and the evolution of users' interests, etc. Motivated to tackle the problems causing the RD phenomenon, we propose the POMDP-Rec framework, which is a neural-optimized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process algorithm for recommender systems. We show that the POMDP-Rec framework effectively uses the accumulated historical data from real-world recommender systems and automatically achieves comparable results with those models fine-tuned exhaustively by domain exports on public datasets.",0
"In this paper we study the uses and the semantics of non-monotonic negation in probabilistic deductive data bases. Based on the stable semantics for classical logic programming, we introduce the notion of stable formula, functions. We show that stable formula, functions are minimal fixpoints of operators associated with probabilistic deductive databases with negation. Furthermore, since a. probabilistic deductive database may not necessarily have a stable formula function, we provide a stable class semantics for such databases. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed semantics can handle default reasoning naturally in the context of probabilistic deduction.",0
"Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is well-studied in artificial intelligence, robotics, theoretical computer science and operations research. We discuss issues that arise when generalizing MAPF methods to real-world scenarios and four research directions that address them. We emphasize the importance of addressing these issues as opposed to developing faster methods for the standard formulation of the MAPF problem.",0
"In many sequential decision-making problems we may want to manage risk by minimizing some measure of variability in costs in addition to minimizing a standard criterion. Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a relatively new risk measure that addresses some of the shortcomings of the well-known variance-related risk measures, and because of its computational efficiencies has gained popularity in finance and operations research. In this paper, we consider the mean-CVaR optimization problem in MDPs. We first derive a formula for computing the gradient of this risk-sensitive objective function. We then devise policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms that each uses a specific method to estimate this gradient and updates the policy parameters in the descent direction. We establish the convergence of our algorithms to locally risk-sensitive optimal policies. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms in an optimal stopping problem.",1
"In this paper, we present an approach that is able to handle with Z-numbers in the context of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. Z-numbers are composed of two parts, the first one is a restriction on the values that can be assumed, and the second part is the reliability of the information. As human beings we communicate with other people by means of natural language using sentences like: the journey time from home to university takes about half hour, very likely. Firstly, Z-numbers are converted to fuzzy numbers using a standard procedure. Next, the Z-TODIM and Z-TOPSIS are presented as a direct extension of the fuzzy TODIM and fuzzy TOPSIS, respectively. The proposed methods are applied to two case studies and compared with the standard approach using crisp values. Results obtained show the feasibility of the approach. In addition, a graphical interface was built to handle with both methods Z- TODIM and Z-TOPSIS allowing ease of use for user in other areas of knowledge.",0
"We provide two distributed confidence ball algorithms for solving linear bandit problems in peer to peer networks with limited communication capabilities. For the first, we assume that all the peers are solving the same linear bandit problem, and prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal asymptotic regret rate of any centralised algorithm that can instantly communicate information between the peers. For the second, we assume that there are clusters of peers solving the same bandit problem within each cluster, and we prove that our algorithm discovers these clusters, while achieving the optimal asymptotic regret rate within each one. Through experiments on several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the performance of proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art.",1
"Collaborative vocabulary development in the context of data integration is the process of finding consensus between the experts of the different systems and domains. The complexity of this process is increased with the number of involved people, the variety of the systems to be integrated and the dynamics of their domain. In this paper we advocate that the realization of a powerful version control system is the heart of the problem. Driven by this idea and the success of Git in the context of software development, we investigate the applicability of Git for collaborative vocabulary development. Even though vocabulary development and software development have much more similarities than differences there are still important differences. These need to be considered within the development of a successful versioning and collaboration system for vocabulary development. Therefore, this paper starts by presenting the challenges we were faced with during the creation of vocabularies collaboratively and discusses its distinction to software development. Based on these insights we propose Git4Voc which comprises guidelines how Git can be adopted to vocabulary development. Finally, we demonstrate how Git hooks can be implemented to go beyond the plain functionality of Git by realizing vocabulary-specific features like syntactic validation and semantic diffs.",0
"Case Based Reasoning and particularly Estimation by Analogy, has been used in a number of problem-solving areas, such as cost estimation. Conventional methods, despite the lack of a sound criterion for choosing nearest projects, were based on estimation using a fixed and predetermined number of neighbors from the entire set of historical instances. This approach puts boundaries to the estimation ability of such algorithms, for they do not take into consideration that every project under estimation is unique and requires different handling. The notion of distributions of distances together with a distance metric for distributions help us to adapt the proposed method (we call it DD-EbA) each time to a specific case that is to be estimated without loosing in prediction power or computational cost. The results of this paper show that the proposed technique achieves the above idea in a very efficient way.",0
"Graphical Markov models determined by acyclic digraphs (ADGs), also called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), are widely studied in statistics, computer science (as Bayesian networks), operations research (as influence diagrams), and many related fields. Because different ADGs may determine the same Markov equivalence class, it long has been of interest to determine the efficiency gained in model specification and search by working directly with Markov equivalence classes of ADGs rather than with ADGs themselves. A computer program was written to enumerate the equivalence classes of ADG models as specified by Pearl &amp; Verma's equivalence criterion. The program counted equivalence classes for models up to and including 10 vertices. The ratio of number of classes to ADGs appears to approach an asymptote of about 0.267. Classes were analyzed according to number of edges and class size. By edges, the distribution of number of classes approaches a Gaussian shape. By class size, classes of size 1 are most common, with the proportions for larger sizes initially decreasing but then following a more irregular pattern. The maximum number of classes generated by any undirected graph was found to increase approximately factorially. The program also includes a new variation of orderly algorithm for generating undirected graphs.",0
"Random Indexing (RI) K-tree is the combination of two algorithms for clustering. Many large scale problems exist in document clustering. RI K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity. It also exhibits features that are useful for managing a changing collection. Furthermore, it solves previous issues with sparse document vectors when using K-tree. The algorithms and data structures are defined, explained and motivated. Specific modifications to K-tree are made for use with RI. Experiments have been executed to measure quality. The results indicate that RI K-tree improves document cluster quality over the original K-tree algorithm.",0
"Algorithm portfolio approaches have achieved remarkable improvements over single solvers. However, the implementation of such systems is often highly specialized and specific to the problem domain. This makes it difficult for researchers to explore different techniques for their specific problems. We present LLAMA, a modular and extensible toolkit that facilitates the exploration of a range of different portfolio techniques on any problem domain. We describe the current capabilities and limitations of the toolkit and illustrate its usage on a set of example SAT problems.",0
"In this paper, we propose a set theoretic approach for knowledge representation. While the syntax of an application domain is captured by set theoretic constructs including individuals, concepts and operators, knowledge is formalized by equality assertions. We first present a primitive form that uses minimal assumed knowledge and constructs. Then, assuming naive set theory, we extend it by definitions, which are special kinds of knowledge. Interestingly, we show that the primitive form is expressive enough to define logic operators, not only propositional connectives but also quantifiers.",0
"In this paper we present an interface between a symbolic planner and a geometric task planner, which is different to a standard trajectory planner in that the former is able to perform geometric reasoning on abstract entities---tasks. We believe that this approach facilitates a more principled interface to symbolic planning, while also leaving more room for the geometric planner to make independent decisions. We show how the two planners could be interfaced, and how their planning and backtracking could be interleaved. We also provide insights for a methodology for using the combined system, and experimental results to use as a benchmark with future extensions to both the combined system, as well as to the geometric task planner.",0
"We propose that operator induction serves as an adequate model of perception. We explain how to reduce universal agent models to operator induction. We propose a universal measure of operator induction fitness, and show how it can be used in a reinforcement learning model and a homeostasis (self-preserving) agent based on the free energy principle. We show that the action of the homeostasis agent can be explained by the operator induction model.",0
"In order for robots to be integrated effectively into human work-flows, it is not enough to address the question of autonomy but also how their actions or plans are being perceived by their human counterparts. When robots generate task plans without such considerations, they may often demonstrate what we refer to as inexplicable behavior from the point of view of humans who may be observing it. This problem arises due to the human observer's partial or inaccurate understanding of the robot's deliberative process and/or the model (i.e. capabilities of the robot) that informs it. This may have serious implications on the human-robot work-space, from increased cognitive load and reduced trust in the robot from the human, to more serious concerns of safety in human-robot interactions. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by learning a distance function that can accurately model the notion of explicability, and develop an anytime search algorithm that can use this measure in its search process to come up with progressively explicable plans. As the first step, robot plans are evaluated by human subjects based on how explicable they perceive the plan to be, and a scoring function called explicability distance based on the different plan distance measures is learned. We then use this explicability distance as a heuristic to guide our search in order to generate explicable robot plans, by minimizing the plan distances between the robot's plan and the human's expected plans. We conduct our experiments in a toy autonomous car domain, and provide empirical evaluations that demonstrate the usefulness of the approach in making the planning process of an autonomous agent conform to human expectations.",0
"Logic is the science of correct inferences and a logical system is a tool to prove assertions in a certain logic in a correct way. There are many logical systems, and many ways of formalizing them, e.g., using natural deduction or sequent calculus. Calculus of structures (CoS) is a new formalism proposed by Alessio Guglielmi in 2004 that generalizes sequent calculus in the sense that inference rules can be applied at any depth inside a formula, rather than only to the main connective. With this feature, proofs in CoS are shorter than in any other formalism supporting analytical proofs. Although it is great to have the freedom and expressiveness of CoS, under the point of view of proof search more freedom means a larger search space. And that should be restricted when looking for complete automation of deductive systems. Some efforts were made to reduce this non-determinism, but they are all basically operational approaches, and no solid theoretical result regarding the computational behaviour of CoS has been achieved so far. The main focus of this thesis is to discuss ways to propose a proof search strategy for CoS suitable to implementation. This strategy should be theoretical instead of purely operational. We introduce the concept of incoherence number of substructures inside structures and we use this concept to achieve our main result: there is an algorithm that, according to our conjecture, corresponds to a proof search strategy to every provable structure in the subsystem of FBV (the multiplicative linear logic MLL plus the rule mix) containing only pairwise distinct atoms. Our algorithm is implemented and we believe our strategy is a good starting point to exploit the computational aspects of CoS in more general systems, like BV itself.",0
"Independent from the still ongoing research in measuring individual intelligence, we anticipate and provide a framework for measuring collective intelligence. Collective intelligence refers to the idea that several individuals can collaborate in order to achieve high levels of intelligence. We present thus some ideas on how the intelligence of a group can be measured and simulate such tests. We will however focus here on groups of artificial intelligence agents (i.e., machines). We will explore how a group of agents is able to choose the appropriate problem and to specialize for a variety of tasks. This is a feature which is an important contributor to the increase of intelligence in a group (apart from the addition of more agents and the improvement due to common decision making). Our results reveal some interesting results about how (collective) intelligence can be modeled, about how collective intelligence tests can be designed and about the underlying dynamics of collective intelligence. As it will be useful for our simulations, we provide also some improvements of the threshold allocation model originally used in the area of swarm intelligence but further generalized here.",0
"Well-designed medical decision support system (DSS) have been shown to improve health care quality. However, before they can be used in real clinical situations, these systems must be extensively tested, to ensure that they conform to the clinical guidelines (CG) on which they are based. Existing methods cannot be used for the systematic testing of all possible test cases. We describe here a new exhaustive dynamic verification method. In this method, the DSS is considered to be a black box, and the Quinlan C4.5 algorithm is used to build a decision tree from an exhaustive set of DSS input vectors and outputs. This method was successfully used for the testing of a medical DSS relating to chronic diseases: the ASTI critiquing module for type 2 diabetes.",0
"Answer set programming is a declarative programming paradigm oriented towards difficult combinatorial search problems. A fundamental task in answer set programming is to compute stable models, i.e., solutions of logic programs. Answer set solvers are the programs that perform this task. The problem of deciding whether a disjunctive program has a stable model is $\Sigma^P_2$-complete. The high complexity of reasoning within disjunctive logic programming is responsible for few solvers capable of dealing with such programs, namely DLV, GnT, Cmodels, CLASP and WASP. In this paper we show that transition systems introduced by Nieuwenhuis, Oliveras, and Tinelli to model and analyze satisfiability solvers can be adapted for disjunctive answer set solvers. Transition systems give a unifying perspective and bring clarity in the description and comparison of solvers. They can be effectively used for analyzing, comparing and proving correctness of search algorithms as well as inspiring new ideas in the design of disjunctive answer set solvers. In this light, we introduce a general template, which accounts for major techniques implemented in disjunctive solvers. We then illustrate how this general template captures solvers DLV, GnT and Cmodels. We also show how this framework provides a convenient tool for designing new solving algorithms by means of combinations of techniques employed in different solvers.",0
"This paper presents inference rules for Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). Our formalization is based on Notation 3 Logic, which extended RDF by logical symbols and created Semantic Web logic for deductive RDF graph stores. We also propose OWL-P that is a lightweight formalism of OWL and supports soft inferences by omitting complex language constructs.",0
"Local Process Models (LPM) describe structured fragments of process behavior occurring in the context of less structured business processes. Traditional LPM discovery aims to generate a collection of process models that describe highly frequent behavior, but these models do not always provide useful answers for questions posed by process analysts aiming at business process improvement. We propose a framework for goal-driven LPM discovery, based on utility functions and constraints. We describe four scopes on which these utility functions and constrains can be defined, and show that utility functions and constraints on different scopes can be combined to form composite utility functions/constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach by presenting several actionable business insights discovered with LPM discovery on two real life data sets.",0
"This article presents the top-level of an ontology categorizing and generalizing best practices and quality criteria or measures for Linked Data. It permits to compare these techniques and have a synthetic organized view of what can or should be done for knowledge sharing purposes. This ontology is part of a general knowledge base that can be accessed and complemented by any Web user. Thus, it can be seen as a cooperatively built library for the above cited elements. Since they permit to evaluate information objects and create better ones, these elements also permit knowledge-based tools and techniques - as well as knowledge providers - to be evaluated and categorized based on their input/output information objects. One top-level distinction permitting to organize this ontology is the one between content, medium and containers of descriptions. Various structural, ontological, syntactical and lexical distinctions are then used.",0
"There is a relatively small amount of research covering urban freight movements. Most research dealing with the subject of urban mobility focuses on passenger vehicles, not commercial vehicles hauling freight. However, in many ways, urban freight transport contributes to congestion, air pollution, noise, accident and more fuel consumption which raises logistic costs, and hence the price of products. The main focus of this paper is to propose a new solution for congestion in order to improve the distribution process of goods in urban areas and optimize transportation cost, time of delivery, fuel consumption, and environmental impact, while guaranteeing the safety of goods and passengers. A novel technique for personalization in itinerary search based on city logistics ontology and rules is proposed to overcome this problem. The integration of personalization plays a key role in capturing or inferring the needs of each stakeholder (user), and then satisfying these needs in a given context. The proposed approach is implemented to an itinerary search problem for freight transportation in urban areas to demonstrate its ability in facilitating intelligent decision support by retrieving the best itinerary that satisfies the most users preferences (stakeholders).",0
"This report presents a submission to the Process Discovery Contest. The contest is dedicated to the assessment of tools and techniques that discover business process models from event logs. The objective is to compare the efficiency of techniques to discover process models that provide a proper balance between ""overfitting"" and ""underfitting"". In the context of the Process Discovery Contest, process discovery is turned into a classification task with a training set and a test set; where a process model needs to decide whether traces are fitting or not. In this report, we first show how we use two discovery techniques, namely: Inductive Miner and Decomposition, to discover process models from the training set using ProM tool. Second, we show how we use replay results to 1) check the rediscoverability of models, and to 2) classify unseen traces (in test logs) as fitting or not. Then, we discuss the classification results of validation logs, the complexity of discovered models, and their impact on the selection of models for submission. The report ends with the pictures of the submitted process models.",0
"In this paper $\ast$--compatible extensions of fuzzy relations are studied, generalizing some results obtained by Duggan in case of crisp relations. From this general result are obtained as particular cases fuzzy versions of some important extension theorems for crisp relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura). Two notions of consistent closure of a fuzzy relation are introduced.",0
"In this work a mixed agent-based and discrete event simulation model is developed for a high frequency bus route in the Netherlands. With this model, different passenger growth scenarios can be easily evaluated. This simulation model helps policy makers to predict changes that have to be made to bus routes and planned travel times before problems occur. The model is validated using several performance indicators, showing that under some model assumptions, it can realistically simulate real-life situations. The simulation's workings are illustrated by two use cases.",0
"Collaborative data consist of ratings relating two distinct sets of objects: users and items. Much of the work with such data focuses on filtering: predicting unknown ratings for pairs of users and items. In this paper we focus on the problem of visualizing the information. Given all of the ratings, our task is to embed all of the users and items as points in the same Euclidean space. We would like to place users near items that they have rated (or would rate) high, and far away from those they would give a low rating. We pose this problem as a real-valued non-linear Bayesian network and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation maximization to find an embedding. We present a metric by which to judge the quality of a visualization and compare our results to local linear embedding and Eigentaste on three real-world datasets.",0
"We describe a technique that can be used for the fusion of multiple sources of information as well as for the evaluation and selection of alternatives under multi-criteria. Three important properties contribute to the uniqueness of the technique introduced. The first is the ability to do all necessary operations and aggregations with information that is of a nonnumeric linguistic nature. This facility greatly reduces the burden on the providers of information, the experts. A second characterizing feature is the ability assign, again linguistically, differing importance to the criteria or in the case of information fusion to the individual sources of information. A third significant feature of the approach is its ability to be used as method to find a consensus of the opinion of multiple experts on the issue of concern. The techniques used in this approach are base on ideas developed from the theory of approximate reasoning. We illustrate the approach with a problem of project selection.",0
"The increasing availability of affect-rich multimedia resources has bolstered interest in understanding sentiment and emotions in and from visual content. Adjective-noun pairs (ANP) are a popular mid-level semantic construct for capturing affect via visually detectable concepts such as ""cute dog"" or ""beautiful landscape"". Current state-of-the-art methods approach ANP prediction by considering each of these compound concepts as individual tokens, ignoring the underlying relationships in ANPs. This work aims at disentangling the contributions of the `adjectives' and `nouns' in the visual prediction of ANPs. Two specialised classifiers, one trained for detecting adjectives and another for nouns, are fused to predict 553 different ANPs. The resulting ANP prediction model is more interpretable as it allows us to study contributions of the adjective and noun components. Source code and models are available at",0
"NP-SPEC is a language for specifying problems in NP in a declarative way. Despite the fact that the semantics of the language was given by referring to Datalog with circumscription, which is very close to ASP, so far the only existing implementations are by means of ECLiPSe Prolog and via Boolean satisfiability solvers. In this paper, we present translations from NP-SPEC into various forms of ASP and analyze them. We also argue that it might be useful to incorporate certain language constructs of NP-SPEC into mainstream ASP.",0
"Max-product belief propagation (BP) is a popular message-passing algorithm for computing a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) assignment in a joint distribution represented by a graphical model (GM). It was recently shown that BP can solve certain classes of Linear Programming (LP) formulations to combinatorial optimization problems including maximum weight matching and shortest path, i.e., BP can be a distributed solver for certain LPs. However, those LPs and corresponding BP analysis are very sensitive to underlying problem setups, and it has been not clear what extent these results can be generalized to. In this paper, we obtain a generic criteria such that BP converges to the correct solution of the desired LP. Our theoretical result not only rediscovers prior known ones for maximum weight matching and shortest path as special cases, but also can be applied to new problems including traveling salesman, longest path and vertex cover, i.e., BP is a distributed (and parallel) solver to the combinatorial optimization problems. We believe that our results provide new insights on BP performances and new directions on distributed solvers for certain classes of large-scale LPs.",0
"We examine the complexity of inference in Bayesian networks specified by logical languages. We consider representations that range from fragments of propositional logic to function-free first-order logic with equality; in doing so we cover a variety of plate models and of probabilistic relational models. We study the complexity of inferences when network, query and domain are the input (the inferential and the combined complexity), when the network is fixed and query and domain are the input (the query/data complexity), and when the network and query are fixed and the domain is the input (the domain complexity). We draw connections with probabilistic databases and liftability results, and obtain complexity classes that range from polynomial to exponential levels.",0
"Graphical models based on conditional independence support concise encodings of the subjective belief of a single agent. A natural question is whether the consensus belief of a group of agents can be represented with equal parsimony. We prove, under relatively mild assumptions, that even if everyone agrees on a common graph topology, no method of combining beliefs can maintain that structure. Even weaker conditions rule out local aggregation within conditional probability tables. On a more positive note, we show that if probabilities are combined with the logarithmic opinion pool (LogOP), then commonly held Markov independencies are maintained. This suggests a straightforward procedure for constructing a consensus Markov network. We describe an algorithm for computing the LogOP with time complexity comparable to that of exact Bayesian inference.",0
"Reasoning semantically in first-order logic is notoriously a challenge. This paper surveys a selection of {\em semantically-guided} or {\em model-based} methods that aim at meeting aspects of this challenge. For first-order logic we touch upon {\em resolution-based} methods, {\em tableaux-based} methods, {\em DPLL-inspired} methods, and we give a preview of a new method called SGGS, for {\em Semantically-Guided Goal-Sensitive} reasoning. For first-order theories we highlight {\em hierarchical} and {\em locality-based} methods, concluding with the recent {\em Model-Constructing satisfiability calculus}.",0
"Non-sentential utterances (NSUs) are utterances that lack a complete sentential form but whose meaning can be inferred from the dialogue context, such as ""OK"", ""where?"", ""probably at his apartment"". The interpretation of non-sentential utterances is an important problem in computational linguistics since they constitute a frequent phenomena in dialogue and they are intrinsically context-dependent. The interpretation of NSUs is the task of retrieving their full semantic content from their form and the dialogue context. The first half of this thesis is devoted to the NSU classification task. Our work builds upon Fern\'andez et al. (2007) which present a series of machine-learning experiments on the classification of NSUs. We extended their approach with a combination of new features and semi-supervised learning techniques. The empirical results presented in this thesis show a modest but significant improvement over the state-of-the-art classification performance. The consecutive, yet independent, problem is how to infer an appropriate semantic representation of such NSUs on the basis of the dialogue context. Fern\'andez (2006) formalizes this task in terms of ""resolution rules"" built on top of the Type Theory with Records (TTR). Our work is focused on the reimplementation of the resolution rules from Fern\'andez (2006) with a probabilistic account of the dialogue state. The probabilistic rules formalism Lison (2014) is particularly suited for this task because, similarly to the framework developed by Ginzburg (2012) and Fern\'andez (2006), it involves the specification of update rules on the variables of the dialogue state to capture the dynamics of the conversation. However, the probabilistic rules can also encode probabilistic knowledge, thereby providing a principled account of ambiguities in the NSU resolution process.",0
"Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known, logics for managing structured knowledge. They allow reasoning about individuals and well defined concepts, i.e., set of individuals with common properties. The experience in using DLs in applications has shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities. In particular, their use in the context of Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) leads to the convincement that such DLs should allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content representation and retrieval. In this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of ALC, combining Zadeh's fuzzy logic with a classical DL. In particular, concepts becomes fuzzy and, thus, reasoning about imprecise concepts is supported. We will define its syntax, its semantics, describe its properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning in it.",0
"The paper describes multistage design of composite (modular) systems (i.e., design of a system trajectory). This design process consists of the following: (i) definition of a set of time/logical points; (ii) modular design of the system for each time/logical point (e.g., on the basis of combinatorial synthesis as hierarchical morphological design or multiple choice problem) to obtain several system solutions; (iii) selection of the system solution for each time/logical point while taking into account their quality and the quality of compatibility between neighbor selected system solutions (here, combinatorial synthesis is used as well). Mainly, the examined time/logical points are based on a time chain. In addition, two complicated cases are considered: (a) the examined logical points are based on a tree-like structure, (b) the examined logical points are based on a digraph. Numerical examples illustrate the approach.",0
"PK Dick once asked ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" In video games, a similar question could be asked of non-player characters: Do NPCs have dreams? Can they live and change as humans do? Can NPCs have personalities, and can these develop through interactions with players, other NPCs, and the world around them? Despite advances in personality AI for games, most NPCs are still undeveloped and undeveloping, reacting with flat affect and predictable routines that make them far less than human--in fact, they become little more than bits of the scenery that give out parcels of information. This need not be the case. Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine, creates adaptive NPC personalities. Originally developed as part of the thesis ""NPCs as People: Using Databases and Behaviour Trees to Give Non-Player Characters Personality,"" Extreme AI is now a fully functioning personality engine using all thirty facets of the Five Factor model of personality and an AI system that is live throughout gameplay. This paper discusses the research leading to Extreme AI; develops the ideas found in that thesis; discusses the development of other personality engines; and provides examples of Extreme AI's use in two game demos.",0
"The dynamics of belief and knowledge is one of the major components of any autonomous system that should be able to incorporate new pieces of information. In order to apply the rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented in this paper, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for knowledge bases (Horn or Horn logic with stratified negation). We show that knowledge base dynamics has an interesting connection with kernel change via hitting set and abduction. In this paper, we show how techniques from disjunctive logic programming can be used for efficient (deductive) database updates. The key idea is to transform the given database together with the update request into a disjunctive (datalog) logic program and apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model reasoning) to solve the original update problem. The approach extends and integrates standard techniques for efficient query answering and integrity checking. The generation of a hitting set is carried out through a hyper tableaux calculus and magic set that is focused on the goal of minimality. The present paper provides a comparative study of view update algorithms in rational approach. For, understand the basic concepts with abduction, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how belief base dynamics can provide an axiomatic characterization for insertion a view atom to the database. We give a quick overview of the main operators for belief change, in particular, belief update versus database update.",0
"In order for cooperative robots (""co-robots"") to respond to human behaviors accurately and efficiently in human-robot collaboration, interpretation of human actions, awareness of new situations, and appropriate decision making are all crucial abilities for co-robots. For this purpose, the human behaviors should be interpreted by co-robots in the same manner as human peers. To address this issue, a novel interpretability indicator is introduced so that robot actions are appropriate to the current human behaviors. In addition, the complete consideration of all potential situations of a robot's environment is nearly impossible in real-world applications, making it difficult for the co-robot to act appropriately and safely in new scenarios. This is true even when the pretrained model is highly accurate in a known situation. For effective and safe teaming with humans, we introduce a new generalizability indicator that allows a co-robot to self-reflect and reason about when an observation falls outside the co-robot's learned model. Based on topic modeling and two novel indicators, we propose a new Self-reflective Risk-aware Artificial Cognitive (SRAC) model. The co-robots are able to consider action risks and identify new situations so that better decisions can be made. Experiments both using real-world datasets and on physical robots suggest that our SRAC model significantly outperforms the traditional methodology and enables better decision making in response to human activities.",0
"We study the extension of relational multiagent systems (RMASs), where agents manipulate full-fledged relational databases, with data types and facets equipped with domain-specific, rigid relations (such as total orders). Specifically, we focus on design-time verification of RMASs against rich first-order temporal properties expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus with quantification across states. We build on previous decidability results under the ""state-bounded"" assumption, i.e., in each single state only a bounded number of data objects is stored in the agent databases, while unboundedly many can be encountered over time. We recast this condition, showing decidability in presence of dense, linear orders, and facets defined on top of them. Our approach is based on the construction of a finite-state, sound and complete abstraction of the original system, in which dense linear orders are reformulated as non-rigid relations working on the active domain of the system only. We also show undecidability when including a data type equipped with the successor relation.",0
"Security surveillance is one of the most important issues in smart cities, especially in an era of terrorism. Deploying a number of (video) cameras is a common surveillance approach. Given the never-ending power offered by vehicles to metropolises, exploiting vehicle traffic to design camera placement strategies could potentially facilitate security surveillance. This article constitutes the first effort toward building the linkage between vehicle traffic and security surveillance, which is a critical problem for smart cities. We expect our study could influence the decision making of surveillance camera placement, and foster more research of principled ways of security surveillance beneficial to our physical-world life.",0
"The syntactic topic model (STM) is a Bayesian nonparametric model of language that discovers latent distributions of words (topics) that are both semantically and syntactically coherent. The STM models dependency parsed corpora where sentences are grouped into documents. It assumes that each word is drawn from a latent topic chosen by combining document-level features and the local syntactic context. Each document has a distribution over latent topics, as in topic models, which provides the semantic consistency. Each element in the dependency parse tree also has a distribution over the topics of its children, as in latent-state syntax models, which provides the syntactic consistency. These distributions are convolved so that the topic of each word is likely under both its document and syntactic context. We derive a fast posterior inference algorithm based on variational methods. We report qualitative and quantitative studies on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. We show that the STM is a more predictive model of language than current models based only on syntax or only on topics.",1
"A low carbon society aims at fighting global warming by stimulating synergic efforts from governments, industry and scientific communities. Decision support systems should be adopted to provide policy makers with possible scenarios, options for prompt countermeasures in case of side effects on environment, economy and society due to low carbon society policies, and also options for information management. A necessary precondition to fulfill this agenda is to face the complexity of this multi-disciplinary domain and to reach a common understanding on it as a formal specification. Ontologies are widely accepted means to share knowledge. Together with semantic rules, they enable advanced semantic services to manage knowledge in a smarter way. Here we address the European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) and we present a knowledge base consisting of the EREON ontology and a catalogue of rules. Then we describe two innovative semantic services to manage ETS data and information on ETS scenarios.",0
"We introduce Game networks (G nets), a novel representation for multi-agent decision problems. Compared to other game-theoretic representations, such as strategic or extensive forms, G nets are more structured and more compact; more fundamentally, G nets constitute a computationally advantageous framework for strategic inference, as both probability and utility independencies are captured in the structure of the network and can be exploited in order to simplify the inference process. An important aspect of multi-agent reasoning is the identification of some or all of the strategic equilibria in a game; we present original convergence methods for strategic equilibrium which can take advantage of strategic separabilities in the G net structure in order to simplify the computations. Specifically, we describe a method which identifies a unique equilibrium as a function of the game payoffs, and one which identifies all equilibria.",0
"In this paper, we consider efficient learning in large-scale combinatorial semi-bandits with linear generalization, and as a solution, propose a novel learning algorithm called Randomized Combinatorial Maximization (RCM). RCM is motivated by Thompson sampling, and is computationally efficient as long as the offline version of the combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently. We establish that RCM is provably statistically efficient in the coherent Gaussian case, by developing a Bayes regret bound that is independent of the problem scale (number of items) and sublinear in time. We also evaluate RCM on a variety of real-world problems with thousands of items. Our experimental results demonstrate that RCM learns two orders of magnitude faster than the best baseline.",1
"This paper describes an approach to the methodology of answer set programming (ASP) that can facilitate the design of encodings that are easy to understand and provably correct. Under this approach, after appending a rule or a small group of rules to the emerging program we include a comment that states what has been ""achieved"" so far. This strategy allows us to set out our understanding of the design of the program by describing the roles of small parts of the program in a mathematically precise way.",0
"We present an algorithm, called Predict, for updating beliefs in causal networks quantified with order-of-magnitude probabilities. The algorithm takes advantage of both the structure and the quantification of the network and presents a polynomial asymptotic complexity. Predict exhibits a conservative behavior in that it is always sound but not always complete. We provide sufficient conditions for completeness and present algorithms for testing these conditions and for computing a complete set of plausible values. We propose Predict as an efficient method to estimate probabilistic values and illustrate its use in conjunction with two known algorithms for probabilistic inference. Finally, we describe an application of Predict to plan evaluation, present experimental results, and discuss issues regarding its use with conditional logics of belief, and in the characterization of irrelevance.",0
"Frequent itemset mining is a popular data mining technique. Apriori, Eclat, and FP-Growth are among the most common algorithms for frequent itemset mining. Considerable research has been performed to compare the relative performance between these three algorithms, by evaluating the scalability of each algorithm as the dataset size increases. While scalability as data size increases is important, previous papers have not examined the performance impact of similarly sized datasets that contain different itemset characteristics. This paper explores the effects that two dataset characteristics can have on the performance of these three frequent itemset algorithms. To perform this empirical analysis, a dataset generator is created to measure the effects of frequent item density and the maximum transaction size on performance. The generated datasets contain the same number of rows. This provides some insight into dataset characteristics that are conducive to each algorithm. The results of this paper's research demonstrate Eclat and FP-Growth both handle increases in maximum transaction size and frequent itemset density considerably better than the Apriori algorithm.",0
"The most successful parallel SAT and MaxSAT solvers follow a portfolio approach, where each thread applies a different algorithm (or the same algorithm configured differently) to solve a given problem instance. The main goal of building a portfolio is to diversify the search process being carried out by each thread. As soon as one thread finishes, the instance can be deemed solved. In this paper we present a new open source distributed solver for MaxSAT solving that addresses two issues commonly found in multicore parallel solvers, namely memory contention and scalability. Preliminary results show that our non-portfolio distributed MaxSAT solver outperforms its sequential version and is able to solve more instances as the number of processes increases.",0
"The idea of computer vision as the Bayesian inverse problem to computer graphics has a long history and an appealing elegance, but it has proved difficult to directly implement. Instead, most vision tasks are approached via complex bottom-up processing pipelines. Here we show that it is possible to write short, simple probabilistic graphics programs that define flexible generative models and to automatically invert them to interpret real-world images. Generative probabilistic graphics programs consist of a stochastic scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood model linking the renderer's output and the data, and latent variables that adjust the fidelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood model. Representations and algorithms from computer graphics, originally designed to produce high-quality images, are instead used as the deterministic backbone for highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian computation, and depends only on general-purpose, automatic inference techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and adversarially obscured alphanumeric characters, and inferring 3D road models from vehicle-mounted camera images. Each of the probabilistic graphics programs we present relies on under 20 lines of probabilistic code, and supports accurate, approximately Bayesian inferences about ambiguous real-world images.",1
"In this paper, we propose a single-agent modal logic framework for reasoning about goal-direct ""knowing how"" based on ideas from linguistics, philosophy, modal logic and automated planning. We first define a modal language to express ""I know how to guarantee phi given psi"" with a semantics not based on standard epistemic models but labelled transition systems that represent the agent's knowledge of his own abilities. A sound and complete proof system is given to capture the valid reasoning patterns about ""knowing how"" where the most important axiom suggests its compositional nature. Surprisingly, this simple language is powerful enough to express a version of ""knowing that"" and its interactions with ""knowing how"".",0
"Route choice in multimodal networks shows a considerable variation between different individuals as well as the current situational context. Personalization of recommendation algorithms are already common in many areas, e.g., online retail. However, most online routing applications still provide shortest distance or shortest travel-time routes only, neglecting individual preferences as well as the current situation. Both aspects are of particular importance in a multimodal setting as attractivity of some transportation modes such as biking crucially depends on personal characteristics and exogenous factors like the weather. This paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte Recommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route proposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user provides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options, sociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial profiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is designed in order to sharpen the profile. In this step a mass preference prior is used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified in step one. And third, subsequently the profile is continuously updated during usage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning techniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing individuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small number of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world dataset show that FAVOUR generates better-quality recommendations w.r.t. alternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular the definition of the mass preference prior for initialization of step two is shown to provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the literature.",0
"In this paper, a novel extreme learning machine based online multi-label classifier for real-time data streams is proposed. Multi-label classification is one of the actively researched machine learning paradigm that has gained much attention in the recent years due to its rapidly increasing real world applications. In contrast to traditional binary and multi-class classification, multi-label classification involves association of each of the input samples with a set of target labels simultaneously. There are no real-time online neural network based multi-label classifier available in the literature. In this paper, we exploit the inherent nature of high speed exhibited by the extreme learning machines to develop a novel online real-time classifier for multi-label data streams. The developed classifier is experimented with datasets from different application domains for consistency, performance and speed. The experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed and accuracy and can classify multi-label data streams in real-time.",0
"We show that there is a largely unexplored class of functions (positive polymatroids) that can define proper discrete metrics over pairs of binary vectors and that are fairly tractable to optimize over. By exploiting submodularity, we are able to give hardness results and approximation algorithms for optimizing over such metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of these metrics and associated algorithms on both a metric minimization task (a form of clustering) and also a metric maximization task (generating diverse k-best lists).",1
"We present a simple characterization of equivalent Bayesian network structures based on local transformations. The significance of the characterization is twofold. First, we are able to easily prove several new invariant properties of theoretical interest for equivalent structures. Second, we use the characterization to derive an efficient algorithm that identifies all of the compelled edges in a structure. Compelled edge identification is of particular importance for learning Bayesian network structures from data because these edges indicate causal relationships when certain assumptions hold.",0
"We investigate an approach to reasoning about causes through argumentation. We consider a causal model for a physical system, and look for arguments about facts. Some arguments are meant to provide explanations of facts whereas some challenge these explanations and so on. At the root of argumentation here, are causal links ({A_1, ... ,A_n} causes B) and ontological links (o_1 is_a o_2). We present a system that provides a candidate explanation ({A_1, ... ,A_n} explains {B_1, ... ,B_m}) by resorting to an underlying causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological links. Argumentation is then at work from these various explaining links. A case study is developed: a severe storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in 2010, with an unaccountably high number of casualties.",0
"The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is widely accepted as a robust derivative-free continuous optimization algorithm for non-linear and non-convex optimization problems. CMA-ES is well known to be almost parameterless, meaning that only one hyper-parameter, the population size, is proposed to be tuned by the user. In this paper, we propose a principled approach called self-CMA-ES to achieve the online adaptation of CMA-ES hyper-parameters in order to improve its overall performance. Experimental results show that for larger-than-default population size, the default settings of hyper-parameters of CMA-ES are far from being optimal, and that self-CMA-ES allows for dynamically approaching optimal settings.",0
"Despite the recent progress in automatic theorem provers, proof engineers are still suffering from the lack of powerful proof automation. In this position paper we first report our proof strategy language based on a meta-tool approach. Then, we propose an AI-based approach to drastically improve proof automation for Isabelle, while identifying three major challenges we plan to address for this objective.",0
"Location management refers to the problem of updating and searching the current location of mobile nodes in a wireless network. To make it efficient, the sum of update costs of location database must be minimized. Previous work relying on fixed location databases is unable to fully exploit the knowledge of user mobility patterns in the system so as to achieve this minimization. The study presents an intelligent location management approach which has interacts between intelligent information system and knowledge-base technologies, so we can dynamically change the user patterns and reduce the transition between the VLR and HLR. The study provides algorithms are ability to handle location registration and call delivery",0
"In this paper, we introduce a lightweight dynamic epistemic logical framework for automated planning under initial uncertainty. We reduce plan verification and conformant planning to model checking problems of our logic. We show that the model checking problem of the iteration-free fragment is PSPACE-complete. By using two non-standard (but equivalent) semantics, we give novel model checking algorithms to the full language and the iteration-free language.",0
"The ability to model search in a constraint solver can be an essential asset for solving combinatorial problems. However, existing infrastructure for defining search heuristics is often inadequate. Either modeling capabilities are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics. As a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored.",0
"One important challenge for a set of agents to achieve more efficient collaboration is for these agents to maintain proper models of each other. An important aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial and incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models: MDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many applications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt. While it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for learning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability models, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning capability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning, and the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan execution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of incompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP based and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\em abstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability models are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g., robot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore, when used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately), capability models provide flexible abstraction of actions. The limitation, however, is that the synthesized plan is incomplete and abstract.",0
"Inductive learning is based on inferring a general rule from a finite data set and using it to label new data. In transduction one attempts to solve the problem of using a labeled training set to label a set of unlabeled points, which are given to the learner prior to learning. Although transduction seems at the outset to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many provably useful algorithms for transduction. Moreover, the precise relation between induction and transduction has not yet been determined. The main theoretical developments related to transduction were presented by Vapnik more than twenty years ago. One of Vapnik's basic results is a rather tight error bound for transductive classification based on an exact computation of the hypergeometric tail. While tight, this bound is given implicitly via a computational routine. Our first contribution is a somewhat looser but explicit characterization of a slightly extended PAC-Bayesian version of Vapnik's transductive bound. This characterization is obtained using concentration inequalities for the tail of sums of random variables obtained by sampling without replacement. We then derive error bounds for compression schemes such as (transductive) support vector machines and for transduction algorithms based on clustering. The main observation used for deriving these new error bounds and algorithms is that the unlabeled test points, which in the transductive setting are known in advance, can be used in order to construct useful data dependent prior distributions over the hypothesis space.",0
"In this paper we study the complexity of strategic argumentation for dialogue games. A dialogue game is a 2-player game where the parties play arguments. We show how to model dialogue games in a skeptical, non-monotonic formalism, and we show that the problem of deciding what move (set of rules) to play at each turn is an NP-complete problem.",0
"Sum-product networks (SPNs) are a class of probabilistic graphical models that allow tractable marginal inference. However, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in SPNs is NP-hard. We investigate MAP inference in SPNs from both theoretical and algorithmic perspectives. For the theoretical part, we reduce general MAP inference to its special case without evidence and hidden variables; we also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the MAP problem to $2^{n^\epsilon}$ for fixed $0 \leq \epsilon &lt; 1$, where $n$ is the input size. For the algorithmic part, we first present an exact MAP solver that runs reasonably fast and could handle SPNs with up to 1k variables and 150k arcs in our experiments. We then present a new approximate MAP solver with a good balance between speed and accuracy, and our comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show that it has better overall performance than existing approximate solvers.",0
"This paper describes PinView, a content-based image retrieval system that exploits implicit relevance feedback collected during a search session. PinView contains several novel methods to infer the intent of the user. From relevance feedback, such as eye movements or pointer clicks, and visual features of images, PinView learns a similarity metric between images which depends on the current interests of the user. It then retrieves images with a specialized online learning algorithm that balances the tradeoff between exploring new images and exploiting the already inferred interests of the user. We have integrated PinView to the content-based image retrieval system PicSOM, which enables applying PinView to real-world image databases. With the new algorithms PinView outperforms the original PicSOM, and in online experiments with real users the combination of implicit and explicit feedback gives the best results.",0
"In the last two decades, modal and description logics have been applied to numerous areas of computer science, including knowledge representation, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, many approaches have been proposed for efficiently handling the satisfiability of the core normal modal logic K(m), and of its notational variant, the description logic ALC. Although simple in structure, K(m)/ALC is computationally very hard to reason on, its satisfiability being PSPACE-complete.",0
AThe paper gives a few arguments in favour of the use of chain graphs for description of probabilistic conditional independence structures. Every Bayesian network model can be equivalently introduced by means of a factorization formula with respect to a chain graph which is Markov equivalent to the Bayesian network. A graphical characterization of such graphs is given. The class of equivalent graphs can be represented by a distinguished graph which is called the largest chain graph. The factorization formula with respect to the largest chain graph is a basis of a proposal of how to represent the corresponding (discrete) probability distribution in a computer (i.e. parametrize it). This way does not depend on the choice of a particular Bayesian network from the class of equivalent networks and seems to be the most efficient way from the point of view of memory demands. A separation criterion for reading independency statements from a chain graph is formulated in a simpler way. It resembles the well-known d-separation criterion for Bayesian networks and can be implemented locally.,0
"How should we gather information to make effective decisions? We address Bayesian active learning and experimental design problems, where we sequentially select tests to reduce uncertainty about a set of hypotheses. Instead of minimizing uncertainty per se, we consider a set of overlapping decision regions of these hypotheses. Our goal is to drive uncertainty into a single decision region as quickly as possible.",0
"Many fields are now snowed under with an avalanche of data, which raises considerable challenges for computer scientists. Meanwhile, robotics (among other fields) can often only use a few dozen data points because acquiring them involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. How can an algorithm learn with only a few data points?",0
"The natural way to use Answer Set Programming (ASP) to represent knowledge in Artificial Intelligence or to solve a combinatorial problem is to elaborate a first order logic program with default negation. In a preliminary step this program with variables is translated in an equivalent propositional one by a first tool: the grounder. Then, the propositional program is given to a second tool: the solver. This last one computes (if they exist) one or many answer sets (stable models) of the program, each answer set encoding one solution of the initial problem. Until today, almost all ASP systems apply this two steps computation. In this article, the project ASPeRiX is presented as a first order forward chaining approach for Answer Set Computing. This project was amongst the first to introduce an approach of answer set computing that escapes the preliminary phase of rule instantiation by integrating it in the search process. The methodology applies a forward chaining of first order rules that are grounded on the fly by means of previously produced atoms. Theoretical foundations of the approach are presented, the main algorithms of the ASP solver ASPeRiX are detailed and some experiments and comparisons with existing systems are provided.",0
"We consider the problem of controlling a Markov decision process (MDP) with a large state space, so as to minimize average cost. Since it is intractable to compete with the optimal policy for large scale problems, we pursue the more modest goal of competing with a low-dimensional family of policies. We use the dual linear programming formulation of the MDP average cost problem, in which the variable is a stationary distribution over state-action pairs, and we consider a neighborhood of a low-dimensional subset of the set of stationary distributions (defined in terms of state-action features) as the comparison class. We propose two techniques, one based on stochastic convex optimization, and one based on constraint sampling. In both cases, we give bounds that show that the performance of our algorithms approaches the best achievable by any policy in the comparison class. Most importantly, these results depend on the size of the comparison class, but not on the size of the state space. Preliminary experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in a queuing application.",1
"Recent attempts to automate business processes and medical-treatment processes have uncovered the need for a formal framework that can accommodate not only temporal constraints, but also observations and actions with uncontrollable durations. To meet this need, this paper defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that combines the simple temporal constraints from a Simple Temporal Network (STN) with the conditional nodes from a Conditional Simple Temporal Problem (CSTP) and the contingent links from a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU). A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU. The paper also presents some sound constraint-propagation rules for dynamic controllability that are expected to form the backbone of a dynamic-controllability-checking algorithm for CSTNUs.",0
"A number of attempts have been made to improve accuracy and/or scalability of the PC (Peter and Clark) algorithm, some well known (Buhlmann, et al., 2010; Kalisch and Buhlmann, 2007; 2008; Zhang, 2012, to give some examples). We add here one more tool to the toolbox: the simple observation that if one is forced to choose between a variety of possible conditioning sets for a pair of variables, one should choose the one with the highest p-value. One can use the CPC (Conservative PC, Ramsey et al., 2012) algorithm as a guide to possible sepsets for a pair of variables. However, whereas CPC uses a voting rule to classify colliders versus noncolliders, our proposed algorithm, PC-Max, picks the conditioning set with the highest p-value, so that there are no ambiguities. We combine this with two other optimizations: (a) avoiding bidirected edges in the orientation of colliders, and (b) parallelization. For (b) we borrow ideas from the PC-Stable algorithm (Colombo and Maathuis, 2014). The result is an algorithm that scales quite well both in terms of accuracy and time, with no risk of bidirected edges.",0
"We introduce an abductive method for a coherent integration of independent data-sources. The idea is to compute a list of data-facts that should be inserted to the amalgamated database or retracted from it in order to restore its consistency. This method is implemented by an abductive solver, called Asystem, that applies SLDNFA-resolution on a meta-theory that relates different, possibly contradicting, input databases. We also give a pure model-theoretic analysis of the possible ways to `recover' consistent data from an inconsistent database in terms of those models of the database that exhibit as minimal inconsistent information as reasonably possible. This allows us to characterize the `recovered databases' in terms of the `preferred' (i.e., most consistent) models of the theory. The outcome is an abductive-based application that is sound and complete with respect to a corresponding model-based, preferential semantics, and -- to the best of our knowledge -- is more expressive (thus more general) than any other implementation of coherent integration of databases.",0
"We present a generalization of the local expression language used in the Symbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) approach to inference in belief nets [1l, [8]. The local expression language in SPI is the language in which the dependence of a node on its antecedents is described. The original language represented the dependence as a single monolithic conditional probability distribution. The extended language provides a set of operators (*, +, and -) which can be used to specify methods for combining partial conditional distributions. As one instance of the utility of this extension, we show how this extended language can be used to capture the semantics, representational advantages, and inferential complexity advantages of the ""noisy or"" relationship.",0
"Randomized experiments have been used to assist decision-making in many areas. They help people select the optimal treatment for the test population with certain statistical guarantee. However, subjects can show significant heterogeneity in response to treatments. The problem of customizing treatment assignment based on subject characteristics is known as uplift modeling, differential response analysis, or personalized treatment learning in literature. A key feature for uplift modeling is that the data is unlabeled. It is impossible to know whether the chosen treatment is optimal for an individual subject because response under alternative treatments is unobserved. This presents a challenge to both the training and the evaluation of uplift models. In this paper we describe how to obtain an unbiased estimate of the key performance metric of an uplift model, the expected response. We present a new uplift algorithm which creates a forest of randomized trees. The trees are built with a splitting criterion designed to directly optimize their uplift performance based on the proposed evaluation method. Both the evaluation method and the algorithm apply to arbitrary number of treatments and general response types. Experimental results on synthetic data and industry-provided data show that our algorithm leads to significant performance improvement over other applicable methods.",0
"We explore a method for computing admissible heuristic evaluation functions for search problems. It utilizes pattern databases, which are precomputed tables of the exact cost of solving various subproblems of an existing problem. Unlike standard pattern database heuristics, however, we partition our problems into disjoint subproblems, so that the costs of solving the different subproblems can be added together without overestimating the cost of solving the original problem. Previously, we showed how to statically partition the sliding-tile puzzles into disjoint groups of tiles to compute an admissible heuristic, using the same partition for each state and problem instance. Here we extend the method and show that it applies to other domains as well. We also present another method for additive heuristics which we call dynamically partitioned pattern databases. Here we partition the problem into disjoint subproblems for each state of the search dynamically. We discuss the pros and cons of each of these methods and apply both methods to three different problem domains: the sliding-tile puzzles, the 4-peg Towers of Hanoi problem, and finding an optimal vertex cover of a graph. We find that in some problem domains, static partitioning is most effective, while in others dynamic partitioning is a better choice. In each of these problem domains, either statically partitioned or dynamically partitioned pattern database heuristics are the best known heuristics for the problem.",0
"A core problem in learning semantic parsers from denotations is picking out consistent logical forms--those that yield the correct denotation--from a combinatorially large space. To control the search space, previous work relied on restricted set of rules, which limits expressivity. In this paper, we consider a much more expressive class of logical forms, and show how to use dynamic programming to efficiently represent the complete set of consistent logical forms. Expressivity also introduces many more spurious logical forms which are consistent with the correct denotation but do not represent the meaning of the utterance. To address this, we generate fictitious worlds and use crowdsourced denotations on these worlds to filter out spurious logical forms. On the WikiTableQuestions dataset, we increase the coverage of answerable questions from 53.5% to 76%, and the additional crowdsourced supervision lets us rule out 92.1% of spurious logical forms.",1
"Dual decomposition, and more generally Lagrangian relaxation, is a classical method for combinatorial optimization; it has recently been applied to several inference problems in natural language processing (NLP). This tutorial gives an overview of the technique. We describe example algorithms, describe formal guarantees for the method, and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms. While our examples are predominantly drawn from the NLP literature, the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning. A central theme of this tutorial is that Lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms, allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on Lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models.",0
"Many applications of intelligent systems require reasoning about the mental states of agents in the domain. We may want to reason about an agent's beliefs, including beliefs about other agents; we may also want to reason about an agent's preferences, and how his beliefs and preferences relate to his behavior. We define a probabilistic epistemic logic (PEL) in which belief statements are given a formal semantics, and provide an algorithm for asserting and querying PEL formulas in Bayesian networks. We then show how to reason about an agent's behavior by modeling his decision process as an influence diagram and assuming that he behaves rationally. PEL can then be used for reasoning from an agent's observed actions to conclusions about other aspects of the domain, including unobserved domain variables and the agent's mental states.",0
"One of the most important fields in robotics is the optimization of controllers. Currently, robots are treated as a black box in this optimization process, which is the reason why derivative-free optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms or reinforcement learning are omnipresent. We propose an implementation of a modern physics engine, which has the ability to differentiate control parameters. This has been implemented on both CPU and GPU. We show how this speeds up the optimization process, even for small problems, and why it will scale to bigger problems. We explain why this is an alternative approach to deep Q-learning, for using deep learning in robotics. Lastly, we argue that this is a big step for deep learning in robotics, as it opens up new possibilities to optimize robots, both in hardware and software.",0
"Many real world problems can be defined as optimisation problems in which the aim is to maximise an objective function. The quality of obtained solution is directly linked to the pertinence of the used objective function. However, designing such function, which has to translate the user needs, is usually fastidious. In this paper, a method to help user objective functions designing is proposed. Our approach, which is highly interactive, is based on man machine dialogue and more particularly on the comparison of problem instance solutions by the user. We propose an experiment in the domain of cartographic generalisation that shows promising results.",0
"Market-based mechanisms such as auctions are being studied as an appropriate means for resource allocation in distributed and mulitagent decision problems. When agents value resources in combination rather than in isolation, they must often deliberate about appropriate bidding strategies for a sequence of auctions offering resources of interest. We briefly describe a discrete dynamic programming model for constructing appropriate bidding policies for resources exhibiting both complementarities and substitutability. We then introduce a continuous approximation of this model, assuming that money (or the numeraire good) is infinitely divisible. Though this has the potential to reduce the computational cost of computing policies, value functions in the transformed problem do not have a convenient closed form representation. We develop {em grid-based} approximation for such value functions, representing value functions using piecewise linear approximations. We show that these methods can offer significant computational savings with relatively small cost in solution quality.",0
"In this paper we propose an extension of Defeasible Logic to represent and compute three concepts of defeasible permission. In particular, we discuss different types of explicit permissive norms that work as exceptions to opposite obligations. Moreover, we show how strong permissions can be represented both with, and without introducing a new consequence relation for inferring conclusions from explicit permissive norms. Finally, we illustrate how a preference operator applicable to contrary-to-duty obligations can be combined with a new operator representing ordered sequences of strong permissions which derogate from prohibitions. The logical system is studied from a computational standpoint and is shown to have liner computational complexity.",0
This manual outlines a fully automated liquid handling robot to enable physically-embodied evolution within a chemical oil-droplet system. The robot is based upon the REPRAP3D printer system and makes the droplets by mixing chemicals and then placing them in a petri dish after which they are recorded using a camera and the behaviour of the droplets analysed using image recognition software.

"We administered the Verbal IQ (VIQ) part of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) to the ConceptNet 4 AI system. The test questions (e.g., ""Why do we shake hands?"") were translated into ConceptNet 4 inputs using a combination of the simple natural language processing tools that come with ConceptNet together with short Python programs that we wrote. The question answering used a version of ConceptNet based on spectral methods. The ConceptNet system scored a WPPSI-III VIQ that is average for a four-year-old child, but below average for 5 to 7 year-olds. Large variations among subtests indicate potential areas of improvement. In particular, results were strongest for the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests, intermediate for the Information subtest, and lowest for the Comprehension and Word Reasoning subtests. Comprehension is the subtest most strongly associated with common sense. The large variations among subtests and ordinary common sense strongly suggest that the WPPSI-III VIQ results do not show that ""ConceptNet has the verbal abilities a four-year-old."" Rather, children's IQ tests offer one objective metric for the evaluation and comparison of AI systems. Also, this work continues previous research on Psychometric AI.",0
"The problem of sparse rewards is one of the hardest challenges in contemporary reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) tackles this problem by using a set of temporally-extended actions, or options, each of which has its own subgoal. These subgoals are normally handcrafted for specific tasks. Here, though, we introduce a generic class of subgoals with broad applicability in the visual domain. Underlying our approach (in common with work using ""auxiliary tasks"") is the hypothesis that the ability to control aspects of the environment is an inherently useful skill to have. We incorporate such subgoals in an end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning system and test two variants of our algorithm on a number of games from the Atari suite. We highlight the advantage of our approach in one of the hardest games -- Montezuma's revenge -- for which the ability to handle sparse rewards is key. Our agent learns several times faster than the current state-of-the-art HRL agent in this game, reaching a similar level of performance.",0
"We propose a way of extracting and aggregating per-move evaluations from sets of Go game records. The evaluations capture different aspects of the games such as played patterns or statistic of sente/gote sequences. Using machine learning algorithms, the evaluations can be utilized to predict different relevant target variables. We apply this methodology to predict the strength and playing style of the player (e.g. territoriality or aggressivity) with good accuracy. We propose a number of possible applications including aiding in Go study, seeding real-work ranks of internet players or tuning of Go-playing programs.",0
"Probability measures by themselves, are known to be inappropriate for modeling the dynamics of plain belief and their excessively strong measurability constraints make them unsuitable for some representational tasks, e.g. in the context of firstorder knowledge. In this paper, we are therefore going to look for possible alternatives and extensions. We begin by delimiting the general area of interest, proposing a minimal list of assumptions to be satisfied by any reasonable quasi-probabilistic valuation concept. Within this framework, we investigate two particularly interesting kinds of quasi-measures which are not or much less affected by the traditional problems. * Ranking measures, which generalize Spohn-type and possibility measures. * Cumulative measures, which combine the probabilistic and the ranking philosophy, allowing thereby a fine-grained account of static and dynamic belief.",0
"Applying deep reinforcement learning (RL) on real systems suffers from slow data sampling. We propose an enhanced generative adversarial network (EGAN) to initialize an RL agent in order to achieve faster learning. The EGAN utilizes the relation between states and actions to enhance the quality of data samples generated by a GAN. Pre-training the agent with the EGAN shows a steeper learning curve with a 20% improvement of training time in the beginning of learning, compared to no pre-training, and an improvement compared to training with GAN by about 5% with smaller variations. For real time systems with sparse and slow data sampling the EGAN could be used to speed up the early phases of the training process.",0
"Recent work introduced the cube-and-conquer technique to solve hard SAT instances. It partitions the search space into cubes using a lookahead solver. Each cube is tackled by a conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solver. Crucial for strong performance is the cutoff heuristic that decides when to switch from lookahead to CDCL. Yet, this offline heuristic is far from ideal. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid solver that applies the cube and conquer steps simultaneously. A lookahead and a CDCL solver work together on each cube, while communication is restricted to synchronization. Our concurrent cube-and-conquer solver can solve many instances faster than pure lookahead, pure CDCL and offline cube-and-conquer, and can abort early in favor of a pure CDCL search if an instance is not suitable for cube-and-conquer techniques.",0
"Measuring the effectiveness of corporate environmental reports, it being highly qualitative and less regulated, is often considered as a daunting task. The task becomes more complex if comparisons are to be performed. This study is undertaken to overcome the physical verification problems by implementing data mining technique. It further explores on the effectiveness by performing exploratory analysis and structural equation model to bring out the significant linkages between the selected 10 variables. Samples of five hundred and thirty nine reports across various countries are used from an international directory to perform the statistical analysis like: One way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), MDA (Multivariate Discriminant Analysis) and SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). The results indicate the significant differences among the various types of industries in their environmental reporting, and the exploratory factors like stakeholder, organization strategy and industrial oriented factors, proved significant. The major accomplishment is that the findings correlate with the conceptual frame work of GRI.",0
"A typical IR system that delivers and stores information is affected by problem of matching between user query and available content on web. Use of Ontology represents the extracted terms in form of network graph consisting of nodes, edges, index terms etc. The above mentioned IR approaches provide relevance thus satisfying users query. The paper also emphasis on analyzing multimedia documents and performs calculation for extracted terms using different statistical formulas. The proposed model developed reduces semantic gap and satisfies user needs efficiently.",0
"We describe and evaluate the algorithmic techniques that are used in the FF planning system. Like the HSP system, FF relies on forward state space search, using a heuristic that estimates goal distances by ignoring delete lists. Unlike HSP's heuristic, our method does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and used to prune the search space. FF was the most successful automatic planner at the recent AIPS-2000 planning competition. We review the results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of FF compared to HSP.",0
"Decision circuits have been developed to perform efficient evaluation of influence diagrams [Bhattacharjya and Shachter, 2007], building on the advances in arithmetic circuits for belief network inference [Darwiche,2003]. In the process of model building and analysis, we perform sensitivity analysis to understand how the optimal solution changes in response to changes in the model. When sequential decision problems under uncertainty are represented as decision circuits, we can exploit the efficient solution process embodied in the decision circuit and the wealth of derivative information available to compute the value of information for the uncertainties in the problem and the effects of changes to model parameters on the value and the optimal strategy.",0
"Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is highly intractable in general, at least in part because the optimal policy may be infinitely large. In this paper, we explore the problem of finding the optimal policy from a restricted set of policies, represented as finite state automata of a given size. This problem is also intractable, but we show that the complexity can be greatly reduced when the POMDP and/or policy are further constrained. We demonstrate good empirical results with a branch-and-bound method for finding globally optimal deterministic policies, and a gradient-ascent method for finding locally optimal stochastic policies.",0
"The existence of a coalition strategy to achieve a goal does not necessarily mean that the coalition has enough information to know how to follow the strategy. Neither does it mean that the coalition knows that such a strategy exists. The article studies an interplay between the distributed knowledge, coalition strategies, and coalition ""know-how"" strategies. The main technical result is a sound and complete trimodal logical system that describes the properties of this interplay.",0
"Systems for symbolic event recognition accept as input a stream of time-stamped events from sensors and other computational devices, and seek to identify high-level composite events, collections of events that satisfy some pattern. RTEC is an Event Calculus dialect with novel implementation and 'windowing' techniques that allow for efficient event recognition, scalable to large data streams. RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a (variable) delay from, and are revised by, the underlying sources. RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision. Our evaluation shows that RTEC can support real-time event recognition and is capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in a recent survey of event processing use cases.",0
Virtual e-Science infrastructures supporting Web-based scientific workflows are an example for knowledge-intensive collaborative and weakly-structured processes where the interaction with the human scientists during process execution plays a central role. In this paper we propose the lightweight dynamic user-friendly interaction with humans during execution of scientific workflows via the low-barrier approach of Semantic Wikis as an intuitive interface for non-technical scientists. Our Process Makna Semantic Wiki system is a novel combination of an business process management system adapted for scientific workflows with a Corporate Semantic Web Wiki user interface supporting knowledge intensive human interaction tasks during scientific workflow execution.,0
"Our study revisits the problem of accuracy-fairness tradeoff in binary classification. We argue that comparison of non-discriminatory classifiers needs to account for different rates of positive predictions, otherwise conclusions about performance may be misleading, because accuracy and discrimination of naive baselines on the same dataset vary with different rates of positive predictions. We provide methodological recommendations for sound comparison of non-discriminatory classifiers, and present a brief theoretical and empirical analysis of tradeoffs between accuracy and non-discrimination.",0
"Value iteration is a popular algorithm for finding near optimal policies for POMDPs. It is inefficient due to the need to account for the entire belief space, which necessitates the solution of large numbers of linear programs. In this paper, we study value iteration restricted to belief subsets. We show that, together with properly chosen belief subsets, restricted value iteration yields near-optimal policies and we give a condition for determining whether a given belief subset would bring about savings in space and time. We also apply restricted value iteration to two interesting classes of POMDPs, namely informative POMDPs and near-discernible POMDPs.",0
"A reason maintenance system which extends an ATMS through Mukaidono's fuzzy logic is described.

"The challenging task of learning structures of probabilistic graphical models is an important problem within modern AI research. Recent years have witnessed several major algorithmic advances in structure learning for Bayesian networks---arguably the most central class of graphical models---especially in what is known as the score-based setting. A successful generic approach to optimal Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), based on integer programming (IP), is implemented in the GOBNILP system. Despite the recent algorithmic advances, current understanding of foundational aspects underlying the IP based approach to BNSL is still somewhat lacking. Understanding fundamental aspects of cutting planes and the related separation problem( is important not only from a purely theoretical perspective, but also since it holds out the promise of further improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art approaches to solving BNSL exactly. In this paper, we make several theoretical contributions towards these goals: (i) we study the computational complexity of the separation problem, proving that the problem is NP-hard; (ii) we formalise and analyse the relationship between three key polytopes underlying the IP-based approach to BNSL; (iii) we study the facets of the three polytopes both from the theoretical and practical perspective, providing, via exhaustive computation, a complete enumeration of facets for low-dimensional family-variable polytopes; and, furthermore, (iv) we establish a tight connection of the BNSL problem to the acyclic subgraph problem.",0
"Task-oriented dialogue focuses on conversational agents that participate in user-initiated dialogues on domain-specific topics. In contrast to chatbots, which simply seek to sustain open-ended meaningful discourse, existing task-oriented agents usually explicitly model user intent and belief states. This paper examines bypassing such an explicit representation by depending on a latent neural embedding of state and learning selective attention to dialogue history together with copying to incorporate relevant prior context. We complement recent work by showing the effectiveness of simple sequence-to-sequence neural architectures with a copy mechanism. Our model outperforms more complex memory-augmented models by 7% in per-response generation and is on par with the current state-of-the-art on DSTC2.",0
"We frame the question of what kind of subjective experience a brain simulation would have in contrast to a biological brain. We discuss the brain prosthesis thought experiment. We evaluate how the experience of the brain simulation might differ from the biological, according to a number of hypotheses about experience and the properties of simulation. Then, we identify finer questions relating to the original inquiry, and answer them from both a general physicalist, and panexperientialist perspective.",0
"In this paper we propose a new approach to probabilistic inference on belief networks, global conditioning, which is a simple generalization of Pearl's (1986b) method of loopcutset conditioning. We show that global conditioning, as well as loop-cutset conditioning, can be thought of as a special case of the method of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter (1988) as refined by Jensen et al (199Oa; 1990b). Nonetheless, this approach provides new opportunities for parallel processing and, in the case of sequential processing, a tradeoff of time for memory. We also show how a hybrid method (Suermondt and others 1990) combining loop-cutset conditioning with Jensen's method can be viewed within our framework. By exploring the relationships between these methods, we develop a unifying framework in which the advantages of each approach can be combined successfully.",0
"The goal of model-based diagnosis is to isolate causes of anomalous system behavior and recommend inexpensive repair actions in response. In general, precomputing optimal repair policies is intractable. To date, investigators addressing this problem have explored approximations that either impose restrictions on the system model (such as a single fault assumption) or compute an immediate best action with limited lookahead. In this paper, we develop a formulation of repair in model-based diagnosis and a repair algorithm that computes optimal sequences of actions. This optimal approach is costly but can be applied to precompute an optimal repair strategy for compact systems. We show how we can exploit a hierarchical system specification to make this approach tractable for large systems. When introducing hierarchy, we also consider the tradeoff between simply replacing a component and decomposing it to repair its subcomponents. The hierarchical repair algorithm is suitable for off-line precomputation of an optimal repair strategy. A modification of the algorithm takes advantage of an iterative deepening scheme to trade off inference time and the quality of the computed strategy.",0
"Most practitioners use a variant of the Alpha-Beta algorithm, a simple depth-first pro- cedure, for searching minimax trees. SSS*, with its best-first search strategy, reportedly offers the potential for more efficient search. However, the complex formulation of the al- gorithm and its alleged excessive memory requirements preclude its use in practice. For two decades, the search efficiency of ""smart"" best-first SSS* has cast doubt on the effectiveness of ""dumb"" depth-first Alpha-Beta. This paper presents a simple framework for calling Alpha-Beta that allows us to create a variety of algorithms, including SSS* and DUAL*. In effect, we formulate a best-first algorithm using depth-first search. Expressed in this framework SSS* is just a special case of Alpha-Beta, solving all of the perceived drawbacks of the algorithm. In practice, Alpha-Beta variants typically evaluate less nodes than SSS*. A new instance of this framework, MTD(f), out-performs SSS* and NegaScout, the Alpha-Beta variant of choice by practitioners.",0
We study properties of particular non-redundant sets of if-then rules describing dependencies between graded attributes. We introduce notions of saturation and witnessed non-redundancy of sets of graded attribute implications are show that bases of graded attribute implications given by systems of pseudo-intents correspond to non-redundant sets of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents where the non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of the contained graded attribute implications. We introduce an algorithm which transforms any complete set of graded attribute implications parameterized by globalization into a base given by pseudo-intents. Experimental evaluation is provided to compare the method of obtaining bases for general parameterizations by hedges with earlier graph-based approaches.,0
"In this paper, we propose an extension of our Mining for SAT framework to Constraint satisfaction Problem (CSP). We consider n-ary extensional constraints (table constraints). Our approach aims to reduce the size of the CSP by exploiting the structure of the constraints graph and of its associated microstructure. More precisely, we apply itemset mining techniques to search for closed frequent itemsets on these two representation. Using Tseitin extension, we rewrite the whole CSP to another compressed CSP equivalent with respect to satisfiability. Our approach contrast with previous proposed approach by Katsirelos and Walsh, as we do not change the structure of the constraints.",0
"We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with a set of target states and every transition is associated with an integer cost. The optimization objective we study asks to minimize the expected total cost till the target set is reached, while ensuring that the target set is reached almost-surely (with probability 1). We show that for integer costs approximating the optimal cost is undecidable. For positive costs, our results are as follows: (i) we establish matching lower and upper bounds for the optimal cost and the bound is double exponential; (ii) we show that the problem of approximating the optimal cost is decidable and present approximation algorithms developing on the existing algorithms for POMDPs with finite-horizon objectives. While the worst-case running time of our algorithm is double exponential, we also present efficient stopping criteria for the algorithm and show experimentally that it performs well in many examples of interest.",1
"We introduce a novel logical notion--partial entailment--to propositional logic. In contrast with classical entailment, that a formula P partially entails another formula Q with respect to a background formula set \Gamma intuitively means that under the circumstance of \Gamma, if P is true then some ""part"" of Q will also be true. We distinguish three different kinds of partial entailments and formalize them by using an extended notion of prime implicant. We study their semantic properties, which show that, surprisingly, partial entailments fail for many simple inference rules. Then, we study the related computational properties, which indicate that partial entailments are relatively difficult to be computed. Finally, we consider a potential application of partial entailments in reasoning about rational agents.",0
"In this paper, we present two methods to provide explanations for reasoning with belief functions in the valuation-based systems. One approach, inspired by Strat's method, is based on sensitivity analysis, but its computation is simpler thus easier to implement than Strat's. The other one is to examine the impact of evidence on the conclusion based on the measure of the information content in the evidence. We show the property of additivity for the pieces of evidence that are conditional independent within the context of the valuation-based systems. We will give an example to show how these approaches are applied in an evidential network.",0
"Human interactions are characterized by explicit as well as implicit channels of communication. While the explicit channel transmits overt messages, the implicit ones transmit hidden messages about the communicator (e.g., his/her intentions and attitudes). There is a growing consensus that providing a computer with the ability to manipulate implicit affective cues should allow for a more meaningful and natural way of studying particular non-verbal signals of human-human communications by human-computer interactions. In this pilot study, we created a non-dynamic human-computer interaction while manipulating three specific non-verbal channels of communication: gaze pattern, facial expression, and gesture. Participants rated the virtual agent on affective dimensional scales (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) while their physiological signal (electrodermal activity, EDA) was captured during the interaction. Assessment of the behavioral data revealed a significant and complex three-way interaction between gaze, gesture, and facial configuration on the dimension of pleasure, as well as a main effect of gesture on the dimension of dominance. These results suggest a complex relationship between different non-verbal cues and the social context in which they are interpreted. Qualifying considerations as well as possible next steps are further discussed in light of these exploratory findings.",0
"Heuristics used for solving hard real-time search problems have regions with depressions. Such regions are bounded areas of the search space in which the heuristic function is inaccurate compared to the actual cost to reach a solution. Early real-time search algorithms, like LRTA*, easily become trapped in those regions since the heuristic values of their states may need to be updated multiple times, which results in costly solutions. State-of-the-art real-time search algorithms, like LSS-LRTA* or LRTA*(k), improve LRTA*s mechanism to update the heuristic, resulting in improved performance. Those algorithms, however, do not guide search towards avoiding depressed regions. This paper presents depression avoidance, a simple real-time search principle to guide search towards avoiding states that have been marked as part of a heuristic depression. We propose two ways in which depression avoidance can be implemented: mark-and-avoid and move-to-border. We implement these strategies on top of LSS-LRTA* and RTAA*, producing 4 new real-time heuristic search algorithms: aLSS-LRTA*, daLSS-LRTA*, aRTAA*, and daRTAA*. When the objective is to find a single solution by running the real-time search algorithm once, we show that daLSS-LRTA* and daRTAA* outperform their predecessors sometimes by one order of magnitude. Of the four new algorithms, daRTAA* produces the best solutions given a fixed deadline on the average time allowed per planning episode. We prove all our algorithms have good theoretical properties: in finite search spaces, they find a solution if one exists, and converge to an optimal after a number of trials.",0
"Non-stationary domains, where unforeseen changes happen, present a challenge for agents to find an optimal policy for a sequential decision making problem. This work investigates a solution to this problem that combines Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) in a method we call ASP(RL). In this method, Answer Set Programming is used to find the possible trajectories of an MDP, from where Reinforcement Learning is applied to learn the optimal policy of the problem. Results show that ASP(RL) is capable of efficiently finding the optimal solution of an MDP representing non-stationary domains.",0
"During broadcast events such as the Superbowl, the U.S. Presidential and Primary debates, etc., Twitter has become the de facto platform for crowds to share perspectives and commentaries about them. Given an event and an associated large-scale collection of tweets, there are two fundamental research problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.",1
"In this paper we explore whether or not deep neural architectures can learn to classify Boolean satisfiability (SAT). We devote considerable time to discussing the theoretical properties of SAT. Then, we define a graph representation for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form, and train neural classifiers over general graph structures called Graph Neural Networks, or GNNs, to recognize features of satisfiability. To the best of our knowledge this has never been tried before. Our preliminary findings are potentially profound. In a weakly-supervised setting, that is, without problem specific feature engineering, Graph Neural Networks can learn features of satisfiability.",0
"This paper describes a new method for classifying a dataset that partitions elements into different categories. It has relations with neural networks but works in a different way, requiring only a single pass through the classifier to generate the weight sets. A grid structure is required and a novel idea of converting a row of real values into a 2-D or grid-like structure of value bands. Each cell in the band can then store a cell weight value and also a set of weights that represent its own importance to each of the output categories. For any input that needs to be categorised, all of the output weight lists for each relevant input cell can be retrieved and summed to produce a probability for what the correct output category is. So the relative importance of each input point to the output is distributed to each cell. The construction process itself can simply be the reinforcement of the weight values, without requiring an iterative adjustment process, making it potentially much faster.",0
"We document a connection between constraint reasoning and probabilistic reasoning. We present an algorithm, called {em probabilistic arc consistency}, which is both a generalization of a well known algorithm for arc consistency used in constraint reasoning, and a specialization of the belief updating algorithm for singly-connected networks. Our algorithm is exact for singly- connected constraint problems, but can work well as an approximation for arbitrary problems. We briefly discuss some empirical results, and related methods.",0
"The deontic logic DUS is a Deontic Update Semantics for prescriptive obligations based on the update semantics of Veltman. In DUS the definition of logical validity of obligations is not based on static truth values but on dynamic action transitions. In this paper prescriptive defeasible obligations are formalized in update semantics and the diagnostic problem of defeasible deontic logic is discussed. Assume a defeasible obligation `normally A ought to be (done)' together withthe fact `A is not (done).' Is this an exception of the normality claim, or is it a violation of the obligation? In this paper we formalize the heuristic principle that it is a violation, unless there is a more specific overriding obligation. The underlying motivation from legal reasoning is that criminals should have as little opportunities as possible to excuse themselves by claiming that their behavior was exceptional rather than criminal.",0
"Digital Elevation models (DEM) are images having terrain information embedded into them. Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding, Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for transformation and change detection. Landmarks have been categorized to belong to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. Fractal based compression was used for storage of co-registered DEMs. This method may further be extended for DEM-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM registration may be effectively done using the proposed method.",0
"We establish an equivalence between two seemingly different theories: one is the traditional axiomatisation of incomplete preferences on horse lotteries based on the mixture independence axiom; the other is the theory of desirable gambles developed in the context of imprecise probability. The equivalence allows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability and through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we obtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of incomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst act---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices too; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity assumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which enables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is always possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a worst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a trivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence coincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise probability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state independence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of complete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not capture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities and we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly, we argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to model, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean problems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference, should be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic axiomatisations.",0
"In this project we outline a modularized, scalable system for comparing Amazon products in an interactive and informative way using efficient latent variable models and dynamic visualization. We demonstrate how our system can build on the structure and rich review information of Amazon products in order to provide a fast, multifaceted, and intuitive comparison. By providing a condensed per-topic comparison visualization to the user, we are able to display aggregate information from the entire set of reviews while providing an interface that is at least as compact as the ""most helpful reviews"" currently displayed by Amazon, yet far more informative.",0
"Grounding is the task of reducing a first-order theory and finite domain to an equivalent propositional theory. It is used as preprocessing phase in many logic-based reasoning systems. Such systems provide a rich first-order input language to a user and can rely on efficient propositional solvers to perform the actual reasoning. Besides a first-order theory and finite domain, the input for grounders contains in many applications also additional data. By exploiting this data, the size of the grounders output can often be reduced significantly. A common practice to improve the efficiency of a grounder in this context is by manually adding semantically redundant information to the input theory, indicating where and when the grounder should exploit the data. In this paper we present a method to compute and add such redundant information automatically. Our method therefore simplifies the task of writing input theories that can be grounded efficiently by current systems. We first present our method for classical first-order logic (FO) theories. Then we extend it to FO(ID), the extension of FO with inductive definitions, which allows for more concise and comprehensive input theories. We discuss implementation issues and experimentally validate the practical applicability of our method.",0
"The histological assessment of human tissue has emerged as the key challenge for detection and treatment of cancer. A plethora of different data sources ranging from tissue microarray data to gene expression, proteomics or metabolomics data provide a detailed overview of the health status of a patient. Medical doctors need to assess these information sources and they rely on data driven automatic analysis tools. Methods for classification, grouping and segmentation of heterogeneous data sources as well as regression of noisy dependencies and estimation of survival probabilities enter the processing workflow of a pathology diagnosis system at various stages. This paper reports on state-of-the-art of the design and effectiveness of computational pathology workflows and it discusses future research directions in this emergent field of medical informatics and diagnostic machine learning.",0
Discovering the set of closed frequent patterns is one of the fundamental problems in Data Mining. Recent Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for declarative itemset mining have proven their usefulness and flexibility. But the wide use of reified constraints in current CP approaches raises many difficulties to cope with high dimensional datasets. This paper proposes CLOSED PATTERN global constraint which does not require any reified constraints nor any extra variables to encode efficiently the Closed Frequent Pattern Mining (CFPM) constraint. CLOSED-PATTERN captures the particular semantics of the CFPM problem in order to ensure a polynomial pruning algorithm ensuring domain consistency. The computational properties of our constraint are analyzed and their practical effectiveness is experimentally evaluated.,0
"This paper reviews an experiment in human-computer interaction, where interaction takes place when humans attempt to teach a computer to play a strategy board game. We show that while individually learned models can be shown to improve the playing performance of the computer, their straightforward composition results in diluting what was earlier learned. This observation suggests that interaction cannot be easily distributed when one hopes to harness multiple human experts to develop a quality computer player. This is related to similar approaches in robot task learning and to classic approaches to human learning and reinforces the need to develop tools that facilitate the mix of human-based tuition and computer self-learning.",0
"Formal synthesis is the process of generating a program satisfying a high-level specification. In recent times, effective formal synthesis methods have been proposed based on the use of inductive learning. We refer to this class of methods that learn programs from examples as formal inductive synthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal inductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from traditional machine learning. We then describe oracle-guided inductive synthesis (OGIS), a class of synthesizers that operate by iteratively querying an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had much practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We present a theoretical characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that computes a recursive language. In particular, we analyze the relative power of CEGIS variants where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle varies. We also consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory available to the learning algorithm. In the special case where the universe of candidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion of teaching dimension studied in machine learning theory. Altogether, the results of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the emerging field of formal inductive synthesis.",0
"We investigate planning in time-critical domains represented as Markov Decision Processes, showing that search based techniques can be a very powerful method for finding close to optimal plans. To reduce the computational cost of planning in these domains, we execute actions as we construct the plan, and sacrifice optimality by searching to a fixed depth and using a heuristic function to estimate the value of states. Although this paper concentrates on the search algorithm, we also discuss ways of constructing heuristic functions suitable for this approach. Our results show that by interleaving search and execution, close to optimal policies can be found without the computational requirements of other approaches.",0
"HEX-programs are an extension of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm incorporating external means of computation into the declarative programming language through so-called external atoms. Their semantics is defined in terms of minimal models of the Faber-Leone-Pfeifer (FLP) reduct. Developing native solvers for HEX-programs based on an appropriate notion of unfounded sets has been subject to recent research for reasons of efficiency. Although this has lead to an improvement over naive minimality checking using the FLP reduct, testing for foundedness remains a computationally expensive task. In this work we improve on HEX-program evaluation in this respect by identifying a syntactic class of programs, that can be efficiently recognized and allows to entirely skip the foundedness check. Moreover, we develop criteria for decomposing a program into components, such that the search for unfounded sets can be restricted. Observing that our results apply to many HEX-program applications provides analytic evidence for the significance and effectiveness of our approach, which is complemented by a brief discussion of preliminary experimental validation.",0
"Texture classification is one of the problems which has been paid much attention on by computer scientists since late 90s. If texture classification is done correctly and accurately, it can be used in many cases such as Pattern recognition, object tracking, and shape recognition. So far, there have been so many methods offered to solve this problem. Near all these methods have tried to extract and define features to separate different labels of textures really well. This article has offered an approach which has an overall process on the images of textures based on Local binary pattern and Gray Level Co-occurrence matrix and then by edge detection, and finally, extracting the statistical features from the images would classify them. Although, this approach is a general one and is could be used in different applications, the method has been tested on the stone texture and the results have been compared with some of the previous approaches to prove the quality of proposed approach.",0
"In pattern mining, the main challenge is the exponential explosion of the set of patterns. Typically, to solve this problem, a constraint for pattern selection is introduced. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints. In this paper we introduce the notion of ""generalized monotonicity"" and Sofia algorithm that allow generating best patterns in polynomial time for some nonmonotonic constraints modulo constraint computation and pattern extension operations. In particular, this algorithm is polynomial for data on itemsets and interval tuples. In this paper we consider stability and delta-measure which are nonmonotonic constraints and apply them to interval tuple datasets. In the experiments, we compute best interval tuple patterns w.r.t. these measures and show the advantage of our approach over postfiltering approaches.",0
"Most current planners assume complete domain models and focus on generating correct plans. Unfortunately, domain modeling is a laborious and error-prone task. While domain experts cannot guarantee completeness, often they are able to circumscribe the incompleteness of the model by providing annotations as to which parts of the domain model may be incomplete. In such cases, the goal should be to generate plans that are robust with respect to any known incompleteness of the domain. In this paper, we first introduce annotations expressing the knowledge of the domain incompleteness, and formalize the notion of plan robustness with respect to an incomplete domain model. We then propose an approach to compiling the problem of finding robust plans to the conformant probabilistic planning problem. We present experimental results with Probabilistic-FF, a state-of-the-art planner, showing the promise of our approach.",1
"We explore phase transitions of plan modification, which mainly focus on the conformant planning problems. By analyzing features of plan modification in conformant planning problems, quantitative results are obtained. If the number of operators is less than, almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved with plan modification. If the number of operators is more than, almost all conformant planning problems can be solved with plan modification. The results of the experiments also show that there exists an experimental threshold of density (ratio of number of operators to number of propositions), which separates the region where almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved with plan modification from the region where almost all conformant planning problems can be solved with plan modification.",0
"Optimal probabilistic approach in reinforcement learning is computationally infeasible. Its simplification consisting in neglecting difference between true environment and its model estimated using limited number of observations causes exploration vs exploitation problem. Uncertainty can be expressed in terms of a probability distribution over the space of environment models, and this uncertainty can be propagated to the action-value function via Bellman iterations, which are computationally insufficiently efficient though. We consider possibility of directly measuring uncertainty of the action-value function, and analyze sufficiency of this facilitated approach.",0
"Most exact methods for k-nearest neighbour search suffer from the curse of dimensionality; that is, their query times exhibit exponential dependence on either the ambient or the intrinsic dimensionality. Dynamic Continuous Indexing (DCI) offers a promising way of circumventing the curse by avoiding space partitioning and achieves a query time that grows sublinearly in the intrinsic dimensionality. In this paper, we develop a variant of DCI, which we call Prioritized DCI, and show a further improvement in the dependence on the intrinsic dimensionality compared to standard DCI, thereby improving the performance of DCI on datasets with high intrinsic dimensionality. We also demonstrate empirically that Prioritized DCI compares favourably to standard DCI and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) both in terms of running time and space consumption at all levels of approximation quality. In particular, relative to LSH, Prioritized DCI reduces the number of distance evaluations by a factor of 5 to 30 and the space consumption by a factor of 47 to 55.",1
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a widely spread disease all over the world. HCV has very high mutation rate that makes it resistant to antibodies. Modeling HCV to identify the virus mutation process is essential to its detection and predicting its evolution. This paper presents a model based framework for estimating mutation rate of HCV in two steps. Firstly profile hidden Markov model (PHMM) architecture was builder to select the sequences which represents sequence per year. Secondly mutation rate was calculated by using pair-wise distance method between sequences. A pilot study is conducted on NS5B zone of HCV dataset of genotype 4 subtype a (HCV4a) in Egypt.,0
"This paper addresses the problem of predicting the k events that are most likely to occur next, over historical real-time event streams. Existing approaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First, they exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely k effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect cyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to exclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the omission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these limitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a run-time causal inference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order absorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between two events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is a necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference mechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This is done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not exhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence model. This paper presents two query processing algorithms -- one performs exhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced search with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading blackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the probabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms. Specifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to exhaustive search, by 25-80% (depending on the application) with only a small reduction in accuracy.",0
"Smart home technology is a better choice for the people to care about security, comfort and power saving as well. It is required to develop technologies that recognize the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) of the residents at home and detect the abnormal behavior in the individual's patterns. Data mining techniques such as Frequent pattern mining (FPM), High Utility Pattern (HUP) Mining were used to find those activity patterns from the collected sensor data. But applying the above technique for Activity Recognition from the temporal sensor data stream is highly complex and challenging task. So, a new approach is proposed for activity recognition from sensor data stream which is achieved by constructing Frequent Pattern Stream tree (FPS - tree). FPS is a sliding window based approach to discover the recent activity patterns over time from data streams. The proposed work aims at identifying the frequent pattern of the user from the sensor data streams which are later modeled for activity recognition. The proposed FPM algorithm uses a data structure called Linked Sensor Data Stream (LSDS) for storing the sensor data stream information which increases the efficiency of frequent pattern mining algorithm through both space and time. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and this FPM is further extended for applying for power efficiency using HUP to detect the high usage of power consumption of residents at smart home.",0
"In this paper, we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous robots. We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line, we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to compare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning approaches.",0
"Controller synthesis for hybrid systems that satisfy temporal specifications expressing various system properties is a challenging problem that has drawn the attention of many researchers. However, making the assumption that such temporal properties are deterministic is far from the reality. For example, many of the properties the controller has to satisfy are learned through machine learning techniques based on sensor input data. In this paper, we propose a new logic, Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (PrSTL), as an expressive language to define the stochastic properties, and enforce probabilistic guarantees on them. We further show how to synthesize safe controllers using this logic for cyber-physical systems under the assumption that the stochastic properties are based on a set of Gaussian random variables. One of the key distinguishing features of PrSTL is that the encoded logic is adaptive and changes as the system encounters additional data and updates its beliefs about the latent random variables that define the safety properties. We demonstrate our approach by synthesizing safe controllers under the PrSTL specifications for multiple case studies including control of quadrotors and autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.",0
"Innate immunity now occupies a central role in immunology. However, artificial immune system models have largely been inspired by adaptive not innate immunity. This paper reviews the biological principles and properties of innate immunity and, adopting a conceptual framework, asks how these can be incorporated into artificial models. The aim is to outline a meta-framework for models of innate immunity.",0
"The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) is a well-known calculus for representing part-whole and topological relations. It plays an important role in qualitative spatial reasoning, geographical information science, and ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC has been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the consistency of RCC constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant RCC constraints. For a set $\Gamma$ of RCC constraints, we say a constraint $(x R y)$ in $\Gamma$ is redundant if it can be entailed by the rest of $\Gamma$. A prime network of $\Gamma$ is a subset of $\Gamma$ which contains no redundant constraints but has the same solution set as $\Gamma$. It is natural to ask how to compute a prime network, and when it is unique. In this paper, we show that this problem is in general co-NP hard, but becomes tractable if $\Gamma$ is over a tractable subclass of RCC. If $\mathcal{S}$ is a tractable subclass in which weak composition distributes over non-empty intersections, then we can show that $\Gamma$ has a unique prime network, which is obtained by removing all redundant constraints from $\Gamma$. As a byproduct, we identify a sufficient condition for a path-consistent network being minimal.",0
"Decentralized POMDPs provide an expressive framework for multi-agent sequential decision making. While fnite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed signifcant success, progress remains slow for the infnite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infnite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.",0
"We describe an application of belief networks to the diagnosis of bottlenecks in computer systems. The technique relies on a high-level functional model of the interaction between application workloads, the Windows NT operating system, and system hardware. Given a workload description, the model predicts the values of observable system counters available from the Windows NT performance monitoring tool. Uncertainty in workloads, predictions, and counter values are characterized with Gaussian distributions. During diagnostic inference, we use observed performance monitor values to find the most probable assignment to the workload parameters. In this paper we provide some background on automated bottleneck detection, describe the structure of the system model, and discuss empirical procedures for model calibration and verification. Part of the calibration process includes generating a dataset to estimate a multivariate Gaussian error model. Initial results in diagnosing bottlenecks are presented.",0
"Literature on Constraint Satisfaction exhibits the definition of several structural properties that can be possessed by CSPs, like (in)consistency, substitutability or interchangeability. Current tools for constraint solving typically detect such properties efficiently by means of incomplete yet effective algorithms, and use them to reduce the search space and boost search.",0
"The emergence of ""big data"" offers unprecedented opportunities for not only accelerating scientific advances but also enabling new modes of discovery. Scientific progress in many disciplines is increasingly enabled by our ability to examine natural phenomena through the computational lens, i.e., using algorithmic or information processing abstractions of the underlying processes; and our ability to acquire, share, integrate and analyze disparate types of data. However, there is a huge gap between our ability to acquire, store, and process data and our ability to make effective use of the data to advance discovery. Despite successful automation of routine aspects of data management and analytics, most elements of the scientific process currently require considerable human expertise and effort. Accelerating science to keep pace with the rate of data acquisition and data processing calls for the development of algorithmic or information processing abstractions, coupled with formal methods and tools for modeling and simulation of natural processes as well as major innovations in cognitive tools for scientists, i.e., computational tools that leverage and extend the reach of human intellect, and partner with humans on a broad range of tasks in scientific discovery (e.g., identifying, prioritizing formulating questions, designing, prioritizing and executing experiments designed to answer a chosen question, drawing inferences and evaluating the results, and formulating new questions, in a closed-loop fashion). This calls for concerted research agenda aimed at: Development, analysis, integration, sharing, and simulation of algorithmic or information processing abstractions of natural processes, coupled with formal methods and tools for their analyses and simulation; Innovations in cognitive tools that augment and extend human intellect and partner with humans in all aspects of science.",0
"In many applications of computer algebra large expressions must be simplified to make repeated numerical evaluations tractable. Previous works presented heuristically guided improvements, e.g., for Horner schemes. The remaining expression is then further reduced by common subexpression elimination. A recent approach successfully applied a relatively new algorithm, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCT as the selection criterion, to find better variable orderings. Yet, this approach is fit for further improvements since it is sensitive to the so-called exploration-exploitation constant $C_p$ and the number of tree updates $N$. In this paper we propose a new selection criterion called Simulated Annealing UCT (SA-UCT) that has a dynamic exploration-exploitation parameter, which decreases with the iteration number $i$ and thus reduces the importance of exploration over time. First, we provide an intuitive explanation in terms of the exploration-exploitation behavior of the algorithm. Then, we test our algorithm on three large expressions of different origins. We observe that SA-UCT widens the interval of good initial values $C_p$ where best results are achieved. The improvement is large (more than a tenfold) and facilitates the selection of an appropriate $C_p$.",0
"We discuss representing and reasoning with knowledge about the time-dependent utility of an agent's actions. Time-dependent utility plays a crucial role in the interaction between computation and action under bounded resources. We present a semantics for time-dependent utility and describe the use of time-dependent information in decision contexts. We illustrate our discussion with examples of time-pressured reasoning in Protos, a system constructed to explore the ideal control of inference by reasoners with limit abilities.",0
"Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships are useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform knowledge base completion, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This article presents an overview of embedding models of entities and relationships for knowledge base completion, with up-to-date experimental results on two standard evaluation tasks of link prediction (i.e. entity prediction) and triple classification.",0
"This paper focuses on a system, WOLFIE (WOrd Learning From Interpreted Examples), that acquires a semantic lexicon from a corpus of sentences paired with semantic representations. The lexicon learned consists of phrases paired with meaning representations. WOLFIE is part of an integrated system that learns to transform sentences into representations such as logical database queries. Experimental results are presented demonstrating WOLFIE's ability to learn useful lexicons for a database interface in four different natural languages. The usefulness of the lexicons learned by WOLFIE are compared to those acquired by a similar system, with results favorable to WOLFIE. A second set of experiments demonstrates WOLFIE's ability to scale to larger and more difficult, albeit artificially generated, corpora. In natural language acquisition, it is difficult to gather the annotated data needed for supervised learning; however, unannotated data is fairly plentiful. Active learning methods attempt to select for annotation and training only the most informative examples, and therefore are potentially very useful in natural language applications. However, most results to date for active learning have only considered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to semantic lexicons. We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given level of performance.",0
"Deep-layered models trained on a large number of labeled samples boost the accuracy of many tasks. It is important to apply such models to different domains because collecting many labeled samples in various domains is expensive. In unsupervised domain adaptation, one needs to train a classifier that works well on a target domain when provided with labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. Although many methods aim to match the distributions of source and target samples, simply matching the distribution cannot ensure accuracy on the target domain. To learn discriminative representations for the target domain, we assume that artificially labeling target samples can result in a good representation. Tri-training leverages three classifiers equally to give pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, but the method does not assume labeling samples generated from a different domain.In this paper, we propose an asymmetric tri-training method for unsupervised domain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and train neural networks as if they are true labels. In our work, we use three networks asymmetrically. By asymmetric, we mean that two networks are used to label unlabeled target samples and one network is trained by the samples to obtain target-discriminative representations. We evaluate our method on digit recognition and sentiment analysis datasets. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark digit recognition datasets of domain adaptation.",1
"Linear Programming (LP) relaxations have become powerful tools for finding the most probable (MAP) configuration in graphical models. These relaxations can be solved efficiently using message-passing algorithms such as belief propagation and, when the relaxation is tight, provably find the MAP configuration. The standard LP relaxation is not tight enough in many real-world problems, however, and this has lead to the use of higher order cluster-based LP relaxations. The computational cost increases exponentially with the size of the clusters and limits the number and type of clusters we can use. We propose to solve the cluster selection problem monotonically in the dual LP, iteratively selecting clusters with guaranteed improvement, and quickly re-solving with the added clusters by reusing the existing solution. Our dual message-passing algorithm finds the MAP configuration in protein sidechain placement, protein design, and stereo problems, in cases where the standard LP relaxation fails.",0
"This paper describes a new information-theoretic policy evaluation technique for reinforcement learning. This technique converts any compression or density model into a corresponding estimate of value. Under appropriate stationarity and ergodicity conditions, we show that the use of a sufficiently powerful model gives rise to a consistent value function estimator. We also study the behavior of this technique when applied to various Atari 2600 video games, where the use of suboptimal modeling techniques is unavoidable. We consider three fundamentally different models, all too limited to perfectly model the dynamics of the system. Remarkably, we find that our technique provides sufficiently accurate value estimates for effective on-policy control. We conclude with a suggestive study highlighting the potential of our technique to scale to large problems.",1
"In this work, we formulated a real-world problem related to sewer pipeline gas detection using the classification-based approaches. The primary goal of this work was to identify the hazardousness of sewer pipeline to offer safe and non-hazardous access to sewer pipeline workers so that the human fatalities, which occurs due to the toxic exposure of sewer gas components, can be avoided. The dataset acquired through laboratory tests, experiments, and various literature sources was organized to design a predictive model that was able to identify/classify hazardous and non-hazardous situation of sewer pipeline. To design such prediction model, several classification algorithms were used and their performances were evaluated and compared, both empirically and statistically, over the collected dataset. In addition, the performances of several ensemble methods were analyzed to understand the extent of improvement offered by these methods. The result of this comprehensive study showed that the instance-based learning algorithm performed better than many other algorithms such as multilayer perceptron, radial basis function network, support vector machine, reduced pruning tree. Similarly, it was observed that multi-scheme ensemble approach enhanced the performance of base predictors.",0
"Nearly all previous work on geo-locating latent states and activities from social media confounds general discussions about activities, self-reports of users participating in those activities at times in the past or future, and self-reports made at the immediate time and place the activity occurs. Activities, such as alcohol consumption, may occur at different places and types of places, and it is important not only to detect the local regions where these activities occur, but also to analyze the degree of participation in them by local residents. In this paper, we develop new machine learning based methods for fine-grained localization of activities and home locations from Twitter data. We apply these methods to discover and compare alcohol consumption patterns in a large urban area, New York City, and a more suburban and rural area, Monroe County. We find positive correlations between the rate of alcohol consumption reported among a community's Twitter users and the density of alcohol outlets, demonstrating that the degree of correlation varies significantly between urban and suburban areas. While our experiments are focused on alcohol use, our methods for locating homes and distinguishing temporally-specific self-reports are applicable to a broad range of behaviors and latent states.",0
"Human trafficking is one of the most atrocious crimes and among the challenging problems facing law enforcement which demands attention of global magnitude. In this study, we leverage textual data from the website ""Backpage""- used for classified advertisement- to discern potential patterns of human trafficking activities which manifest online and identify advertisements of high interest to law enforcement. Due to the lack of ground truth, we rely on a human analyst from law enforcement, for hand-labeling a small portion of the crawled data. We extend the existing Laplacian SVM and present S3VM-R, by adding a regularization term to exploit exogenous information embedded in our feature space in favor of the task at hand. We train the proposed method using labeled and unlabeled data and evaluate it on a fraction of the unlabeled data, herein referred to as unseen data, with our expert's further verification. Results from comparisons between our method and other semi-supervised and supervised approaches on the labeled data demonstrate that our learner is effective in identifying advertisements of high interest to law enforcement",0
"This paper analyzes irrelevance and independence relations in graphical models associated with convex sets of probability distributions (called Quasi-Bayesian networks). The basic question in Quasi-Bayesian networks is, How can irrelevance/independence relations in Quasi-Bayesian networks be detected, enforced and exploited? This paper addresses these questions through Walley's definitions of irrelevance and independence. Novel algorithms and results are presented for inferences with the so-called natural extensions using fractional linear programming, and the properties of the so-called type-1 extensions are clarified through a new generalization of d-separation.",0
"Internship assignment is a complicated process for universities since it is necessary to take into account a multiplicity of variables to establish a compromise between companies' requirements and student competencies acquired during the university training. These variables build up a complex relations map that requires the formulation of an exhaustive and rigorous conceptual scheme. In this research a domain ontological model is presented as support to the student's decision making for opportunities of University studies level of the University Lumiere Lyon 2 (ULL) education system. The ontology is designed and created using methodological approach offering the possibility of improving the progressive creation, capture and knowledge articulation. In this paper, we draw a balance taking the demands of the companies across the capabilities of the students. This will be done through the establishment of an ontological model of an educational learners' profile and the internship postings which are written in a free text and using uncontrolled vocabulary. Furthermore, we outline the process of semantic matching which improves the quality of query results.",0
"For many real time applications, it is important to validate the information received from the sensors before entering higher levels of reasoning. This paper presents an any time probabilistic algorithm for validating the information provided by sensors. The system consists of two Bayesian network models. The first one is a model of the dependencies between sensors and it is used to validate each sensor. It provides a list of potentially faulty sensors. To isolate the real faults, a second Bayesian network is used, which relates the potential faults with the real faults. This second model is also used to make the validation algorithm any time, by validating first the sensors that provide more information. To select the next sensor to validate, and measure the quality of the results at each stage, an entropy function is used. This function captures in a single quantity both the certainty and specificity measures of any time algorithms. Together, both models constitute a mechanism for validating sensors in an any time fashion, providing at each step the probability of correct/faulty for each sensor, and the total quality of the results. The algorithm has been tested in the validation of temperature sensors of a power plant.",0
"Despite the prevalence of the Computational Theory of Mind and the Connectionist Model, the establishing of the key principles of the Cognitive Science are still controversy and inconclusive.

"Inferring a cause from its effect using observed time series data is a major challenge in natural and social sciences. Assuming the effect is generated by the cause trough a linear system, we propose a new approach based on the hypothesis that nature chooses the ""cause"" and the ""mechanism that generates the effect from the cause"" independent of each other. We therefore postulate that the power spectrum of the time series being the cause is uncorrelated with the square of the transfer function of the linear filter generating the effect. While most causal discovery methods for time series mainly rely on the noise, our method relies on asymmetries of the power spectral density properties that can be exploited even in the context of deterministic systems. We describe mathematical assumptions in a deterministic model under which the causal direction is identifiable with this approach. We also discuss the method's performance under the additive noise model and its relationship to Granger causality. Experiments show encouraging results on synthetic as well as real-world data. Overall, this suggests that the postulate of Independence of Cause and Mechanism is a promising principle for causal inference on empirical time series.",1
"Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity. However, automating human expertise remains elusive, for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels. Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning.",1
"The broader goal of our research is to formulate answers to why and how questions with respect to knowledge bases, such as AURA. One issue we face when reasoning with many available knowledge bases is that at times needed information is missing. Examples of this include partially missing information about next sub-event, first sub-event, last sub-event, result of an event, input to an event, destination of an event, and raw material involved in an event. In many cases one can recover part of the missing knowledge through reasoning. In this paper we give a formal definition about how such missing information can be recovered and then give an ASP implementation of it. We then discuss the implication of this with respect to answering why and how questions.",0

"This paper investigates the problems arising in the construction of a program to play the game of contract bridge. These problems include both the difficulty of solving the game's perfect information variant, and techniques needed to address the fact that bridge is not, in fact, a perfect information game. GIB, the program being described, involves five separate technical advances: partition search, the practical application of Monte Carlo techniques to realistic problems, a focus on achievable sets to solve problems inherent in the Monte Carlo approach, an extension of alpha-beta pruning from total orders to arbitrary distributive lattices, and the use of squeaky wheel optimization to find approximately optimal solutions to cardplay problems. GIB is currently believed to be of approximately expert caliber, and is currently the strongest computer bridge program in the world.",0
"The problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks from complete discrete data with a limit on parent set size is considered. Learning is cast explicitly as an optimisation problem where the goal is to find a BN structure which maximises log marginal likelihood (BDe score). Integer programming, specifically the SCIP framework, is used to solve this optimisation problem. Acyclicity constraints are added to the integer program (IP) during solving in the form of cutting planes. Finding good cutting planes is the key to the success of the approach -the search for such cutting planes is effected using a sub-IP. Results show that this is a particularly fast method for exact BN learning.",0
"In this paper we present the Transalg system, designed to produce SAT encodings for discrete functions, written as programs in a specific language.

We used the Transalg system to make SAT encodings for a number of cryptographic functions.",0
"Model transformations operate on models conforming to precisely defined metamodels. Consequently, it often seems relatively easy to chain them: the output of a transformation may be given as input to a second one if metamodels match. However, this simple rule has some obvious limitations. For instance, a transformation may only use a subset of a metamodel. Therefore, chaining transformations appropriately requires more information. We present here an approach that automatically discovers more detailed information about actual chaining constraints by statically analyzing transformations. The objective is to provide developers who decide to chain transformations with more data on which to base their choices. This approach has been successfully applied to the case of a library of endogenous transformations. They all have the same source and target metamodel but have some hidden chaining constraints. In such a case, the simple metamodel matching rule given above does not provide any useful information.",0
"In this paper, we address the problem of enumerating all models of a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). We propose an extension of CDCL-based SAT solvers to deal with this fundamental problem. Then, we provide an experimental evaluation of our proposed SAT model enumeration algorithms on both satisfiable SAT instances taken from the last SAT challenge and on instances from the SAT-based encoding of sequence mining problems.",0
"Major advances have recently been made in merging language and vision representations. But most tasks considered so far have confined themselves to the processing of objects and lexicalised relations amongst objects (content words). We know, however, that humans (even pre-school children) can abstract over raw data to perform certain types of higher-level reasoning, expressed in natural language by function words. A case in point is given by their ability to learn quantifiers, i.e. expressions like 'few', 'some' and 'all'. From formal semantics and cognitive linguistics, we know that quantifiers are relations over sets which, as a simplification, we can see as proportions. For instance, in 'most fish are red', most encodes the proportion of fish which are red fish. In this paper, we study how well current language and vision strategies model such relations. We show that state-of-the-art attention mechanisms coupled with a traditional linguistic formalisation of quantifiers gives best performance on the task. Additionally, we provide insights on the role of 'gist' representations in quantification. A 'logical' strategy to tackle the task would be to first obtain a numerosity estimation for the two involved sets and then compare their cardinalities. We however argue that precisely identifying the composition of the sets is not only beyond current state-of-the-art models but perhaps even detrimental to a task that is most efficiently performed by refining the approximate numerosity estimator of the system.",0
"To cope with the high level of ambiguity faced in domains such as Computer Vision or Natural Language processing, robust prediction methods often search for a diverse set of high-quality candidate solutions or proposals. In structured prediction problems, this becomes a daunting task, as the solution space (image labelings, sentence parses, etc.) is exponentially large. We study greedy algorithms for finding a diverse subset of solutions in structured-output spaces by drawing new connections between submodular functions over combinatorial item sets and High-Order Potentials (HOPs) studied for graphical models. Specifically, we show via examples that when marginal gains of submodular diversity functions allow structured representations, this enables efficient (sub-linear time) approximate maximization by reducing the greedy augmentation step to inference in a factor graph with appropriately constructed HOPs. We discuss benefits, tradeoffs, and show that our constructions lead to significantly better proposals.",1
"Ever growing number of image documents available on the Internet continuously motivates research in better annotation models and more efficient retrieval methods. Formal knowledge representation of objects and events in pictures, their interaction as well as context complexity becomes no longer an option for a quality image repository, but a necessity. We present an ontology-based online image annotation tool WNtags and demonstrate its usefulness in several typical multimedia retrieval tasks using International Affective Picture System emotionally annotated image database. WNtags is built around WordNet lexical ontology but considers Suggested Upper Merged Ontology as the preferred labeling formalism. WNtags uses sets of weighted WordNet synsets as high-level image semantic descriptors and query matching is performed with word stemming and node distance metrics. We also elaborate our near future plans to expand image content description with induced affect as in stimuli for research of human emotion and attention.",0
"This paper describes a novel approach to planning which takes advantage of decision theory to greatly improve robustness in an uncertain environment. We present an algorithm which computes conditional plans of maximum expected utility. This algorithm relies on a representation of the search space as an AND/OR tree and employs a depth-limit to control computation costs. A numeric robustness factor, which parameterizes the utility function, allows the user to modulate the degree of risk-aversion employed by the planner. Via a look-ahead search, the planning algorithm seeks to find an optimal plan using expected utility as its optimization criterion. We present experimental results obtained by applying our algorithm to a non-deterministic extension of the blocks world domain. Our results demonstrate that the robustness factor governs the degree of risk embodied in the conditional plans computed by our algorithm.",0
"In probabilistic logic entailments, even moderate size problems can yield linear constraint systems with so many variables that exact methods are impractical. This difficulty can be remedied in many cases of interest by introducing a three valued logic (true, false, and ""don't care""). The three-valued approach allows the construction of ""compressed"" constraint systems which have the same solution sets as their two-valued counterparts, but which may involve dramatically fewer variables. Techniques to calculate point estimates for the posterior probabilities of entailed sentences are discussed.",0

In addition, we present some preliminary results of the pre-assessment system evaluation. From the results, it is gathered that the system has performed according to its design specification.",0
"In this paper a high speed neural network classifier based on extreme learning machines for multi-label classification problem is proposed and dis-cussed. Multi-label classification is a superset of traditional binary and multi-class classification problems. The proposed work extends the extreme learning machine technique to adapt to the multi-label problems. As opposed to the single-label problem, both the number of labels the sample belongs to, and each of those target labels are to be identified for multi-label classification resulting in in-creased complexity. The proposed high speed multi-label classifier is applied to six benchmark datasets comprising of different application areas such as multi-media, text and biology. The training time and testing time of the classifier are compared with those of the state-of-the-arts methods. Experimental studies show that for all the six datasets, our proposed technique have faster execution speed and better performance, thereby outperforming all the existing multi-label clas-sification methods.",0
"Finding inclusion-minimal ""hitting sets"" for a given collection of sets is a fundamental combinatorial problem with applications in domains as diverse as Boolean algebra, computational biology, and data mining. Much of the algorithmic literature focuses on the problem of *recognizing* the collection of minimal hitting sets; however, in many of the applications, it is more important to *generate* these hitting sets. We survey twenty algorithms from across a variety of domains, considering their history, classification, useful features, and computational performance on a variety of synthetic and real-world inputs. We also provide a suite of implementations of these algorithms with a ready-to-use, platform-agnostic interface based on Docker containers and the AlgoRun framework, so that interested computational scientists can easily perform similar tests with inputs from their own research areas on their own computers or through a convenient Web interface.",0
"A model of story generation recently proposed by Riedl and Young casts it as planning, with the additional condition that story characters behave intentionally. This means that characters have perceivable motivation for the actions they take. I show that this condition can be compiled away (in more ways than one) to produce a classical planning problem that can be solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner, more efficiently than by Riedl and Youngs specialised planner.",0
"Computational creativity is a subfield of AI focused on developing and studying creative systems. Few academic studies analysing the behaviour of creative agents from a theoretical viewpoint have been proposed. The proposed frameworks are vague and hard to exploit; moreover, such works are focused on a notion of creativity tailored for humans.",0
"Through history, the human being tried to relay its daily tasks to other creatures, which was the main reason behind the rise of civilizations. It started with deploying animals to automate tasks in the field of agriculture(bulls), transportation (e.g. horses and donkeys), and even communication (pigeons). Millenniums after, come the Golden age with ""Al-jazari"" and other Muslim inventors, which were the pioneers of automation, this has given birth to industrial revolution in Europe, centuries after. At the end of the nineteenth century, a new era was to begin, the computational era, the most advanced technological and scientific development that is driving the mankind and the reason behind all the evolutions of science; such as medicine, communication, education, and physics. At this edge of technology engineers and scientists are trying to model a machine that behaves the same as they do, which pushed us to think about designing and implementing ""Things that-Thinks"", then artificial intelligence was. In this work we will cover each of the major discoveries and studies in the field of machine cognition, which are the ""Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer""(EPAM) and ""The General Problem Solver""(GPS). The First one focus mainly on implementing the human-verbal learning behavior, while the second one tries to model an architecture that is able to solve problems generally (e.g. theorem proving, chess playing, and arithmetic). We will cover the major goals and the main ideas of each model, as well as comparing their strengths and weaknesses, and finally giving their fields of applications. And Finally, we will suggest a real life implementation of a cognitive machine.",0
"Chemical multisensor devices need calibration algorithms to estimate gas concentrations. Their possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues, including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, espe- cially for wearables and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches. We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming lin- ear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm, on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever prompt and precise response is needed.",0
"Today, one's disposes of large datasets composed of thousands of geographic objects. However, for many processes, which require the appraisal of an expert or much computational time, only a small part of these objects can be taken into account. In this context, robust sampling methods become necessary. In this paper, we propose a sampling method based on clustering techniques. Our method consists in dividing the objects in clusters, then in selecting in each cluster, the most representative objects. A case-study in the context of a process dedicated to knowledge revision for geographic data generalisation is presented. This case-study shows that our method allows to select relevant samples of objects.",0
"A prediction market is a useful means of aggregating information about a future event. To function, the market needs a trusted entity who will verify the true outcome in the end. Motivated by the recent introduction of decentralized prediction markets, we introduce a mechanism that allows for the outcome to be determined by the votes of a group of arbiters who may themselves hold stakes in the market. Despite the potential conflict of interest, we derive conditions under which we can incentivize arbiters to vote truthfully by using funds raised from market fees to implement a peer prediction mechanism. Finally, we investigate what parameter values could be used in a real-world implementation of our mechanism.",1
"We consider manipulation problems when the manipulator only has partial information about the votes of the nonmanipulators. Such partial information is described by an information set, which is the set of profiles of the nonmanipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an information set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the manipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully. When the manipulator has full information, computing whether or not there exists a dominating manipulation is in P for many common voting rules (by known results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no dominating manipulation for many common voting rules. When the manipulator's information is represented by partial orders and only a small portion of the preferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for many common voting rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other voters.",1
"Software testing is a prime factor in software industry. Besides knowing the importance of testing, only limited time is allocated for teaching it. It will be more efficient if testing is taught simultaneously with programming foundations. This integrated learning of testing techniques and programming allows the programmers to perform in a better way and this leads to the improvement of the performance of the industry progress. In this paper, a technique named ontology is introduced, it first defines the various testing process in hierarchy and define relationships among them, to share and reuse the knowledge that is captured, secondly metadata is created by natural language processing and finally, the application use ontologies to support test management, it act as knowledge base for multiple environment with the integrated teaching of programming foundation and testing concepts.

"Bayesian networks leverage conditional independence to compactly encode joint probability distributions. Many learning algorithms exploit the constraints implied by observed conditional independencies to learn the structure of Bayesian networks. The rules of d-separation provide a theoretical and algorithmic framework for deriving conditional independence facts from model structure. However, this theory only applies to Bayesian networks. Many real-world systems, such as social or economic systems, are characterized by interacting heterogeneous entities and probabilistic dependencies that cross the boundaries of entities. Consequently, researchers have developed extensions to Bayesian networks that can represent these relational dependencies. We show that the theory of d-separation inaccurately infers conditional independence when applied directly to the structure of probabilistic models of relational data. We introduce relational d-separation, a theory for deriving conditional independence facts from relational models. We provide a new representation, the abstract ground graph, that enables a sound, complete, and computationally efficient method for answering d-separation queries about relational models, and we present empirical results that demonstrate effectiveness.",0
"This paper presents Dempster-Shafer theory for move prediction in start kicking of the bicycle kick of sepak takraw game. Sepak takraw is a highly complex net-barrier kicking sport that involves dazzling displays of quick reflexes, acrobatic twists, turns and swerves of the agile human body movement. A Bicycle kick or Scissor kick is a physical move made by throwing the body up into the air, making a shearing movement with the legs to get one leg in front of the other without holding on to the ground. Specifically, this paper considers bicycle kick of sepak takraw game in start kicking of the ball with uncertainty where player has different awareness regarding the contingencies. We have chosen Dempster-Shafer theory because the advantages of the Dempster-Shafer theory which include the ability to model information in a flexible way without requiring a probability to be assigned to each element in a set, providing a convenient and simple mechanism for combining two or more pieces of evidence under certain conditions, it can model ignorance explicitly, rejection of the law of additivity for belief in disjoint propositions.",0
"Recommendation emails are among the best ways to re-engage with customers after they have left a website. While on-site recommendation systems focus on finding the most relevant items for a user at the moment (right item), email recommendations add two critical additional dimensions: who to send recommendations to (right person) and when to send them (right time). It is critical that a recommendation email system not send too many emails to too many users in too short of a time-window, as users may unsubscribe from future emails or become desensitized and ignore future emails if they receive too many. Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of their users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email recommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a minimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of such a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system that not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination of individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which they belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any given set of recommendations within a given time period. In doing this, we have effectively created a meta-recommendation system which recommends sets of recommendations in order to optimize the aggregate response rate of the entire system. The proposed technique has been applied successfully within CareerBuilder's job recommendation email system to generate a 50\% increase in total conversions while also decreasing sent emails by 72%",0
"In this paper, we describe an approach that enables an autonomous system to infer the semantics of a command (i.e. a symbol sequence representing an action) in terms of the relations between changes in the observations and the action instances. We present a method of how to induce a theory (i.e. a semantic description) of the meaning of a command in terms of a minimal set of background knowledge. The only thing we have is a sequence of observations from which we extract what kinds of effects were caused by performing the command. This way, we yield a description of the semantics of the action and, hence, a definition.",0
This article provides a formalization of the W3C Draft Core SHACL Semantics specification using Z notation. This formalization exercise has identified a number of quality issues in the draft. It has also established that the recursive definitions in the draft are well-founded. Further formal validation of the draft will require the use of an executable specification technology.,0
"In this paper, we focus on a novel knowledge reuse scenario where the knowledge in the source schema needs to be translated to a semantically heterogeneous target schema. We refer to this task as ""knowledge translation"" (KT). Unlike data translation and transfer learning, KT does not require any data from the source or target schema. We adopt a probabilistic approach to KT by representing the knowledge in the source schema, the mapping between the source and target schemas, and the resulting knowledge in the target schema all as probability distributions, specially using Markov random fields and Markov logic networks. Given the source knowledge and mappings, we use standard learning and inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models to find an explicit probability distribution in the target schema that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the implicit distribution. This gives us a compact probabilistic model that represents knowledge from the source schema as well as possible, respecting the uncertainty in both the source knowledge and the mapping. In experiments on both propositional and relational domains, we find that the knowledge obtained by KT is comparable to other approaches that require data, demonstrating that knowledge can be reused without data.",1
In this paper fuzzy VRPTW with an uncertain travel time is considered. Credibility theory is used to model the problem and specifies a preference index at which it is desired that the travel times to reach the customers fall into their time windows. We propose the integration of fuzzy and ant colony system based evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem while preserving the constraints. Computational results for certain benchmark problems having short and long time horizons are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm. Comparison between different preferences indexes have been obtained to help the user in making suitable decisions.,0
"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) exploits temporal abstraction to solve large Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and provide transferable subtask policies. In this paper, we introduce an off-policy HRL algorithm: Hierarchical Q-value Iteration (HQI). We show that it is possible to effectively learn recursive optimal policies for any valid hierarchical decomposition of the original MDP, given a fixed dataset collected from a flat stochastic behavioral policy. We first formally prove the convergence of the algorithm for tabular MDP. Then our experiments on the Taxi domain show that HQI converges faster than a flat Q-value Iteration and enjoys easy state abstraction. Also, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to learn optimal policies for different hierarchical structures from the same fixed dataset, which enables model comparison without recollecting data.",0
"We present MultiGain, a tool to synthesize strategies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) with multiple mean-payoff objectives. Our models are described in PRISM, and our tool uses the existing interface and simulator of PRISM. Our tool extends PRISM by adding novel algorithms for multiple mean-payoff objectives, and also provides features such as (i)~generating strategies and exploring them for simulation, and checking them with respect to other properties; and (ii)~generating an approximate Pareto curve for two mean-payoff objectives. In addition, we present a new practical algorithm for the analysis of MDPs with multiple mean-payoff objectives under memoryless strategies.",0
"We present a new concept - Wikiometrics - the derivation of metrics and indicators from Wikipedia. Wikipedia provides an accurate representation of the real world due to its size, structure, editing policy and popularity. We demonstrate an innovative mining methodology, where different elements of Wikipedia - content, structure, editorial actions and reader reviews - are used to rank items in a manner which is by no means inferior to rankings produced by experts or other methods. We test our proposed method by applying it to two real-world ranking problems: top world universities and academic journals. Our proposed ranking methods were compared to leading and widely accepted benchmarks, and were found to be extremely correlative but with the advantage of the data being publically available.",0
We propose a new task-specification language for Markov decision processes that is designed to be an improvement over reward functions by being environment independent. The language is a variant of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that is extended to probabilistic specifications in a way that permits approximations to be learned in finite time. We provide several small environments that demonstrate the advantages of our geometric LTL (GLTL) language and illustrate how it can be used to specify standard reinforcement-learning tasks straightforwardly.,0
"We consider a problem of prediction based on opinions elicited from heterogeneous rational agents with private information. Making an accurate prediction with a minimal cost requires a joint design of the incentive mechanism and the prediction algorithm. Such a problem lies at the nexus of statistical learning theory and game theory, and arises in many domains such as consumer surveys and mobile crowdsourcing. In order to elicit heterogeneous agents' private information and incentivize agents with different capabilities to act in the principal's best interest, we design an optimal joint incentive mechanism and prediction algorithm called COPE (COst and Prediction Elicitation), the analysis of which offers several valuable engineering insights. First, when the costs incurred by the agents are linear in the exerted effort, COPE corresponds to a ""crowd contending"" mechanism, where the principal only employs the agent with the highest capability. Second, when the costs are quadratic, COPE corresponds to a ""crowd-sourcing"" mechanism that employs multiple agents with different capabilities at the same time. Numerical simulations show that COPE improves the principal's profit and the network profit significantly (larger than 30% in our simulations), comparing to those mechanisms that assume all agents have equal capabilities.",0
"All solutions SAT (AllSAT for short) is a variant of propositional satisfiability problem. Despite its significance, AllSAT has been relatively unexplored compared to other variants. We thus survey and discuss major techniques of AllSAT solvers. We faithfully implement them and conduct comprehensive experiments using a large number of instances and various types of solvers including one of the few public softwares. The experiments reveal solver's characteristics. Our implemented solvers are made publicly available so that other researchers can easily develop their solver by modifying our codes and compare it with existing methods.",0
"Stochastic games generalize Markov decision processes (MDPs) to a multiagent setting by allowing the state transitions to depend jointly on all player actions, and having rewards determined by multiplayer matrix games at each state. We consider the problem of computing Nash equilibria in stochastic games, the analogue of planning in MDPs. We begin by providing a generalization of finite-horizon value iteration that computes a Nash strategy for each player in generalsum stochastic games. The algorithm takes an arbitrary Nash selection function as input, which allows the translation of local choices between multiple Nash equilibria into the selection of a single global Nash equilibrium.",0
"Visual question answering (or VQA) is a new and exciting problem that combines natural language processing and computer vision techniques. We present a survey of the various datasets and models that have been used to tackle this task. The first part of the survey details the various datasets for VQA and compares them along some common factors. The second part of this survey details the different approaches for VQA, classified into four types: non-deep learning models, deep learning models without attention, deep learning models with attention, and other models which do not fit into the first three. Finally, we compare the performances of these approaches and provide some directions for future work.",0
"The Google DeepMind challenge match in March 2016 was a historic achievement for computer Go development. This article discusses the development of computational intelligence (CI) and its relative strength in comparison with human intelligence for the game of Go. We first summarize the milestones achieved for computer Go from 1998 to 2016. Then, the computer Go programs that have participated in previous IEEE CIS competitions as well as methods and techniques used in AlphaGo are briefly introduced. Commentaries from three high-level professional Go players on the five AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol games are also included. We conclude that AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol is a huge achievement in artificial intelligence (AI) based largely on CI methods. In the future, powerful computer Go programs such as AlphaGo are expected to be instrumental in promoting Go education and AI real-world applications.",0
"We consider the problem of bottom-up compilation of knowledge bases, which is usually predicated on the existence of a polytime function for combining compilations using Boolean operators (usually called an Apply function). While such a polytime Apply function is known to exist for certain languages (e.g., OBDDs) and not exist for others (e.g., DNNF), its existence for certain languages remains unknown. Among the latter is the recently introduced language of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs), for which a polytime Apply function exists for unreduced SDDs, but remains unknown for reduced ones (i.e. canonical SDDs). We resolve this open question in this paper and consider some of its theoretical and practical implications. Some of the findings we report question the common wisdom on the relationship between bottom-up compilation, language canonicity and the complexity of the Apply function.",1
"Data originating from the Web, sensor readings and social media result in increasingly huge datasets. The so called Big Data comes with new scientific and technological challenges while creating new opportunities, hence the increasing interest in academia and industry. Traditionally, logic programming has focused on complex knowledge structures/programs, so the question arises whether and how it can work in the face of Big Data. In this paper, we examine how the well-founded semantics can process huge amounts of data through mass parallelization. More specifically, we propose and evaluate a parallel approach using the MapReduce framework. Our experimental results indicate that our approach is scalable and that well-founded semantics can be applied to billions of facts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses large scale nonmonotonic reasoning without the restriction of stratification for predicates of arbitrary arity. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",0
"Decision-making is often dependent on uncertain data, e.g. data associated with confidence scores or probabilities. We present a comparison of different information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87% increase on average compared to graphical presentations).",1
"With a large proportion of people carrying location-aware smartphones, we have an unprecedented platform from which to understand individuals and predict their future actions. This work builds upon the Context Tree data structure that summarises the historical contexts of individuals from augmented geospatial trajectories, and constructs a predictive model for their likely future contexts. The Predictive Context Tree (PCT) is constructed as a hierarchical classifier, capable of predicting both the future locations that a user will visit and the contexts that a user will be immersed within. The PCT is evaluated over real-world geospatial trajectories, and compared against existing location extraction and prediction techniques, as well as a proposed hybrid approach that uses identified land usage elements in combination with machine learning to predict future interactions. Our results demonstrate that higher predictive accuracies can be achieved using this hybrid approach over traditional extracted location datasets, and the PCT itself matches the performance of the hybrid approach at predicting future interactions, while adding utility in the form of context predictions. Such a prediction system is capable of understanding not only where a user will visit, but also their context, in terms of what they are likely to be doing.",0
"We introduce the problem of Task Assignment and Sequencing (TAS), which adds the timeline perspective to expert crowdsourcing optimization. Expert crowdsourcing involves macrotasks, like document writing, product design, or web development, which take more time than typical binary microtasks, require expert skills, assume varying degrees of knowledge over a topic, and require crowd workers to build on each other's contributions. Current works usually assume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals known and do not take into account the element of time. Realistically however, time is critical: tasks have deadlines, expert workers are available only at specific time slots, and worker/task arrivals are not known a-priori. Our work is the first to address the problem of optimal task sequencing for online, heterogeneous, time-constrained macrotasks. We propose tas-online, an online algorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget, required quality and a given timeline, without future input information regarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Results, comparing tas-online to four typical benchmarks, show that it achieves more completed jobs, lower flow times and higher job quality. This work has practical implications for improving the Quality of Service of current crowdsourcing platforms, allowing them to offer cost, quality and time improvements for expert tasks.",0
"Numerous variants of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) have been proposed in the literature, including those which also possess an underlying structure, and in some cases, this structure itself can be defined by the user Although the concepts of growing the SOM and updating it have been studied, the whole issue of using a self-organizing Adaptive Data Structure (ADS) to further enhance the properties of the underlying SOM, has been unexplored. In an earlier work, we impose an arbitrary, user-defined, tree-like topology onto the codebooks, which consequently enforced a neighborhood phenomenon and the so-called tree-based Bubble of Activity. In this paper, we consider how the underlying tree itself can be rendered dynamic and adaptively transformed. To do this, we present methods by which a SOM with an underlying Binary Search Tree (BST) structure can be adaptively re-structured using Conditional Rotations (CONROT). These rotations on the nodes of the tree are local, can be done in constant time, and performed so as to decrease the Weighted Path Length (WPL) of the entire tree. In doing this, we introduce the pioneering concept referred to as Neural Promotion, where neurons gain prominence in the Neural Network (NN) as their significance increases. We are not aware of any research which deals with the issue of Neural Promotion. The advantages of such a scheme is that the user need not be aware of any of the topological peculiarities of the stochastic data distribution. Rather, the algorithm, referred to as the TTOSOM with Conditional Rotations (TTOCONROT), converges in such a manner that the neurons are ultimately placed in the input space so as to represent its stochastic distribution, and additionally, the neighborhood properties of the neurons suit the best BST that represents the data. These properties have been confirmed by our experimental results on a variety of data sets.",0
"In this paper, we evaluate convolutional neural network (CNN) features using the AlexNet architecture and very deep convolutional network (VGGNet) architecture. To date, most CNN researchers have employed the last layers before output, which were extracted from the fully connected feature layers. However, since it is unlikely that feature representation effectiveness is dependent on the problem, this study evaluates additional convolutional layers that are adjacent to fully connected layers, in addition to executing simple tuning for feature concatenation (e.g., layer 3 + layer 5 + layer 7) and transformation, using tools such as principal component analysis. In our experiments, we carried out detection and classification tasks using the Caltech 101 and Daimler Pedestrian Benchmark Datasets.",0
"Many real-world decision-theoretic planning problems can be naturally modeled with discrete and continuous state Markov decision processes (DC-MDPs). While previous work has addressed automated decision-theoretic planning for DCMDPs, optimal solutions have only been defined so far for limited settings, e.g., DC-MDPs having hyper-rectangular piecewise linear value functions. In this work, we extend symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) techniques to provide optimal solutions for a vastly expanded class of DCMDPs. To address the inherent combinatorial aspects of SDP, we introduce the XADD - a continuous variable extension of the algebraic decision diagram (ADD) - that maintains compact representations of the exact value function. Empirically, we demonstrate an implementation of SDP with XADDs on various DC-MDPs, showing the first optimal automated solutions to DCMDPs with linear and nonlinear piecewise partitioned value functions and showing the advantages of constraint-based pruning for XADDs.",0
"An algorithm running in O(1.1995n) is presented for counting models for exact satisfiability formulae(#XSAT). This is faster than the previously best algorithm which runs in O(1.2190n). In order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, a new principle, i.e. the common literals principle, is addressed to simplify formulae. This allows us to eliminate more common literals. In addition, we firstly inject the resolution principles into solving #XSAT problem, and therefore this further improves the efficiency of the algorithm.",0
"This study proposes a framework of Uncertainty-based Group Decision Support System (UGDSS). It provides a platform for multiple criteria decision analysis in six aspects including (1) decision environment, (2) decision problem, (3) decision group, (4) decision conflict, (5) decision schemes and (6) group negotiation. Based on multiple artificial intelligent technologies, this framework provides reliable support for the comprehensive manipulation of applications and advanced decision approaches through the design of an integrated multi-agents architecture.",0
"Constraint-based causal discovery from limited data is a notoriously difficult challenge due to the many borderline independence test decisions. Several approaches to improve the reliability of the predictions by exploiting redundancy in the independence information have been proposed recently. Though promising, existing approaches can still be greatly improved in terms of accuracy and scalability. We present a novel method that reduces the combinatorial explosion of the search space by using a more coarse-grained representation of causal information, drastically reducing computation time. Additionally, we propose a method to score causal predictions based on their confidence. Crucially, our implementation also allows one to easily combine observational and interventional data and to incorporate various types of available background knowledge. We prove soundness and asymptotic consistency of our method and demonstrate that it can outperform the state-of-the-art on synthetic data, achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We illustrate its practical feasibility by applying it on a challenging protein data set.",1
"In this work, we study the guaranteed delivery model which is widely used in online display advertising. In the guaranteed delivery scenario, ad exposures (which are also called impressions in some works) to users are guaranteed by contracts signed in advance between advertisers and publishers. A crucial problem for the advertising platform is how to fully utilize the valuable user traffic to generate as much as possible revenue.",1
"Lifted inference has been proposed for various probabilistic logical frameworks in order to compute the probability of queries in a time that is polynomial in the size of the domains of the logical variables rather than exponential. Even if various authors have underlined its importance for probabilistic logic programming (PLP), lifted inference has been applied up to now only to relational languages outside of logic programming. In this paper we adapt Generalized Counting First Order Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the problem of computing the probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs under the distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor Language (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for representing ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the existing causal independence relationships among some of the random variables and are managed by the extension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang and Poole for dealing with convergent variables and heterogeneous factors. Two new operators are added to GC-FOVE for treating heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called LP^2 for Lifted Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by modifying the PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for lifted inference. The comparison with PITA and ProbLog2 shows the potential of the approach. Note: To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",0
"In this paper we make a contribution to the unification of formal models of defeasible reasoning. We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions. More specifically, we translate adaptive logics into assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC+, ASPIC+ into assumption-based argumentation and a fragment of assumption-based argumentation into adaptive logics. Adaptive logics are closely related to Makinson's default assumptions and to a significant class of systems within the tradition of preferential semantics in the vein of KLM and Shoham. Thus, our results also provide close links between formal argumentation and the latter approaches.",0
"Kidney exchanges are organized markets where patients swap willing but incompatible donors. In the last decade, kidney exchanges grew from small and regional to large and national---and soon, international. This growth results in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors. State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary compatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encode real compatibility graphs. The experiments show that, indeed, small numbers of attributes suffice.",1
In this paper we analyze two recent axiomatic approaches proposed by Dubois et al and by Giang and Shenoy to qualitative decision making where uncertainty is described by possibility theory. Both axiomtizations are inspired by von Neumann and Morgenstern's system of axioms for the case of probability theory. We show that our approach naturally unifies two axiomatic systems that correspond respectively to pessimistic and optimistic decision criteria proposed by Dubois et al. The simplifying unification is achieved by (i) replacing axioms that are supposed to reflect two informational attitudes (uncertainty aversion and uncertainty attraction) by an axiom that imposes order on set of standard lotteries and (ii) using a binary utility scale in which each utility level is represented by a pair of numbers.,0
"Constraint Programming (CP) solvers typically tackle optimization problems by repeatedly finding solutions to a problem while placing tighter and tighter bounds on the solution cost. This approach is somewhat naive, especially for soft-constraint optimization problems in which the soft constraints are mostly satisfied. Unsatisfiable-core approaches to solving soft constraint problems in SAT (e.g. MAXSAT) force all soft constraints to be hard initially. When solving fails they return an unsatisfiable core, as a set of soft constraints that cannot hold simultaneously. These are reverted to soft and solving continues. Since lazy clause generation solvers can also return unsatisfiable cores we can adapt this approach to constraint programming. We adapt the original MAXSAT unsatisfiable core solving approach to be usable for constraint programming and define a number of extensions. Experimental results show that our methods are beneficial on a broad class of CP-optimization benchmarks involving soft constraints, cardinality or preferences.",0
"Predictive coding (PDC) has recently attracted attention in the neuroscience and computing community as a candidate unifying paradigm for neuronal studies and artificial neural network implementations particularly targeted at unsupervised learning systems. The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) has also recently been studied in relation to PC and found to be a useful ingredient in neural predictive coding systems. Backed by the behavior of living organisms, such networks are particularly useful in forming spatio-temporal transitions and invariant representations of the input world. However, most neural systems still do not account for large number of synapses even though this has been shown by a few machine learning researchers as an effective and very important component of any neural system if such a system is to behave properly. Our major point here is that PDC systems with the MMN effect in addition to a large number of synapses can greatly improve any neural learning system's performance and ability to make decisions in the machine world. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-mimetic computational intelligence algorithm -- the Deviant Learning Algorithm, inspired by these key ideas and functional properties of recent brain-cognitive discoveries and theories. We also show by numerical experiments guided by theoretical insights, how our invented bio-mimetic algorithm can achieve competitive predictions with even with very small problem specific data.",0
"We describe an inference task in which a set of timestamped event observations must be clustered into an unknown number of temporal sequences with independent and varying rates of observations. Various existing approaches to multi-object tracking assume a fixed number of sources and/or a fixed observation rate; we develop an approach to inferring structure in timestamped data produced by a mixture of an unknown and varying number of similar Markov renewal processes, plus independent clutter noise. The inference simultaneously distinguishes signal from noise as well as clustering signal observations into separate source streams. We illustrate the technique via a synthetic experiment as well as an experiment to track a mixture of singing birds.",0
"This paper studies the connection between probabilistic conditional independence in uncertain reasoning and data dependency in relational databases. As a demonstration of the usefulness of this preliminary investigation, an alternate proof is presented for refuting the conjecture suggested by Pearl and Paz that probabilistic conditional independencies have a complete axiomatization.",0
"When people converse about social or political topics, similar arguments are often paraphrased by different speakers, across many different conversations. Debate websites produce curated summaries of arguments on such topics; these summaries typically consist of lists of sentences that represent frequently paraphrased propositions, or labels capturing the essence of one particular aspect of an argument, e.g. Morality or Second Amendment. We call these frequently paraphrased propositions ARGUMENT FACETS. Like these curated sites, our goal is to induce and identify argument facets across multiple conversations, and produce summaries. However, we aim to do this automatically. We frame the problem as consisting of two steps: we first extract sentences that express an argument from raw social media dialogs, and then rank the extracted arguments in terms of their similarity to one another. Sets of similar arguments are used to represent argument facets. We show here that we can predict ARGUMENT FACET SIMILARITY with a correlation averaging 0.63 compared to a human topline averaging 0.68 over three debate topics, easily beating several reasonable baselines.",0
"Application programming interfaces (APIs) offer a plethora of functionalities for developers to reuse without reinventing the wheel. Identifying the appropriate APIs given a project requirement is critical for the success of a project, as many functionalities can be reused to achieve faster development. However, the massive number of APIs would often hinder the developers' ability to quickly find the right APIs. In this light, we propose a new, automated approach called WebAPIRec that takes as input a project profile and outputs a ranked list of {web} APIs that can be used to implement the project. At its heart, WebAPIRec employs a personalized ranking model that ranks web APIs specific (personalized) to a project. Based on the historical data of {web} API usages, WebAPIRec learns a model that minimizes the incorrect ordering of web APIs, i.e., when a used {web} API is ranked lower than an unused (or a not-yet-used) web API. We have evaluated our approach on a dataset comprising 9,883 web APIs and 4,315 web application projects from ProgrammableWeb with promising results. For 84.0% of the projects, WebAPIRec is able to successfully return correct APIs that are used to implement the projects in the top-5 positions. This is substantially better than the recommendations provided by ProgrammableWeb's native search functionality. WebAPIRec also outperforms McMillan et al.'s application search engine and popularity-based recommendation.",0
"Using an improved backtrack algorithm with sophisticated pruning techniques, we revise previous observations correlating a high frequency of hard to solve Hamiltonian Cycle instances with the Gn,m phase transition between Hamiltonicity and non-Hamiltonicity. Instead all tested graphs of 100 to 1500 vertices are easily solved. When we artificially restrict the degree sequence with a bounded maximum degree, although there is some increase in difficulty, the frequency of hard graphs is still low. When we consider more regular graphs based on a generalization of knight's tours, we observe frequent instances of really hard graphs, but on these the average degree is bounded by a constant. We design a set of graphs with a feature our algorithm is unable to detect and so are very hard for our algorithm, but in these we can vary the average degree from O(1) to O(n). We have so far found no class of graphs correlated with the Gn,m phase transition which asymptotically produces a high frequency of hard instances.",0
"In this paper we propose a causal analog to the purely observational Dynamic Bayesian Networks, which we call Dynamic Causal Networks. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for identification of Dynamic Causal Net- works, namely, for computing the effect of an intervention or experiment, based on passive observations only, whenever possible. We note the existence of two types of confounder variables that affect in substantially different ways the iden- tification procedures, a distinction with no analog in either Dynamic Bayesian Networks or standard causal graphs. We further propose a procedure for the transportability of causal effects in Dynamic Causal Network settings, where the re- sult of causal experiments in a source domain may be used for the identification of causal effects in a target domain.",0
"Given a set $V$ of $n$ elements and a distance matrix $[d_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ among elements, the max-mean dispersion problem (MaxMeanDP) consists in selecting a subset $M$ from $V$ such that the mean dispersion (or distance) among the selected elements is maximized. Being a useful model to formulate several relevant applications, MaxMeanDP is known to be NP-hard and thus computationally difficult. In this paper, we present a highly effective memetic algorithm for MaxMeanDP which relies on solution recombination and local optimization to find high quality solutions. Computational experiments on the set of 160 benchmark instances with up to 1000 elements commonly used in the literature show that the proposed algorithm improves or matches the published best known results for all instances in a short computing time, with only one exception, while achieving a high success rate of 100\%. In particular, we improve 59 previous best results out of the 60 most challenging instances. Results on a set of 40 new large instances with 3000 and 5000 elements are also presented. The key ingredients of the proposed algorithm are investigated to shed light on how they affect the performance of the algorithm.",0
"Linguistic relations in oral conversations present how opinions are constructed and developed in a restricted time. The relations bond ideas, arguments, thoughts, and feelings, re-shape them during a speech, and finally build knowledge out of all information provided in the conversation. Speakers share a common interest to discuss. It is expected that each speaker's reply includes duplicated forms of words from previous speakers. However, linguistic adaptation is observed and evolves in a more complex path than just transferring slightly modified versions of common concepts. A conversation aiming a benefit at the end shows an emergent cooperation inducing the adaptation. Not only cooperation, but also competition drives the adaptation or an opposite scenario and one can capture the dynamic process by tracking how the concepts are linguistically linked. To uncover salient complex dynamic events in verbal communications, we attempt to discover self-organized linguistic relations hidden in a conversation with explicitly stated winners and losers. We examine open access data of the United States Supreme Court. Our understanding is crucial in big data research to guide how transition states in opinion mining and decision-making should be modeled and how this required knowledge to guide the model should be pinpointed, by filtering large amount of data.",0
"Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) is one of the most played game genres nowadays. With the increasing growth of this genre, it becomes necessary to develop effective intelligent agents to play alongside or against human players. In this paper we address the problem of agent development for MOBA games. We implement a two-layered architecture agent that handles both navigation and game mechanics. This architecture relies on the use of Influence Maps, a widely used approach for tactical analysis. Several experiments were performed using {\em League of Legends} as a testbed, and show promising results in this highly dynamic real-time context.",0
"The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and its quantified extensions, whether without (QCSP) or with disjunction (QCSP_or), correspond naturally to the model checking problem for three increasingly stronger fragments of positive first-order logic. Their complexity is often studied when parameterised by a fixed model, the so-called template.",0
"A broad variety of knowledge-based applications such as recommender, expert, planning or configuration systems usually operate on the basis of knowledge represented by means of some logical language. Such a logical knowledge base (KB) enables intelligent behavior of such systems by allowing them to automatically reason, answer queries of interest or solve complex real-world problems. Nowadays, where information acquisition comes at low costs and often happens automatically, the applied KBs are continuously growing in terms of size, information content and complexity. These developments foster the emergence of errors in these KBs and thus pose a significant challenge on all people and tools involved in KB evolution, maintenance and application.",0
"CP-logic is a probabilistic extension of the logic FO(ID). Unlike ASP, both of these logics adhere to a Tarskian informal semantics, in which interpretations represent objective states-of-affairs. In other words, these logics lack the epistemic component of ASP, in which interpretations represent the beliefs or knowledge of a rational agent. Consequently, neither CP-logic nor FO(ID) have the need for two kinds of negations: there is only one negation, and its meaning is that of objective falsehood. Nevertheless, the formal semantics of this objective negation is mathematically more similar to ASP's negation-as-failure than to its classical negation. The reason is that both CP-logic and FO(ID) have a constructive semantics in which all atoms start out as false, and may only become true as the result of a rule application. This paper investigates the possibility of adding the well-known ASP feature of allowing negation in the head of rules to CP-logic. Because CP-logic only has one kind of negation, it is of necessity this ''negation-as-failure like'' negation that will be allowed in the head. We investigate the intuitive meaning of such a construct and the benefits that arise from it.",0
"In this paper, we take a statistical decision-theoretic viewpoint on social choice, putting a focus on the decision to be made on behalf of a system of agents. In our framework, we are given a statistical ranking model, a decision space, and a loss function defined on (parameter, decision) pairs, and formulate social choice mechanisms as decision rules that minimize expected loss. This suggests a general framework for the design and analysis of new social choice mechanisms. We compare Bayesian estimators, which minimize Bayesian expected loss, for the Mallows model and the Condorcet model respectively, and the Kemeny rule. We consider various normative properties, in addition to computational complexity and asymptotic behavior. In particular, we show that the Bayesian estimator for the Condorcet model satisfies some desired properties such as anonymity, neutrality, and monotonicity, can be computed in polynomial time, and is asymptotically different from the other two rules when the data are generated from the Condorcet model for some ground truth parameter.",1
"We present a method for solving implicit (factored) Markov decision processes (MDPs) with very large state spaces. We introduce a property of state space partitions which we call epsilon-homogeneity. Intuitively, an epsilon-homogeneous partition groups together states that behave approximately the same under all or some subset of policies. Borrowing from recent work on model minimization in computer-aided software verification, we present an algorithm that takes a factored representation of an MDP and an 0&lt;=epsilon&lt;=1 and computes a factored epsilon-homogeneous partition of the state space. This partition defines a family of related MDPs - those MDPs with state space equal to the blocks of the partition, and transition probabilities ""approximately"" like those of any (original MDP) state in the source block. To formally study such families of MDPs, we introduce the new notion of a ""bounded parameter MDP"" (BMDP), which is a family of (traditional) MDPs defined by specifying upper and lower bounds on the transition probabilities and rewards. We describe algorithms that operate on BMDPs to find policies that are approximately optimal with respect to the original MDP. In combination, our method for reducing a large implicit MDP to a possibly much smaller BMDP using an epsilon-homogeneous partition, and our methods for selecting actions in BMDPs constitute a new approach for analyzing large implicit MDPs. Among its advantages, this new approach provides insight into existing algorithms to solving implicit MDPs, provides useful connections to work in automata theory and model minimization, and suggests methods, which involve varying epsilon, to trade time and space (specifically in terms of the size of the corresponding state space) for solution quality.",0
"The fundamental issue in knowledge representation is to provide a precise definition of the knowledge that they possess in a manner that is independent of procedural considerations, context free and easy to manipulate, exchange and reason about. Knowledge must be accessible to everyone regardless of their native languages. Universal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language and a generalized form of human language in a machine independent digital platform for defining, recapitulating, amending, storing and dissipating knowledge among people of different affiliations. UNL extracts semantic data from a native language for Interlingua machine translation. This paper presents the development of a graphical tool that incorporates UNL to provide a visual mean to represent the semantic data available in a native text. UNL represents the semantics of a sentence as a conceptual hyper-graph. We translate this information into XML format and create a graph from XML, representing the actual concepts available in the native language",0
"In Bayesian networks, a Most Probable Explanation (MPE) is a complete variable instantiation with a highest probability given the current evidence. In this paper, we discuss the problem of finding robustness conditions of the MPE under single parameter changes. Specifically, we ask the question: How much change in a single network parameter can we afford to apply while keeping the MPE unchanged? We will describe a procedure, which is the first of its kind, that computes this answer for each parameter in the Bayesian network variable in time O(n exp(w)), where n is the number of network variables and w is its treewidth.",0
"Existing works for extracting navigation objects from webpages focus on navigation menus, so as to reveal the information architecture of the site. However, web 2.0 sites such as social networks, e-commerce portals etc. are making the understanding of the content structure in a web site increasingly difficult. Dynamic and personalized elements such as top stories, recommended list in a webpage are vital to the understanding of the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites. To better understand the content structure in web 2.0 sites, in this paper we propose a new extraction method for navigation objects in a webpage. Our method will extract not only the static navigation menus, but also the dynamic and personalized page-specific navigation lists. Since the navigation objects in a webpage naturally come in blocks, we first cluster hyperlinks into different blocks by exploiting spatial locations of hyperlinks, the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree and the hyperlink density. Then we identify navigation objects from those blocks using the SVM classifier with novel features such as anchor text lengths etc. Experiments on real-world data sets with webpages from various domains and styles verified the effectiveness of our method.",0
"The ability of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to find a global optimal solution depends on its capacity to find a good rate between exploitation of found so far elements and exploration of the search space. Inspired by natural phenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms which, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves complex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration/exploitation balance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of Matter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation of the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which interact to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the physical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is devised by considering each state of matter at one different exploration/exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three phases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each state, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning from the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities of exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is reached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance between exploration/exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities of an evolutionary approach.",0
"Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms exploit regularities in the structure of graphical models to perform inference more efficiently. More specifically, they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once per group, as opposed to once per variable. The groups are defined by means of constraints, so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity of the constraint language. Existing approaches for exact lifted inference use specific languages for (in)equality constraints, which often have limited expressivity. In this article, we decouple lifted inference from the constraint language. We define operators for lifted inference in terms of relational algebra operators, so that they operate on the semantic level (the constraints extension) rather than on the syntactic level, making them language-independent. As a result, lifted inference can be performed using more powerful constraint languages, which provide more opportunities for lifting. We empirically demonstrate that this can improve inference efficiency by orders of magnitude, allowing exact inference where until now only approximate inference was feasible.",0
"Prof. Robert Berwick's abstract for his forthcoming invited talk at the ACL2016 workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning revives an ancient debate. Entitled ""Why take a chance?"", Berwick seems to refer implicitly to Chomsky's critique of the statistical approach of Harris as well as the currently dominant paradigms in CoNLL.",0
"This paper considers the problem of knowledge-based model construction in the presence of uncertainty about the association of domain entities to random variables. Multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBNs) are defined as a representation for knowledge in domains characterized by uncertainty in the number of relevant entities, their interrelationships, and their association with observables. An MEBN implicitly specifies a probability distribution in terms of a hierarchically structured collection of Bayesian network fragments that together encode a joint probability distribution over arbitrarily many interrelated hypotheses. Although a finite query-complete model can always be constructed, association uncertainty typically makes exact model construction and evaluation intractable. The objective of hypothesis management is to balance tractability against accuracy. We describe an application to the problem of using intelligence reports to infer the organization and activities of groups of military vehicles. Our approach is compared to related work in the tracking and fusion literature.",0
"Machine learning enables systems to build and update domain models based on runtime observations. In this paper, we study statistical model checking and runtime verification for systems with this ability. Two challenges arise: (1) Models built from limited runtime data yield uncertainty to be dealt with. (2) There is no definition of satisfaction w.r.t. uncertain hypotheses. We propose such a definition of subjective satisfaction based on recently introduced satisfaction functions. We also propose the BV algorithm as a Bayesian solution to runtime verification of subjective satisfaction under model uncertainty. BV provides user-definable stochastic bounds for type I and II errors. We discuss empirical results from an example application to illustrate our ideas.",0
"This paper presents a knowledge-based detection of objects approach using the OWL ontology language, the Semantic Web Rule Language, and 3D processing built-ins aiming at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and specialist's knowledge. This combination allows the detection and the annotation of objects contained in point clouds. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS systems or an IFC file for architecture purposes.",0
"A computer Program Capable of performing at a human-expert level in a narrow problem domain area is called an expert system. Management of uncertainty is an intrinsically important issue in the design of expert systems because much of the information in the knowledge base of a typical expert system is imprecise, incomplete or not totally reliable. In this paper, the author present s the review of past work that has been carried out by various researchers based on development of expert systems for the diagnosis of cardiac disease",0

"We describe Dr.Fill, a program that solves American-style crossword puzzles. From a technical perspective, Dr.Fill works by converting crosswords to weighted CSPs, and then using a variety of novel techniques to find a solution. These techniques include generally applicable heuristics for variable and value selection, a variant of limited discrepancy search, and postprocessing and partitioning ideas. Branch and bound is not used, as it was incompatible with postprocessing and was determined experimentally to be of little practical value. Dr.Fillls performance on crosswords from the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament suggests that it ranks among the top fifty or so crossword solvers in the world.",0
"Botnets, which consist of thousands of compromised machines, can cause significant threats to other systems by launching Distributed Denial of Service (SSoS) attacks, keylogging, and backdoors. In response to these threats, new effective techniques are needed to detect the presence of botnets. In this paper, we have used an interception technique to monitor Windows Application Programming Interface (API) functions calls made by communication applications and store these calls with their arguments in log files. Our algorithm detects botnets based on monitoring abnormal activity by correlating the changes in log file sizes from different hosts.",0
"We introduce stratified labelings as a novel semantical approach to abstract argumentation frameworks. Compared to standard labelings, stratified labelings provide a more fine-grained assessment of the controversiality of arguments using ranks instead of the usual labels in, out, and undecided. We relate the framework of stratified labelings to conditional logic and, in particular, to the System Z ranking functions.",0
"With the rapid growth of social media, rumors are also spreading widely on social media and bring harm to people's daily life. Nowadays, information credibility evaluation has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities. Current methods mainly focus on feature engineering and achieve some success. However, feature engineering based methods require a lot of labor and cannot fully reveal the underlying relations among data. In our viewpoint, the key elements of user behaviors for evaluating credibility are concluded as ""who"", ""what"", ""when"", and ""how"". These existing methods cannot model the correlation among different key elements during the spreading of microblogs. In this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Information Credibility Evaluation (ICE), to learn representations of information credibility on social media. In ICE, latent representations are learnt for modeling user credibility, behavior types, temporal properties, and comment attitudes. The aggregation of these factors in the microblog spreading process yields the representation of a user's behavior, and the aggregation of these dynamic representations generates the credibility representation of an event spreading on social media. Moreover, a pairwise learning method is applied to maximize the credibility difference between rumors and non-rumors. To evaluate the performance of ICE, we conduct experiments on a Sina Weibo data set, and the experimental results show that our ICE model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",0
"This paper discusses a fuzzy model for multi-level human emotions recognition by computer systems through keyboard keystrokes, mouse and touchscreen interactions. This model can also be used to detect the other possible emotions at the time of recognition. Accuracy measurements of human emotions by the fuzzy model are discussed through two methods; the first is accuracy analysis and the second is false positive rate analysis. This fuzzy model detects more emotions, but on the other hand, for some of emotions, a lower accuracy was obtained with the comparison with the non-fuzzy human emotions detection methods. This system was trained and tested by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to recognize the users' emotions. Overall, this model represents a closer similarity between human brain detection of emotions and computer systems.",0
"The paper introduces AND/OR importance sampling for probabilistic graphical models. In contrast to importance sampling, AND/OR importance sampling caches samples in the AND/OR space and then extracts a new sample mean from the stored samples. We prove that AND/OR importance sampling may have lower variance than importance sampling; thereby providing a theoretical justification for preferring it over importance sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that AND/OR importance sampling is far more accurate than importance sampling in many cases.",0
"Planning is concerned with the automated solution of action sequencing problems described in declarative languages giving the action preconditions and effects. One important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in Business Process Management (BPM), which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment. A major obstacle for the application of Planning in this area lies in the modeling. Obtaining a suitable model to plan with -- ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language -- is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly. Our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with model-based software development. Our application at SAP, one of the leading vendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use is possible.",0
"We present PEC, an Event Calculus (EC) style action language for reasoning about probabilistic causal and narrative information. It has an action language style syntax similar to that of the EC variant Modular-E. Its semantics is given in terms of possible worlds which constitute possible evolutions of the domain, and builds on that of EFEC, an epistemic extension of EC. We also describe an ASP implementation of PEC and show the sense in which this is sound and complete.",0
"Retention of residual skills for persons who partially lose their cognitive or physical ability is of utmost importance. Research is focused on developing systems that provide need-based assistance for retention of such residual skills. This paper describes a novel cognitive collaborative control architecture C3A, designed to address the challenges of developing need- based assistance for wheelchair navigation. Organization of C3A is detailed and results from simulation of the proposed architecture is presented. For simulation of our proposed architecture, we have used ROS (Robot Operating System) as a control framework and a 3D robotic simulator called USARSim (Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation).",0
"Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning is a formally elegant approach to learning optimal behaviour under model uncertainty. In this setting, a Bayes-optimal policy captures the ideal trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Unfortunately, finding Bayes-optimal policies is notoriously taxing due to the enormous search space in the augmented belief-state MDP. In this paper we exploit recent advances in sample-based planning, based on Monte-Carlo tree search, to introduce a tractable method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning. Unlike prior work in this area, we avoid expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree, by lazily sampling models from the current beliefs. Our approach outperformed prior Bayesian model-based RL algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems.",1
"We introduce GuessWhat?!, a two-player guessing game as a testbed for research on the interplay of computer vision and dialogue systems. The goal of the game is to locate an unknown object in a rich image scene by asking a sequence of questions. Higher-level image understanding, like spatial reasoning and language grounding, is required to solve the proposed task. Our key contribution is the collection of a large-scale dataset consisting of 150K human-played games with a total of 800K visual question-answer pairs on 66K images. We explain our design decisions in collecting the dataset and introduce the oracle and questioner tasks that are associated with the two players of the game. We prototyped deep learning models to establish initial baselines of the introduced tasks.",0
"There are two common approaches for optimizing the performance of a machine: genetic algorithms and machine learning. A genetic algorithm is applied over many generations whereas machine learning works by applying feedback until the system meets a performance threshold. Though these are methods that typically operate separately, we combine evolutionary adaptation and machine learning into one approach. Our focus is on machines that can learn during their lifetime, but instead of equipping them with a machine learning algorithm we aim to let them evolve their ability to learn by themselves. We use evolvable networks of probabilistic and deterministic logic gates, known as Markov Brains, as our computational model organism. The ability of Markov Brains to learn is augmented by a novel adaptive component that can change its computational behavior based on feedback. We show that Markov Brains can indeed evolve to incorporate these feedback gates to improve their adaptability to variable environments. By combining these two methods, we now also implemented a computational model that can be used to study the evolution of learning.",0
"We present a transition-based parser that jointly produces syntactic and semantic dependencies. It learns a representation of the entire algorithm state, using stack long short-term memories.

On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that jointly learn syntax and semantics.",0
"The human intelligence lies in the algorithm, the nature of algorithms lies in the classification, and the classification is equal to outlier detection. This paper is based on its past unpublished edition (2009), which discussed an application of (pe) algorithm in outlier detection for time series data. The pe algorithm, also named as RDD algorithm, is originated from the study on general AI. United with it, designed modules can be used to realize kinds of tasks. A primary framework concerned with the mind through pe algorithm has been constructed in prior works. In this concise paper, we neglect background and minor description of the early edition, and directly discuss the main contents include longest k-turn subsequence problem, curve type outliers, futural directions and related comments.",0
"This article presents an agent architecture for controlling an autonomous agent in stochastic environments. The architecture combines the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model with the belief-desire-intention (BDI) framework. The Hybrid POMDP-BDI agent architecture takes the best features from the two approaches, that is, the online generation of reward-maximizing courses of action from POMDP theory, and sophisticated multiple goal management from BDI theory. We introduce the advances made since the introduction of the basic architecture, including (i) the ability to pursue multiple goals simultaneously and (ii) a plan library for storing pre-written plans and for storing recently generated plans for future reuse. A version of the architecture without the plan library is implemented and is evaluated using simulations. The results of the simulation experiments indicate that the approach is feasible.",0
"In this paper, we introduce evidence propagation operations on influence diagrams and a concept of value of evidence, which measures the value of experimentation. Evidence propagation operations are critical for the computation of the value of evidence, general update and inference operations in normative expert systems which are based on the influence diagram (generalized Bayesian network) paradigm. The value of evidence allows us to compute directly an outcome sensitivity, a value of perfect information and a value of control which are used in decision analysis (the science of decision making under uncertainty). More specifically, the outcome sensitivity is the maximum difference among the values of evidence, the value of perfect information is the expected value of the values of evidence, and the value of control is the optimal value of the values of evidence. We also discuss an implementation and a relative computational efficiency issues related to the value of evidence and the value of perfect information.",0
"The Internet of Things is arriving to our homes or cities through fields already known like Smart Homes, Smart Cities, or Smart Towns. The monitoring of environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the indoor locations of the cities in order to be more comfortable for people who stay there. A way to improve the indoor conditions is an efficient temperature control, however, it depends on many factors like the different combinations of outdoor temperature and humidity. Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions and we need a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret many states, more than two states, giving to computers the capacity to react in a similar way to people. In this paper we will propose a new approach to control the temperature using the Internet of Things together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding not only the indoor temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity in order to save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their users. Finally, we will conclude that the fuzzy approach allows us to achieve an energy saving around 40% and thus, save money.",0
"As penetration testing frameworks have evolved and have become more complex, the problem of controlling automatically the pentesting tool has become an important question. This can be naturally addressed as an attack planning problem. Previous approaches to this problem were based on modeling the actions and assets in the PDDL language, and using off-the-shelf AI tools to generate attack plans. These approaches however are limited. In particular, the planning is classical (the actions are deterministic) and thus not able to handle the uncertainty involved in this form of attack planning.",0
"We consider an orienteering problem (OP) where an agent needs to visit a series (possibly a subset) of depots, from which the maximal accumulated profits are desired within given limited time budget. Different from most existing works where the profits are assumed to be static, in this work we investigate a variant that has time-dependent profits. Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e.g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is essentially NP-hard. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions.",0
"Prior to seeking professional medical care it is increasingly common for patients to use online resources such as automated symptom checkers. Many such systems attempt to provide a differential diagnosis based on the symptoms elucidated from the user, which may lead to anxiety if life or limb-threatening conditions are part of the list, a phenomenon termed 'cyberchondria' [1]. Systems that provide advice on where to seek help, rather than a diagnosis, are equally popular, and in our view provide the most useful information. In this technical report we describe how such a triage system can be modelled computationally, how medical insights can be translated into triage flows, and how such systems can be validated and tested. We present babylon check, our commercially deployed automated triage system, as a case study, and illustrate its performance in a large, semi-naturalistic deployment study.",0
"In this paper we discuss methods of using the language of actions, formal languages, and grammars for qualitative conceptual linguistic modeling of companies as technological and human institutions. The main problem following the discussion is the problem to find and describe a language structure for external and internal flow of information of companies. We anticipate that the language structure of external and internal base flows determine the structure of companies. In the structure modeling of an abstract industrial company an internal base flow of information is constructed as certain flow of words composed on the theoretical parts-processes-actions language. The language of procedures is found for an external base flow of information for an insurance company. The formal stochastic grammar for the language of procedures is found by statistical methods and is used in understanding the tendencies of the health care industry. We present the model of human communications as a random walk on the semantic tree",0
"Agent technology is a software paradigm that permits to implement large and complex distributed applications. In order to assist analyzing, conception and development or implementation phases of multi-agent systems, we've tried to present a practical application of a generic and scalable method of a MAS with a component-oriented architecture and agent-based approach that allows MDA to generate source code from a given model. We've designed on AUML the class diagrams as a class meta-model of different agents of a MAS. Then we generated the source code of the models developed using an open source tool called AndroMDA. This agent-based and evolutive approach enhances the modularity and genericity developments and promotes their reusability in future developments. This property distinguishes our design methodology of existing methodologies in that it is constrained by any particular agent-based model while providing a library of generic models",0
"We introduce a new approach to solving path-finding problems under uncertainty by representing them as probabilistic models and applying domain-independent inference algorithms to the models. This approach separates problem representation from the inference algorithm and provides a framework for efficient learning of path-finding policies. We evaluate the new approach on the Canadian Traveler Problem, which we formulate as a probabilistic model, and show how probabilistic inference allows high performance stochastic policies to be obtained for this problem.",0
"We address the problem of belief change in (nonmonotonic) logic programming under answer set semantics. Unlike previous approaches to belief change in logic programming, our formal techniques are analogous to those of distance-based belief revision in propositional logic. In developing our results, we build upon the model theory of logic programs furnished by SE models. Since SE models provide a formal, monotonic characterisation of logic programs, we can adapt techniques from the area of belief revision to belief change in logic programs. We introduce methods for revising and merging logic programs, respectively. For the former, we study both subset-based revision as well as cardinality-based revision, and we show that they satisfy the majority of the AGM postulates for revision. For merging, we consider operators following arbitration merging and IC merging, respectively. We also present encodings for computing the revision as well as the merging of logic programs within the same logic programming framework, giving rise to a direct implementation of our approach in terms of off-the-shelf answer set solvers. These encodings reflect in turn the fact that our change operators do not increase the complexity of the base formalism.",0
"In this paper we introduce a new method called \alpha-Discounting Multi-Criteria Decision Making (\alpha-D MCDM), which is an aletrnative and extension of Saaty's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). It works for any set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. \alpha-D MCDM is then generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or non-linear equations and/or inequalities. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples are given.",0
"Imbalance (on-line energy gap between contracted supply and actual demand, and associated cost) reduction is going to be a crucial service for a Power Producer and Supplier (PPS) in the deregulated energy market. PPS requires forward market interactions to procure energy as precisely as possible in order to reduce imbalance energy. This paper presents, 1) (off-line) an effective demand aggregation based strategy for creating a number of balancing groups that leads to higher predictability of group-wise aggregated demand, 2) (on-line) a robust energy storage scheduling that minimizes the imbalance for a particular balancing group considering the demand prediction uncertainty. The group formation is performed by a Probabilistic Programming approach using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method after applied on the historical demand statistics. Apart from the group formation, the aggregation strategy (with the help of Bayesian Inference) also clears out the upper-limit of the required storage capacity for a formed group, fraction of which is to be utilized in on-line operation. For on-line operation, a robust energy storage scheduling method is proposed that minimizes expected imbalance energy and cost (a non-linear function of imbalance energy) while incorporating the demand uncertainty of a particular group. The proposed methods are applied on the real apartment buildings' demand data in Tokyo, Japan. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",0
"In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of graph-based service composition in terms of its dependency with service discovery. Driven by this analysis we define a composition framework by means of integration with fine-grained I/O service discovery that enables the generation of a graph-based composition which contains the set of services that are semantically relevant for an input-output request. The proposed framework also includes an optimal composition search algorithm to extract the best composition from the graph minimising the length and the number of services, and different graph optimisations to improve the scalability of the system. A practical implementation used for the empirical analysis is also provided. This analysis proves the scalability and flexibility of our proposal and provides insights on how integrated composition systems can be designed in order to achieve good performance in real scenarios for the Web.",0
"This study suggests a new prediction model for chaotic time series inspired by the brain emotional learning of mammals. We describe the structure and function of this model, which is referred to as BELPM (Brain Emotional Learning-Based Prediction Model). Structurally, the model mimics the connection between the regions of the limbic system, and functionally it uses weighted k nearest neighbors to imitate the roles of those regions. The learning algorithm of BELPM is defined using steepest descent (SD) and the least square estimator (LSE). Two benchmark chaotic time series, Lorenz and Henon, have been used to evaluate the performance of BELPM. The obtained results have been compared with those of other prediction methods. The results show that BELPM has the capability to achieve a reasonable accuracy for long-term prediction of chaotic time series, using a limited amount of training data and a reasonably low computational time.",0
"This is a nontechnical phenomenological proof that pattern-recognition and consciousness are the same activity, with some speculation about the importance of this. Since Husserl, many philosophers have accepted that consciousness consists of a stream of logical connections between an ego and external objects. These connections are called ""intentions."" Pattern recognition systems are achievable technical artifacts. The proof links a respected philosophical theory of consciousness with technical art, and may therefore enable a theoretically-grounded form of artificial intelligence called a ""synthetic intentionality,"" a being able to synthesize, generalize, select and repeat a stream of intentions. If the pattern recognition is reflexive, able to operate on the stream of intentions, and flexible, able to find new types of connections, perhaps by evolutionary programming, an SI may be a particularly strong form of AI. The article then addresses some conventional problems: Searles' Chinese room, and how an SI could ""understand"" ""meanings"" and ""be creative.""",0
"People enjoy encounters with generative software, but rarely are they encouraged to interact with, understand or engage with it. In this paper we define the term 'PCG-based game', and explain how this concept follows on from the idea of an AI-based game. We look at existing examples of games which foreground their AI, put forward a methodology for designing PCG-based games, describe some example case study designs for PCG-based games, and describe lessons learned during this process of sketching and developing ideas.",0
"Identifying and controlling bias is a key problem in empirical sciences. Causal diagram theory provides graphical criteria for deciding whether and how causal effects can be identified from observed (nonexperimental) data by covariate adjustment. Here we prove equivalences between existing as well as new criteria for adjustment and we provide a new simplified but still equivalent notion of d-separation. These lead to efficient algorithms for two important tasks in causal diagram analysis: (1) listing minimal covariate adjustments (with polynomial delay); and (2) identifying the subdiagram involved in biasing paths (in linear time). Our results improve upon existing exponential-time solutions for these problems, enabling users to assess the effects of covariate adjustment on diagrams with tens to hundreds of variables interactively in real time.",0
"An active object recognition system has the advantage of being able to act in the environment to capture images that are more suited for training and that lead to better performance at test time. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network for active object recognition that simultaneously predicts the object label, and selects the next action to perform on the object with the aim of improving recognition performance. We treat active object recognition as a reinforcement learning problem and derive the cost function to train the network for joint prediction of the object label and the action. A generative model of object similarities based on the Dirichlet distribution is proposed and embedded in the network for encoding the state of the system. The training is carried out by simultaneously minimizing the label and action prediction errors using gradient descent. We empirically show that the proposed network is able to predict both the object label and the actions on GERMS, a dataset for active object recognition. We compare the test label prediction accuracy of the proposed model with Dirichlet and Naive Bayes state encoding. The results of experiments suggest that the proposed model equipped with Dirichlet state encoding is superior in performance, and selects images that lead to better training and higher accuracy of label prediction at test time.",0
"Deliberation plays an important role in the design of rational agents embedded in the real-world. In particular, deliberation leads to the formation of intentions, i.e., plans of action that the agent is committed to achieving. In this paper, we present a branching time possible-worlds model for representing and reasoning about, beliefs, goals, intentions, time, actions, probabilities, and payoffs. We compare this possible-worlds approach with the more traditional decision tree representation and provide a transformation from decision trees to possible worlds. Finally, we illustrate how an agent can perform deliberation using a decision-tree representation and then use a possible-worlds model to form and reason about his intentions.",0
We present a technique for speeding up the convergence of value iteration for partially observable Markov decisions processes (POMDPs). The underlying idea is similar to that behind modified policy iteration for fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs). The technique can be easily incorporated into any existing POMDP value iteration algorithms. Experiments have been conducted on several test problems with one POMDP value iteration algorithm called incremental pruning. We find that the technique can make incremental pruning run several orders of magnitude faster.,0

The skeletal animation approach is adapted to make use of a deformable rig controlled by tongue motion capture data obtained with electromagnetic articulography (EMA), while the tongue surface is extracted from volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Initial results are shown and future work outlined.",0
"The holistic approach to sustainable urban planning implies using different models in an integrated way that is capable of simulating the urban system. As the interconnection of such models is not a trivial task, one of the key elements that may be applied is the description of the urban geometric properties in an ""interoperable"" way. Focusing on air quality as one of the most pronounced urban problems, the geometric aspects of a city may be described by objects such as those defined in CityGML, so that an appropriate air quality model can be applied for estimating the quality of the urban air on the basis of atmospheric flow and chemistry equations.",0
"Answering open-ended questions is an essential capability for any intelligent agent. One of the most interesting recent open-ended question answering challenges is Visual Question Answering (VQA) which attempts to evaluate a system's visual understanding through its answers to natural language questions about images. There exist many approaches to VQA, the majority of which do not exhibit deeper semantic understanding of the candidate answers they produce. We study the importance of generating plausible answers to a given question by introducing the novel task of `Answer Proposal': for a given open-ended question, a system should generate a ranked list of candidate answers informed by the semantics of the question. We experiment with various models including a neural generative model as well as a semantic graph matching one. We provide both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for the task of Answer Proposal, showing that our best model learns to propose plausible answers with a high recall and performs competitively with some other solutions to VQA.",0
"The task of artificial intelligence is to provide representation techniques for describing problems, as well as search algorithms that can be used to answer our questions. A widespread and elaborated model is state-space representation, which, however, has some shortcomings. Classical search algorithms are not applicable in practice when the state space contains even only a few tens of thousands of states. We can give remedy to this problem by defining some kind of heuristic knowledge. In case of classical state-space representation, heuristic must be defined so that it qualifies an arbitrary state based on its ""goodness,"" which is obviously not trivial. In our paper, we introduce an algorithm that gives us the ability to handle huge state spaces and to use a heuristic concept which is easier to embed into search algorithms.",0
"Bayesian Networks (BN) provide robust probabilistic methods of reasoning under uncertainty, but despite their formal grounds are strictly based on the notion of conditional dependence, not much attention has been paid so far to their use in dependability analysis. The aim of this paper is to propose BN as a suitable tool for dependability analysis, by challenging the formalism with basic issues arising in dependability tasks. We will discuss how both modeling and analysis issues can be naturally dealt with by BN. Moreover, we will show how some limitations intrinsic to combinatorial dependability methods such as Fault Trees can be overcome using BN. This will be pursued through the study of a real-world example concerning the reliability analysis of a redundant digital Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with majority voting 2:3",0
We propose an original particle-based implementation of the Loopy Belief Propagation (LPB) algorithm for pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF) on a continuous state space. The algorithm constructs adaptively efficient proposal distributions approximating the local beliefs at each note of the MRF. This is achieved by considering proposal distributions in the exponential family whose parameters are updated iterately in an Expectation Propagation (EP) framework. The proposed particle scheme provides consistent estimation of the LBP marginals as the number of particles increases. We demonstrate that it provides more accurate results than the Particle Belief Propagation (PBP) algorithm of Ihler and McAllester (2009) at a fraction of the computational cost and is additionally more robust empirically. The computational complexity of our algorithm at each iteration is quadratic in the number of particles. We also propose an accelerated implementation with sub-quadratic computational complexity which still provides consistent estimates of the loopy BP marginal distributions and performs almost as well as the original procedure.,1

"Approximate Bayesian inference is NP-hard. Dagum and Luby defined the Local Variance Bound (LVB) to measure the approximation hardness of Bayesian inference on Bayesian networks, assuming the networks model strictly positive joint probability distributions, i.e. zero probabilities are not permitted. This paper introduces the k-test to measure the approximation hardness of inference on Bayesian networks with deterministic causalities in the probability distribution, i.e. when zero conditional probabilities are permitted. Approximation by stochastic sampling is a widely-used inference method that is known to suffer from inefficiencies due to sample rejection. The k-test predicts when rejection rates of stochastic sampling a Bayesian network will be low, modest, high, or when sampling is intractable.",0

Exper- imental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory performance for categorizing videos based on skin color.",0

"It is hypothesized that creativity arises from the self-mending capacity of an internal model of the world, or worldview. The uniquely honed worldview of a creative individual results in a distinctive style that is recognizable within and across domains. It is further hypothesized that creativity is domaingeneral in the sense that there exist multiple avenues by which the distinctiveness of one's worldview can be expressed. These hypotheses were tested using art students and creative writing students. Art students guessed significantly above chance both which painting was done by which of five famous artists, and which artwork was done by which of their peers. Similarly, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance both which passage was written by which of five famous writers, and which passage was written by which of their peers. These findings support the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable. Moreover, creative writing students guessed significantly above chance which of their peers produced particular works of art, supporting the hypothesis that creative style is recognizable not just within but across domains.",0
"Relational Markov Decision Processes are a useful abstraction for complex reinforcement learning problems and stochastic planning problems. Recent work developed representation schemes and algorithms for planning in such problems using the value iteration algorithm. However, exact versions of more complex algorithms, including policy iteration, have not been developed or analyzed. The paper investigates this potential and makes several contributions. First we observe two anomalies for relational representations showing that the value of some policies is not well defined or cannot be calculated for restricted representation schemes used in the literature. On the other hand, we develop a variant of policy iteration that can get around these anomalies. The algorithm includes an aspect of policy improvement in the process of policy evaluation and thus differs from the original algorithm. We show that despite this difference the algorithm converges to the optimal policy.",0
"In many combinatorial problems one may need to model the diversity or similarity of assignments in a solution. For example, one may wish to maximise or minimise the number of distinct values in a solution. To formulate problems of this type, we can use soft variants of the well known AllDifferent and AllEqual constraints. We present a taxonomy of six soft global constraints, generated by combining the two latter ones and the two standard cost functions, which are either maximised or minimised. We characterise the complexity of achieving arc and bounds consistency on these constraints, resolving those cases for which NP-hardness was neither proven nor disproven. In particular, we explore in depth the constraint ensuring that at least k pairs of variables have a common value. We show that achieving arc consistency is NP-hard, however achieving bounds consistency can be done in polynomial time through dynamic programming. Moreover, we show that the maximum number of pairs of equal variables can be approximated by a factor 1/2 with a linear time greedy algorithm. Finally, we provide a fixed parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of values appearing in more than two distinct domains. Interestingly, this taxonomy shows that enforcing equality is harder than enforcing difference.",0
"A major limitation of exact inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models is their extensive memory usage, which often puts real-world problems out of their reach. In this paper we show how we can extend inference algorithms, particularly Bucket Elimination, a special case of cluster (join) tree decomposition, to utilize disk memory. We provide the underlying ideas and show promising empirical results of exactly solving large problems not solvable before.",0
"We introduce the concept of continuous transportation task to the context of multi-agent systems. A continuous transportation task is one in which a multi-agent team visits a number of fixed locations, picks up objects, and delivers them to a final destination. The goal is to maximize the rate of transportation while the objects are replenished over time. Examples of problems that need continuous transportation are foraging, area sweeping, and first/last mile problem. Previous approaches typically neglect the interference and are highly dependent on communications among agents. Some also incorporate an additional reconnaissance agent to gather information. In this paper, we present a hybrid of centralized and distributed approaches that minimize the interference and communications in the multi-agent team without the need for a reconnaissance agent. We contribute two partitioning-transportation algorithms inspired by existing algorithms, and contribute one novel online partitioning-transportation algorithm with information gathering in the multi-agent team. Our algorithms have been implemented and tested extensively in the simulation. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms that outperform the existing algorithms, even without any communications between the agents and without the presence of a reconnaissance agent.",0
"Sample complexity and safety are major challenges when learning policies with reinforcement learning for real-world tasks -- especially when the policies are represented using rich function approximators like deep neural networks. Model-based methods where the real-world target domain is approximated using a simulated source domain provide an avenue to tackle the above challenges by augmenting real data with simulated data. However, discrepancies between the simulated source domain and the target domain pose a challenge for simulated training. We introduce the EPOpt algorithm, which uses an ensemble of simulated source domains and a form of adversarial training to learn policies that are robust and generalize to a broad range of possible target domains, including to unmodeled effects. Further, the probability distribution over source domains in the ensemble can be adapted using data from target domain and approximate Bayesian methods, to progressively make it a better approximation. Thus, learning on a model ensemble, along with source domain adaptation, provides the benefit of both robustness and learning/adaptation.",1
"The Web has made it possible to harness human cognition en masse to achieve new capabilities. Some of these successes are well known; for example Wikipedia has become the go-to place for basic information on all things; Duolingo engages millions of people in real-life translation of text, while simultaneously teaching them to speak foreign languages; and fold.it has enabled public-driven scientific discoveries by recasting complex biomedical challenges into popular online puzzle games. These and other early successes hint at the tremendous potential for future crowd-powered capabilities for the benefit of health, education, science, and society. In the process, a new field called Human Computation has emerged to better understand, replicate, and improve upon these successes through scientific research. Human Computation refers to the science that underlies online crowd-powered systems and was the topic of a recent visioning activity in which a representative cross-section of researchers, industry practitioners, visionaries, funding agency representatives, and policy makers came together to understand what makes crowd-powered systems successful. Teams of experts considered past, present, and future human computation systems to explore which kinds of crowd-powered systems have the greatest potential for societal impact and which kinds of research will best enable the efficient development of new crowd-powered systems to achieve this impact. This report summarize the products and findings of those activities as well as the unconventional process and activities employed by the workshop, which were informed by human computation research.",0
"Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

"In this paper, we propose ELF, an Extensive, Lightweight and Flexible platform for fundamental reinforcement learning research. Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-per-second (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like Arcade Learning Environment. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than $70\%$ of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies. ELF, along with its RL platform, will be open-sourced.",1

As a consequence of our work, we release presumably the largest and the most accurate multilingual taxonomic resource spanning over 280 languages.",0

"Objects or structures that are regular take uniform dimensions. Based on the concepts of regular models, our previous research work has developed a system of a regular ontology that models learning structures in a multiagent system for uniform pre-assessments in a learning environment. This regular ontology has led to the modelling of a classified rules learning algorithm that predicts the actual number of rules needed for inductive learning processes and decision making in a multiagent system. But not all processes or models are regular. Thus this paper presents a system of polynomial equation that can estimate and predict the required number of rules of a non-regular ontology model given some defined parameters.",0
"Once known to be used exclusively in military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) have stepped up to become a part of new logistic method in commercial sector called ""last-mile delivery"". In this novel approach, small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), also known as drones, are deployed alongside with trucks to deliver goods to customers in order to improve the service quality or reduce the transportation cost. It gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), of which we call TSP with drone (TSP-D). In this article, we consider a variant of TSP-D where the main objective is to minimize the total transportation cost. We also propose two heuristics: ""Drone First, Truck Second"" (DFTS) and ""Truck First, Drone Second"" (TFDS), to effectively solve the problem. The former constructs route for drone first while the latter constructs route for truck first. We solve a TSP to generate route for truck and propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation with different profit functions to build route for drone. Numerical results obtained on many instances with different sizes and characteristics are presented. Recommendations on promising algorithm choices are also provided.",0
"We present the first reinforcement-learning model to self-improve its reward-modulated training implemented through a continuously improving ""intuition"" neural network. An agent was trained how to play the arcade video game Pong with two reward-based alternatives, one where the paddle was placed randomly during training, and a second where the paddle was simultaneously trained on three additional neural networks such that it could develop a sense of ""certainty"" as to how probable its own predicted paddle position will be to return the ball. If the agent was less than 95% certain to return the ball, the policy used an intuition neural network to place the paddle. We trained both architectures for an equivalent number of epochs and tested learning performance by letting the trained programs play against a near-perfect opponent. Through this, we found that the reinforcement learning model that uses an intuition neural network for placing the paddle during reward training quickly overtakes the simple architecture in its ability to outplay the near-perfect opponent, additionally outscoring that opponent by an increasingly wide margin after additional epochs of training.",0
"This paper describes a new evolutionary algorithm that is especially well suited to AI-Assisted Game Design. The approach adopted in this paper is to use observations of AI agents playing the game to estimate the game's quality. Some of best agents for this purpose are General Video Game AI agents, since they can be deployed directly on a new game without game-specific tuning; these agents tend to be based on stochastic algorithms which give robust but noisy results and tend to be expensive to run. This motivates the main contribution of the paper: the development of the novel N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm, where a model is used to estimate the fitness of unsampled points and a bandit approach is used to balance exploration and exploitation of the search space. Initial results on optimising a Space Battle game variant suggest that the algorithm offers far more robust results than the Random Mutation Hill Climber and a Biased Mutation variant, which are themselves known to offer competitive performance across a range of problems. Subjective observations are also given by human players on the nature of the evolved games, which indicate a preference towards games generated by the N-Tuple algorithm.",0

"Decomposable dependency models and their graphical counterparts, i.e., chordal graphs, possess a number of interesting and useful properties.

We also propose an algorithm for learning chordal approximations of dependency models isomorphic to general undirected graphs.",0
"In fair division of indivisible goods, using sequences of sincere choices (or picking sequences) is a natural way to allocate the objects. The idea is the following: at each stage, a designated agent picks one object among those that remain. This paper, restricted to the case where the agents have numerical additive preferences over objects, revisits to some extent the seminal paper by Brams and King [9] which was specific to ordinal and linear order preferences over items. We point out similarities and differences with this latter context. In particular, we show that any Pareto-optimal allocation (under additive preferences) is sequenceable, but that the converse is not true anymore. This asymmetry leads naturally to the definition of a ""scale of efficiency"" having three steps: Pareto-optimality, sequenceability without Pareto-optimality, and non-sequenceability. Finally, we investigate the links between these efficiency properties and the ""scale of fairness"" we have described in an earlier work [7]: we first show that an allocation can be envy-free and non-sequenceable, but that every competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is sequenceable. Then we experimentally explore the links between the scales of efficiency and fairness.",0
"In the domain of online advertising, our aim is to serve the best ad to a user who visits a certain webpage, to maximize the chance of a desired action to be performed by this user after seeing the ad. While it is possible to generate a different prediction model for each user to tell if he/she will act on a given ad, the prediction result typically will be quite unreliable with huge variance, since the desired actions are extremely sparse, and the set of users is huge (hundreds of millions) and extremely volatile, i.e., a lot of new users are introduced everyday, or are no longer valid. In this paper we aim to improve the accuracy in finding users who will perform the desired action, by assigning each user to a cluster, where the number of clusters is much smaller than the number of users (in the order of hundreds). Each user will fall into the same cluster with another user if their event history are similar. For this purpose, we modify the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model by assuming the independence of the user and the cluster id, given the history of events. This assumption helps us to identify a cluster of a new user without re-clustering all the users. We present the details of the algorithm we employed as well as the distributed implementation on Hadoop, and some initial results on the clusters that were generated by the algorithm.",0
Online media offers opportunities to marketers to deliver brand messages to a large audience. Advertising technology platforms enables the advertisers to find the proper group of audiences and deliver ad impressions to them in real time. The recent growth of the real time bidding has posed a significant challenge on monitoring such a complicated system. With so many components we need a reliable system that detects the possible changes in the system and alerts the engineering team. In this paper we describe the mechanism that we invented for recovering the representative metrics and detecting the change in their behavior. We show that this mechanism is able to detect the possible problems in time by describing some incident cases.,0
"Obtaining a survival strategy (policy) is one of the fundamental problems of biological agents. In this paper, we generalize the formulation of previous research related to the survival of an agent and we formulate the survival problem as a maximization of the multi-step survival probability in future time steps. We introduce a method for converting the maximization of multi-step survival probability into a classical reinforcement learning problem. Using this conversion, the reward function (negative temporal cost function) is expressed as the log of the temporal survival probability. And we show that the objective function of the reinforcement learning in this sense is proportional to the variational lower bound of the original problem. Finally, We empirically demonstrate that the agent learns survival behavior by using the reward function introduced in this paper.",0
"The need for an ontological layer on top of data, associated with advanced reasoning mechanisms able to exploit the semantics encoded in ontologies, has been acknowledged both in the database and knowledge representation communities. We focus in this paper on the ontological query answering problem, which consists of querying data while taking ontological knowledge into account. More specifically, we establish complexities of the conjunctive query entailment problem for classes of existential rules (also called tuple-generating dependencies, Datalog+/- rules, or forall-exists-rules. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce the class of greedy bounded-treewidth sets (gbts) of rules, which covers guarded rules, and their most well-known generalizations. We provide a generic algorithm for query entailment under gbts, which is worst-case optimal for combined complexity with or without bounded predicate arity, as well as for data complexity and query complexity. Secondly, we classify several gbts classes, whose complexity was unknown, with respect to combined complexity (with both unbounded and bounded predicate arity) and data complexity to obtain a comprehensive picture of the complexity of existential rule fragments that are based on diverse guardedness notions. Upper bounds are provided by showing that the proposed algorithm is optimal for all of them.",0
"This paper proposes Monte Carlo Action Programming, a programming language framework for autonomous systems that act in large probabilistic state spaces with high branching factors. It comprises formal syntax and semantics of a nondeterministic action programming language. The language is interpreted stochastically via Monte Carlo Tree Search. Effectiveness of the approach is shown empirically.",0
"A new search algorithm for solving distributed constraint optimization problems (DisCOPs) is presented. Agents assign variables sequentially and compute bounds on partial assignments asynchronously. The asynchronous bounds computation is based on the propagation of partial assignments. The asynchronous forward-bounding algorithm (AFB) is a distributed optimization search algorithm that keeps one consistent partial assignment at all times. The algorithm is described in detail and its correctness proven. Experimental evaluation shows that AFB outperforms synchronous branch and bound by many orders of magnitude, and produces a phase transition as the tightness of the problem increases. This is an analogous effect to the phase transition that has been observed when local consistency maintenance is applied to MaxCSPs. The AFB algorithm is further enhanced by the addition of a backjumping mechanism, resulting in the AFB-BJ algorithm. Distributed backjumping is based on accumulated information on bounds of all values and on processing concurrently a queue of candidate goals for the next move back. The AFB-BJ algorithm is compared experimentally to other DisCOP algorithms (ADOPT, DPOP, OptAPO) and is shown to be a very efficient algorithm for DisCOPs.",0
"Compiling Bayesian networks (BNs) to junction trees and performing belief propagation over them is among the most prominent approaches to computing posteriors in BNs. However, belief propagation over junction tree is known to be computationally intensive in the general case. Its complexity may increase dramatically with the connectivity and state space cardinality of Bayesian network nodes. In this paper, we address this computational challenge using GPU parallelization. We develop data structures and algorithms that extend existing junction tree techniques, and specifically develop a novel approach to computing each belief propagation message in parallel. We implement our approach on an NVIDIA GPU and test it using BNs from several applications. Experimentally, we study how junction tree parameters affect parallelization opportunities and hence the performance of our algorithm. We achieve speedups ranging from 0.68 to 9.18 for the BNs studied.",0
"Symmetries in discrete constraint satisfaction problems have been explored and exploited in the last years, but symmetries in continuous constraint problems have not received the same attention. Here we focus on permutations of the variables consisting of one single cycle. We propose a procedure that takes advantage of these symmetries by interacting with a continuous constraint solver without interfering with it. A key concept in this procedure are the classes of symmetric boxes formed by bisecting a n-dimensional cube at the same point in all dimensions at the same time. We analyze these classes and quantify them as a function of the cube dimensionality. Moreover, we propose a simple algorithm to generate the representatives of all these classes for any number of variables at very high rates. A problem example from the chemical and#64257;eld and the cyclic n-roots problem are used to show the performance of the approach in practice.",0
"When a processing unit relies on data from external streams, we may face the problem that the stream data needs to be rearranged in a way that allows the unit to perform its task(s). On arrival of new data, we must decide whether there is sufficient information available to start processing or whether to wait for more data. Furthermore, we need to ensure that the data meets the input specification of the processing step. In the case of multiple input streams it is also necessary to coordinate which data from which incoming stream should form the input of the next process instantiation. In this work, we propose a declarative approach as an interface between multiple streams and a processing unit. The idea is to specify via answer-set programming how to arrange incoming data in packages that are suitable as input for subsequent processing. Our approach is intended for use in asynchronous multi-context systems (aMCSs), a recently proposed framework for loose coupling of knowledge representation formalisms that allows for online reasoning in a dynamic environment. Contexts in aMCSs process data streams from external sources and other contexts.",0
We propose an integration of possibility theory into non-classical logics. We obtain many formal results that generalize the case where possibility and necessity functions are based on classical logic. We show how useful such an approach is by applying it to reasoning under uncertain and inconsistent information.,0
"The problem of similarity search is one of the main problems in computer science. This problem has many applications in text-retrieval, web search, computational biology, bioinformatics and others. Similarity between two data objects can be depicted using a similarity measure or a distance metric. There are numerous distance metrics in the literature, some are used for a particular data type, and others are more general. In this paper we present a new distance metric for sequential data which is based on the sum of n-grams. The novelty of our distance is that these n-grams are weighted using artificial bee colony; a recent optimization algorithm based on the collective intelligence of a swarm of bees on their search for nectar. This algorithm has been used in optimizing a large number of numerical problems. We validate the new distance experimentally.",0
"Numerous important problems can be framed as learning from graph data. We propose a framework for learning convolutional neural networks for arbitrary graphs. These graphs may be undirected, directed, and with both discrete and continuous node and edge attributes. Analogous to image-based convolutional networks that operate on locally connected regions of the input, we present a general approach to extracting locallyconnected regions from graphs. Using established benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that the learned feature representations are competitive with state of the art graph kernels and that their computation is highly efficient.",1
"In cognitive sciences it is not uncommon to use various games effectively. For example, in artificial intelligence, the RoboCup initiative was to set up to catalyse research on the field of autonomous agent technology. In this paper, we introduce a similar soccer simulation initiative to try to investigate a model of human consciousness and a notion of reality in the form of a cognitive problem. In addition, for example, the home pitch advantage and the objective role of the supporters could be naturally described and discussed in terms of this new soccer simulation model.",0
"Programming by Example (PBE) targets at automatically inferring a computer program for accomplishing a certain task from sample input and output. In this paper, we propose a deep neural networks (DNN) based PBE model called Neural Programming by Example (NPBE), which can learn from input-output strings and induce programs that solve the string manipulation problems. Our NPBE model has four neural network based components: a string encoder, an input-output analyzer, a program generator, and a symbol selector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NPBE by training it end-to-end to solve some common string manipulation problems in spreadsheet systems. The results show that our model can induce string manipulation programs effectively. Our work is one step towards teaching DNN to generate computer programs.",1
"We address the problem of anytime prediction in neural networks. An anytime predictor automatically adjusts to and utilizes available test-time budget: it produces a crude initial result quickly and continuously refines the result afterwards. Traditional feed-forward networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks, but cannot produce anytime predictions during their typically expensive computation. In this work, we propose to add auxiliary predictions in a residual network to generate anytime predictions, and optimize these predictions simultaneously. We solve this multi-objective optimization by minimizing a carefully constructed weighted sum of losses. We also oscillate weightings of the losses in each iteration to avoid spurious solutions that are optimal for the sum but not for each individual loss. The proposed approach produces competitive results if computation is interrupted early, and the same level of performance as the original network once computation is finished. Observing that the relative performance gap between the optimal and our proposed anytime network shrinks as the network is near completion, we propose a method to combine anytime networks to achieve more accurate anytime predictions with a constant fraction of additional cost. We evaluate the proposed methods on real-world visual recognition data-sets to demonstrate their anytime performance.",0
"It is widely acknowledged that function symbols are an important feature in answer set programming, as they make modeling easier, increase the expressive power, and allow us to deal with infinite domains. The main issue with their introduction is that the evaluation of a program might not terminate and checking whether it terminates or not is undecidable. To cope with this problem, several classes of logic programs have been proposed where the use of function symbols is restricted but the program evaluation termination is guaranteed. Despite the significant body of work in this area, current approaches do not include many simple practical programs whose evaluation terminates. In this paper, we present the novel classes of rule-bounded and cycle-bounded programs, which overcome different limitations of current approaches by performing a more global analysis of how terms are propagated from the body to the head of rules. Results on the correctness, the complexity, and the expressivity of the proposed approach are provided.",0
"We propose a major revision of the format XCSP 2.1, called XCSP3, to build integrated representations of combinatorial constrained problems. This new format is able to deal with mono/multi optimization, many types of variables, cost functions, reification, views, annotations, variable quantification, distributed, probabilistic and qualitative reasoning. The new format is made compact, highly readable, and rather easy to parse. Interestingly, it captures the structure of the problem models, through the possibilities of declaring arrays of variables, and identifying syntactic and semantic groups of constraints. The number of constraints is kept under control by introducing a limited set of basic constraint forms, and producing almost automatically some of their variations through lifting, restriction, sliding, logical combination and relaxation mechanisms. As a result, XCSP3 encompasses practically all constraints that can be found in major constraint solvers developed by the CP community. A website, which is developed conjointly with the format, contains many models and series of instances. The user can make sophisticated queries for selecting instances from very precise criteria. The objective of XCSP3 is to ease the effort required to test and compare different algorithms by providing a common test-bed of combinatorial constrained instances.",0
"Deep neural networks trained on large supervised datasets have led to impressive results in recent years. However, since well-annotated datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to collect, recent work has explored the use of larger but noisy datasets that can be more easily obtained. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of deep neural networks on training sets with massively noisy labels. We show that successful learning is possible even with an essentially arbitrary amount of noise. For example, on MNIST we find that accuracy of above 90 percent is still attainable even when the dataset has been diluted with 100 noisy examples for each clean example. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when noisy labels are biased towards confusing classes. Further, we show how the required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise. Finally, we present simple actionable techniques for improving learning in the regime of high label noise.",0
"In this paper, we establish some theoretical connections between Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). We prove that every SPN can be converted into a BN in linear time and space in terms of the network size. The key insight is to use Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs) to compactly represent the local conditional probability distributions at each node in the resulting BN by exploiting context-specific independence (CSI). The generated BN has a simple directed bipartite graphical structure. We show that by applying the Variable Elimination algorithm (VE) to the generated BN with ADD representations, we can recover the original SPN where the SPN can be viewed as a history record or caching of the VE inference process. To help state the proof clearly, we introduce the notion of {\em normal} SPN and present a theoretical analysis of the consistency and decomposability properties. We conclude the paper with some discussion of the implications of the proof and establish a connection between the depth of an SPN and the tree-width of its corresponding BN.",1
"We examine the practicality for a user of using Answer Set Programming (ASP) for representing logical formalisms. We choose as an example a formalism aiming at capturing causal explanations from causal information. We provide an implementation, showing the naturalness and relative efficiency of this translation job. We are interested in the ease for writing an ASP program, in accordance with the claimed ``declarative'' aspect of ASP. Limitations of the earlier systems (poor data structure and difficulty in reusing pieces of programs) made that in practice, the ``declarative aspect'' was more theoretical than practical. We show how recent improvements in working ASP systems facilitate a lot the translation, even if a few improvements could still be useful.",0
"With the transition from people's traditional `brick-and-mortar' shopping to online mobile shopping patterns in web 2.0 $\mathit{era}$, the recommender system plays a critical role in E-Commerce and E-Retails. This is especially true when designing this system for more than $\mathbf{236~million}$ daily active users. Ranking strategy, the key module of the recommender system, needs to be precise, accurate, and responsive for estimating customers' intents. We propose a dynamic ranking paradigm, named as DNN-MAB, that is composed of a pairwise deep neural network (DNN) $\mathit{pre}$-ranker connecting a revised multi-armed bandit (MAB) dynamic $\mathit{post}$-ranker. By taking into account of explicit and implicit user feedbacks such as impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. DNN-MAB is able to adjust DNN $\mathit{pre}$-ranking scores to assist customers locating items they are interested in most so that they can converge quickly and frequently. To the best of our knowledge, frameworks like DNN-MAB have not been discussed in the previous literature to either E-Commerce or machine learning audiences. In practice, DNN-MAB has been deployed to production and it easily outperforms against other state-of-the-art models by significantly lifting the gross merchandise volume (GMV) which is the objective metrics at JD.",0
"This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs) as individual layers in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks. These layers allow complex dependencies between the hidden states to be captured that traditional convolutional and fully-connected layers are not able to capture. In this paper, we develop the foundations for such an architecture: we derive the equations to perform exact differentiation through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one particularly standout example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play Sudoku given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this task is virtually impossible for other neural network architectures that we have experimented with, and highlights the representation capabilities of our approach.",1
"Tabling has been used for some time to improve efficiency of Prolog programs by memorizing answered queries. The same idea can be naturally used to memorize visited states during search for planning. In this paper we present a planner developed in the Picat language to solve the Petrobras planning problem. Picat is a novel Prolog-like language that provides pattern matching, deterministic and non-deterministic rules, and tabling as its core modelling and solving features. We demonstrate these capabilities using the Petrobras problem, where the goal is to plan transport of cargo items from ports to platforms using vessels with limited capacity. Monte Carlo Tree Search has been so far the best technique to tackle this problem and we will show that by using tabling we can achieve much better runtime efficiency and better plan quality.",0
"Model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning has generated significant interest in the AI community as it provides an elegant solution to the optimal exploration-exploitation tradeoff in classical reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, the applicability of this type of approach has been limited to small domains due to the high complexity of reasoning about the joint posterior over model parameters. In this paper, we consider the use of factored representations combined with online planning techniques, to improve scalability of these methods. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian framework for learning the structure and parameters of a dynamical system, while also simultaneously planning a (near-)optimal sequence of actions.",0
"One of the fundamental problems in crowdsourcing is the trade-off between number of workers needed for high-accuracy aggregation and the budget to pay. For saving budget, it is important to ensure high quality of the crowd-sourced labels, hence the total cost on label collection will be reduced. Since the self-confidence of workers often has close relationship with their abilities, a possible way for quality control is to request workers to work on problems only when they feel confident, by means of providing unsure option to them. On the other hand, allowing workers to choose unsure option also leads to the potential danger of budget waste. In this work, we propose the analysis towards understanding when providing unsure option indeed leads to significant cost reduction, as well as how the confidence threshold is set. We also propose an online mechanism, which is alternative for threshold selection when the estimation of the crowd ability distribution is difficult.",0
"Most of the existing image-to-image translation frameworks---mapping an image in one domain to a corresponding image in another---are based on supervised learning, i.e., pairs of corresponding images in two domains are required for learning the translation function. This largely limits their applications, because capturing corresponding images in two different domains is often a difficult task. To address the issue, we propose the UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (UNIT) framework, which is based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. The proposed framework can learn the translation function without any corresponding images in two domains. We enable this learning capability by combining a weight-sharing constraint and an adversarial training objective. Through visualization results from various unsupervised image translation tasks, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. An ablation study further reveals the critical design choices. Moreover, we apply the UNIT framework to the unsupervised domain adaptation task and achieve better results than competing algorithms do in benchmark datasets.",1
"We present a novel framework for generating pop music. Our model is a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, where the layers and the structure of the hierarchy encode our prior knowledge about how pop music is composed. In particular, the bottom layers generate the melody, while the higher levels produce the drums and chords. We conduct several human studies that show strong preference of our generated music over that produced by the recent method by Google. We additionally show two applications of our framework: neural dancing and karaoke, as well as neural story singing.",0
"We consider the problem of learning deep generative models from data. We formulate a method that generates an independent sample via a single feedforward pass through a multilayer perceptron, as in the recently proposed generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Training a generative adversarial network, however, requires careful optimization of a difficult minimax program. Instead, we utilize a technique from statistical hypothesis testing known as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), which leads to a simple objective that can be interpreted as matching all orders of statistics between a dataset and samples from the model, and can be trained by backpropagation. We further boost the performance of this approach by combining our generative network with an auto-encoder network, using MMD to learn to generate codes that can then be decoded to produce samples. We show that the combination of these techniques yields excellent generative models compared to baseline approaches as measured on MNIST and the Toronto Face Database.",1
"Classical game theory treats players as special---a description of a game contains a full, explicit enumeration of all players---even though in the real world, ""players"" are no more fundamentally special than rocks or clouds. It isn't trivial to find a decision-theoretic foundation for game theory in which an agent's coplayers are a non-distinguished part of the agent's environment. Attempts to model both players and the environment as Turing machines, for example, fail for standard diagonalization reasons.",0
"The challenge stated in the title can be divided into two main problems. The first problem is to reliably mimic the way that users interact with user interfaces. The second problem is to build an instructible agent, i.e. one that can be taught to execute tasks expressed as previously unseen natural language commands. This paper proposes a solution to the second problem, a system we call Helpa. End-users can teach Helpa arbitrary new tasks whose level of complexity is similar to the tasks available from today's most popular virtual assistants. Teaching Helpa does not involve any programming. Instead, users teach Helpa by providing just one example of a command paired with a demonstration of how to execute that command. Helpa does not rely on any pre-existing domain-specific knowledge. It is therefore completely domain-independent. Our usability study showed that end-users can teach Helpa many new tasks in less than a minute each, often much less.",0
"Information and computation have transformed the way we look at the world beyond statistical correlations, the way we can perform experiments, through simulations, and the way we can test these hypotheses. In previous work we introduced a concept of ""algorithmicity"" and of ""programmability"". Biology has already taken steps towards becoming a computer science aiming at reprogramming nature after the realisation that nature herself has reprogrammed organisms by harnessing the power of natural selection. We further unpack these ideas related to computability, algorithmic information theory and software engineering, in the context of the extent to which biology can be (re)programmed, and with how we may go about doing so in a more systematic way with all the tools and concepts offered by theoretical computer science in an translation exercise from computing to molecular biology and back. These concepts provide a means to a hierarchical organization thereby blurring previously clear-cut lines between concepts like matter and life, or between tumour types that are otherwise taken as different and may not have however a different cause. This does not diminish the properties of life or make its components and functions less interesting. On the contrary, this approach makes for a more encompassing and integrated view of nature, one that subsumes observer and observed within the same system, and can generate new perspectives and tools with which to view complex diseases like cancer, approaching them afresh from a software-engineering viewpoint that casts evolution in the role of programmer, cells as computer programs, the immune system as a program debugging tool, and diseases as a battlefield where these forces deploy.",0
"Knowledge base is the way to store structured and unstructured data throughout the web. Since the size of the web is increasing rapidly, there are huge needs to structure the knowledge in a fully automated way. However fully-automated knowledge-base evolution on the Semantic Web is a major challenges, although there are many ontology evolution techniques available. Therefore learning ontology automatically can contribute to the semantic web society significantly. In this paper, we propose full-automated ontology learning algorithm to generate refined knowledge base from incomplete knowledge base and rdf-triples. Our algorithm is data-driven approach which is based on the property of each instance. Ontology class is being elaborated by generalizing frequent property of its instances. By using that developed class information, each instance can find its most relatively matching class. By repeating these two steps, we achieve fully-automated ontology evolution from incomplete basic knowledge base.",0
"Many existing global constraints can be encoded as a conjunction of among constraints. An among constraint holds if the number of the variables in its scope whose value belongs to a prespecified set, which we call its range, is within some given bounds. It is known that domain filtering algorithms can benefit from reasoning about the interaction of among constraints so that values can be filtered out taking into consideration several among constraints simultaneously. The present pa- per embarks into a systematic investigation on the circumstances under which it is possible to obtain efficient and complete domain filtering algorithms for conjunctions of among constraints. We start by observing that restrictions on both the scope and the range of the among constraints are necessary to obtain meaningful results. Then, we derive a domain flow-based filtering algorithm and present several applications. In particular, it is shown that the algorithm unifies and generalizes several previous existing results.",0
"In this paper, we present subgraph2vec, a novel approach for learning latent representations of rooted subgraphs from large graphs inspired by recent advancements in Deep Learning and Graph Kernels. These latent representations encode semantic substructure dependencies in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models for tasks such as graph classification, clustering, link prediction and community detection. subgraph2vec leverages on local information obtained from neighbourhoods of nodes to learn their latent representations in an unsupervised fashion. We demonstrate that subgraph vectors learnt by our approach could be used in conjunction with classifiers such as CNNs, SVMs and relational data clustering algorithms to achieve significantly superior accuracies. Also, we show that the subgraph vectors could be used for building a deep learning variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. Our experiments on several benchmark and large-scale real-world datasets reveal that subgraph2vec achieves significant improvements in accuracies over existing graph kernels on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Specifically, on two realworld program analysis tasks, namely, code clone and malware detection, subgraph2vec outperforms state-of-the-art kernels by more than 17% and 4%, respectively.",0
"Online learning is a familiar problem setting within Machine-Learning in which data is presented serially in time to a learning agent, requiring it to progressively adapt within the constraints of the learning algorithm. More sophisticated variants may involve concepts such as transfer-learning which increase this adaptive capability, enhancing the learner's cognitive capacities in a manner that can begin to imitate the open-ended learning capabilities of human beings.",0
"Evolution has resulted in highly developed abilities in many natural intelligences to quickly and accurately predict mechanical phenomena. Humans have successfully developed laws of physics to abstract and model such mechanical phenomena. In the context of artificial intelligence, a recent line of work has focused on estimating physical parameters based on sensory data and use them in physical simulators to make long-term predictions. In contrast, we investigate the effectiveness of a single neural network for end-to-end long-term prediction of mechanical phenomena. Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that such networks can outperform alternate approaches having even access to ground-truth physical simulators, especially when some physical parameters are unobserved or not known a-priori. Further, our network outputs a distribution of outcomes to capture the inherent uncertainty in the data. Our approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of making actionable long-term predictions from sensor data without requiring to explicitly model the underlying physical laws.",0
"We present in this paper our law that there is always a connection present between two entities, with a selfconnection being present at least in each node. An entity is an object, physical or imaginary, that is connected by a path (or connection) and which is important for achieving the desired result of the scenario. In machine learning, we state that for any scenario, a subject entity is always, directly or indirectly, connected and affected by single or multiple independent / dependent entities, and their impact on the subject entity is dependent on various factors falling into the categories such as the existenc",0
"Noisy data, non-convex objectives, model misspecification, and numerical instability can all cause undesired behaviors in machine learning systems. As a result, detecting actual implementation errors can be extremely difficult. We demonstrate a methodology in which developers use an interactive proof assistant to both implement their system and to state a formal theorem defining what it means for their system to be correct. The process of proving this theorem interactively in the proof assistant exposes all implementation errors since any error in the program would cause the proof to fail. As a case study, we implement a new system, Certigrad, for optimizing over stochastic computation graphs, and we generate a formal (i.e. machine-checkable) proof that the gradients sampled by the system are unbiased estimates of the true mathematical gradients. We train a variational autoencoder using Certigrad and find the performance comparable to training the same model in TensorFlow.",1
"Previous studies have proposed image-based clutter measures that correlate with human search times and/or eye movements. However, most models do not take into account the fact that the effects of clutter interact with the foveated nature of the human visual system: visual clutter further from the fovea has an increasing detrimental influence on perception. Here, we introduce a new foveated clutter model to predict the detrimental effects in target search utilizing a forced fixation search task. We use Feature Congestion (Rosenholtz et al.) as our non foveated clutter model, and we stack a peripheral architecture on top of Feature Congestion for our foveated model. We introduce the Peripheral Integration Feature Congestion (PIFC) coefficient, as a fundamental ingredient of our model that modulates clutter as a non-linear gain contingent on eccentricity. We finally show that Foveated Feature Congestion (FFC) clutter scores r(44) = -0.82 correlate better with target detection (hit rate) than regular Feature Congestion r(44) = -0.19 in forced fixation search. Thus, our model allows us to enrich clutter perception research by computing fixation specific clutter maps. A toolbox for creating peripheral architectures: Piranhas: Peripheral Architectures for Natural, Hybrid and Artificial Systems will be made available.",1
"Here a novel idea to handle imprecise or vague set viz. Pseudo fuzzy set has been proposed. Pseudo fuzzy set is a triplet of element and its two membership functions. Both the membership functions may or may not be dependent. The hypothesis is that every positive sense has some negative sense. So, one membership function has been considered as positive and another as negative. Considering this concept, here the development of Pseudo fuzzy set and its property along with Pseudo fuzzy numbers has been discussed.",0
We propose a new framework for abstractive text summarization based on a sequence-to-sequence oriented encoder-decoder model equipped with a deep recurrent generative decoder (DRGN).,1
"As large-scale theft of data from corporate servers is becoming increasingly common, it becomes interesting to examine alternatives to the paradigm of centralizing sensitive data into large databases. Instead, one could use cryptography and distributed computation so that sensitive data can be supplied and processed in encrypted form, and only the final result is made known. In this paper, we examine how such a paradigm can be used to implement constraint satisfaction, a technique that can solve a broad class of AI problems such as resource allocation, planning, scheduling, and diagnosis. Most previous work on privacy in constraint satisfaction only attempted to protect specific types of information, in particular the feasibility of particular combinations of decisions. We formalize and extend these restricted notions of privacy by introducing four types of private information, including the feasibility of decisions and the final decisions made, but also the identities of the participants and the topology of the problem. We present distributed algorithms that allow computing solutions to constraint satisfaction problems while maintaining these four types of privacy. We formally prove the privacy properties of these algorithms, and show experiments that compare their respective performance on benchmark problems.",0
"Expected Utility: Algebraic Expected Utility In this paper, we provide two axiomatizations of algebraic expected utility, which is a particular generalized expected utility, in a von Neumann-Morgenstern setting, i.e. uncertainty representation is supposed to be given and here to be described by a plausibility measure valued on a semiring, which could be partially ordered. We show that axioms identical to those for expected utility entail that preferences are represented by an algebraic expected utility. This algebraic approach allows many previous propositions (expected utility, binary possibilistic utility,...) to be unified in a same general framework and proves that the obtained utility enjoys the same nice features as expected utility: linearity, dynamic consistency, autoduality of the underlying uncertainty measure, autoduality of the decision criterion and possibility of modeling decision maker's attitude toward uncertainty.",0
"The Singleton Property (SP) approach has been proposed for representing and querying metadata about RDF triples such as provenance, time, location, and evidence. In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.",0
"This paper introduces the independent choice logic, and in particular the ""single agent with nature"" instance of the independent choice logic, namely ICLdt. This is a logical framework for decision making uncertainty that extends both logic programming and stochastic models such as influence diagrams. This paper shows how the representation of a decision problem within the independent choice logic can be exploited to cut down the combinatorics of dynamic programming. One of the main problems with influence diagram evaluation techniques is the need to optimise a decision for all values of the 'parents' of a decision variable. In this paper we show how the rule based nature of the ICLdt can be exploited so that we only make distinctions in the values of the information available for a decision that will make a difference to utility.",0
"Epistemic logic with non-standard knowledge operators, especially the ""knowing-value"" operator, has recently gathered much attention. With the ""knowing-value"" operator, we can express knowledge of individual variables, but not of the relations between them in general. In this paper, we propose a new operator Kf to express knowledge of the functional dependencies between variables. The semantics of this Kf operator uses a function domain which imposes a constraint on what counts as a functional dependency relation. By adjusting this function domain, different interesting logics arise, and in this paper we axiomatize three such logics in a single agent setting. Then we show how these three logics can be unified by allowing the function domain to vary relative to different agents and possible worlds. A multiagent axiomatization is given in this case.",0
"Numerous temporal inference tasks such as fault monitoring and anomaly detection exhibit a persistence property: for example, if something breaks, it stays broken until an intervention. When modeled as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, persistence adds dependencies between adjacent time slices, often making exact inference over time intractable using standard inference algorithms. However, we show that persistence implies a regular structure that can be exploited for efficient inference. We present three successively more general classes of models: persistent causal chains (PCCs), persistent causal trees (PCTs) and persistent polytrees (PPTs), and the corresponding exact inference algorithms that exploit persistence. We show that analytic asymptotic bounds for our algorithms compare favorably to junction tree inference; and we demonstrate empirically that we can perform exact smoothing on the order of 100 times faster than the approximate Boyen-Koller method on randomly generated instances of persistent tree models. We also show how to handle non-persistent variables and how persistence can be exploited effectively for approximate filtering.",0
"The nursing literature shows that cultural competence is an important requirement for effective healthcare. We claim that personal assistive robots should likewise be culturally competent, that is, they should be aware of general cultural characteristics and of the different forms they take in different individuals, and take these into account while perceiving, reasoning, and acting. The CARESSES project is an Europe-Japan collaborative effort that aims at designing, developing and evaluating culturally competent assistive robots. These robots will be able to adapt the way they behave, speak and interact to the cultural identity of the person they assist. This paper describes the approach taken in the CARESSES project, its initial steps, and its future plans.",0
"Functional constraints and bi-functional constraints are an important constraint class in Constraint Programming (CP) systems, in particular for Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) systems. CP systems with finite domain constraints usually employ CSP-based solvers which use local consistency, for example, arc consistency. We introduce a new approach which is based instead on variable substitution. We obtain efficient algorithms for reducing systems involving functional and bi-functional constraints together with other non-functional constraints. It also solves globally any CSP where there exists a variable such that any other variable is reachable from it through a sequence of functional constraints. Our experiments on random problems show that variable elimination can significantly improve the efficiency of solving problems with functional constraints.",0
"We introduce the lifted Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP) message passing algorithm, for the computation of sum-product queries in Probabilistic Relational Models (e.g. Markov logic network). The algorithm forms a compact region graph and establishes a modified version of message passing, which mimics the GBP behavior in a corresponding ground model. The compact graph is obtained by exploiting a graphical representation of clusters, which reduces cluster symmetry detection to isomorphism tests on small local graphs. The framework is thus capable of handling complex models, while remaining domain-size independent.",0
"Generative state estimators based on probabilistic filters and smoothers are one of the most popular classes of state estimators for robots and autonomous vehicles. However, generative models have limited capacity to handle rich sensory observations, such as camera images, since they must model the entire distribution over sensor readings. Discriminative models do not suffer from this limitation, but are typically more complex to train as latent variable models for state estimation. We present an alternative approach where the parameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as a deterministic computation graph, resulting in a simple and effective gradient descent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show that this procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input, such as raw camera images, which must be processed using expressive nonlinear function approximators such as convolutional neural networks. Our model can be viewed as a type of recurrent neural network, and the connection to probabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that is particularly well suited for state estimation. We evaluate our approach on tracking task with raw image inputs. The results show significant improvement over both standard generative approaches and regular recurrent neural networks.",1
"We explore deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent domains. We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multi-agent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.",1
"Top-down induction of decision trees has been observed to suffer from the inadequate functioning of the pruning phase. In particular, it is known that the size of the resulting tree grows linearly with the sample size, even though the accuracy of the tree does not improve. Reduced Error Pruning is an algorithm that has been used as a representative technique in attempts to explain the problems of decision tree learning. In this paper we present analyses of Reduced Error Pruning in three different settings. First we study the basic algorithmic properties of the method, properties that hold independent of the input decision tree and pruning examples. Then we examine a situation that intuitively should lead to the subtree under consideration to be replaced by a leaf node, one in which the class label and attribute values of the pruning examples are independent of each other. This analysis is conducted under two different assumptions. The general analysis shows that the pruning probability of a node fitting pure noise is bounded by a function that decreases exponentially as the size of the tree grows. In a specific analysis we assume that the examples are distributed uniformly to the tree. This assumption lets us approximate the number of subtrees that are pruned because they do not receive any pruning examples. This paper clarifies the different variants of the Reduced Error Pruning algorithm, brings new insight to its algorithmic properties, analyses the algorithm with less imposed assumptions than before, and includes the previously overlooked empty subtrees to the analysis.",0
"Past research has challenged us with the task of showing relational patterns between text-based data and then clustering for predictive analysis using Golay Code technique. We focus on a novel approach to extract metaknowledge in multimedia datasets. Our collaboration has been an on-going task of studying the relational patterns between datapoints based on metafeatures extracted from metaknowledge in multimedia datasets. Those selected are significant to suit the mining technique we applied, Golay Code algorithm.

"We establish optimal bounds on the number of nested propagation steps in $k$-consistency tests. It is known that local consistency algorithms such as arc-, path- and $k$-consistency are not efficiently parallelizable. Their inherent sequential nature is caused by long chains of nested propagation steps, which cannot be executed in parallel. This motivates the question ""What is the minimum number of nested propagation steps that have to be performed by $k$-consistency algorithms on (binary) constraint networks with $n$ variables and domain size $d$?""",0
"We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes. Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.",0
"A* is a best-first search algorithm for finding optimal-cost paths in graphs. A* benefits significantly from parallelism because in many applications, A* is limited by memory usage, so distributed memory implementations of A* that use all of the aggregate memory on the cluster enable problems that can not be solved by serial, single-machine implementations to be solved. We survey approaches to parallel A*, focusing on decentralized approaches to A* which partition the state space among processors. We also survey approaches to parallel, limited-memory variants of A* such as parallel IDA*.",0
We propose a general framework for inconsistency-tolerant query answering within existential rule setting. This framework unifies the main semantics proposed by the state of art and introduces new ones based on cardinality and majority principles. It relies on two key notions: modifiers and inference strategies. An inconsistency-tolerant semantics is seen as a composite modifier plus an inference strategy. We compare the obtained semantics from a productivity point of view.,0
"A semantics is given to possibilistic logic, a logic that handles weighted classical logic formulae, and where weights are interpreted as lower bounds on degrees of certainty or possibility, in the sense of Zadeh's possibility theory. The proposed semantics is based on fuzzy sets of interpretations. It is tolerant to partial inconsistency. Satisfiability is extended from interpretations to fuzzy sets of interpretations, each fuzzy set representing a possibility distribution describing what is known about the state of the world. A possibilistic knowledge base is then viewed as a set of possibility distributions that satisfy it. The refutation method of automated deduction in possibilistic logic, based on previously introduced generalized resolution principle is proved to be sound and complete with respect to the proposed semantics, including the case of partial inconsistency.",0
"Simple Temporal Networks (STNs) provide a powerful and general tool for representing conjunctions of maximum delay constraints over ordered pairs of temporal variables. In this paper we introduce Hyper Temporal Networks (HyTNs), a strict generalization of STNs, to overcome the limitation of considering only conjunctions of constraints but maintaining a practical efficiency in the consistency check of the instances. In a Hyper Temporal Network a single temporal hyperarc constraint may be defined as a set of two or more maximum delay constraints which is satisfied when at least one of these delay constraints is satisfied. HyTNs are meant as a light generalization of STNs offering an interesting compromise. On one side, there exist practical pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for checking consistency and computing feasible schedules for HyTNs. On the other side, HyTNs offer a more powerful model accommodating natural constraints that cannot be expressed by STNs like Trigger off exactly delta min before (after) the occurrence of the first (last) event in a set., which are used to represent synchronization events in some process aware information systems/workflow models proposed in the literature.",0

"Symbolic has been long considered as a language of human intelligence while neural networks have advantages of robust computation and dealing with noisy data. The integration of neural-symbolic can offer better learning and reasoning while providing a means for interpretability through the representation of symbolic knowledge. Although previous works focus intensively on supervised feedforward neural networks, little has been done for the unsupervised counterparts. In this paper we show how to integrate symbolic knowledge into unsupervised neural networks. We exemplify our approach with knowledge in different forms, including propositional logic for DNA promoter prediction and first-order logic for understanding family relationship.",0
"Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NDIS) monitor a network with the aim of discerning malicious from benign activity on that network. While a wide range of approaches have met varying levels of success, most IDS's rely on having access to a database of known attack signatures which are written by security experts. Nowadays, in order to solve problems with false positive alters, correlation algorithms are used to add additional structure to sequences of IDS alerts. However, such techniques are of no help in discovering novel attacks or variations of known attacks, something the human immune system (HIS) is capable of doing in its own specialised domain. This paper presents a novel immune algorithm for application to an intrusion detection problem. The goal is to discover packets containing novel variations of attacks covered by an existing signature base.",0
"Affective multimedia documents such as images, sounds or videos elicit emotional responses in exposed human subjects. These stimuli are stored in affective multimedia databases and successfully used for a wide variety of research in psychology and neuroscience in areas related to attention and emotion processing. Although important all affective multimedia databases have numerous deficiencies which impair their applicability. These problems, which are brought forward in the paper, result in low recall and precision of multimedia stimuli retrieval which makes creating emotion elicitation procedures difficult and labor-intensive. To address these issues a new core ontology STIMONT is introduced. The STIMONT is written in OWL-DL formalism and extends W3C EmotionML format with an expressive and formal representation of affective concepts, high-level semantics, stimuli document metadata and the elicited physiology. The advantages of ontology in description of affective multimedia stimuli are demonstrated in a document retrieval experiment and compared against contemporary keyword-based querying methods. Also, a software tool Intelligent Stimulus Generator for retrieval of affective multimedia and construction of stimuli sequences is presented.",0
"In Computer Vision domain, moving Object Tracking considered as one of the toughest problem.As there so many factors associated like illumination of light, noise, occlusion, sudden start and stop of moving object, shading which makes tracking even harder problem not only for dynamic background but also for static background.In this paper we present a new object tracking algorithm based on Dominant points on tracked object using Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) which is a new different version of PSO based on Quantum theory. The novelty in our approach is that it can be successfully applicable in variable background as well as static background and application of quantum PSO makes the algorithm runs lot faster where other basic PSO algorithm failed to do so due to heavy computation.In our approach firstly dominants points of tracked objects detected, then a group of particles form a swarm are initialized randomly over the image search space and then start searching the curvature connected between two consecutive dominant points until they satisfy fitness criteria. Obviously it is a Multi-Swarm approach as there are multiple dominant points, as they moves, the curvature moves and the curvature movement is tracked by the swarm throughout the video and eventually when the swarm reaches optimal solution , a bounding box drawn based on particles final position.Experimental results demonstrate this proposed QPSO based method work efficiently and effectively in visual object tracking in both dynamic and static environments and run time shows that it runs closely 90% faster than basic PSO.in our approach we also apply parallelism using MatLab Parfor command to show how very less number of iteration and swarm size will enable us to successfully track object.",0
"Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.",1

The software modules behind that as well as the basic utility technologies are essentially powered by PLANET's ARGUS framework for intelligent text recognition and image processing.",0
"Based on the assumption that there exists a neural network that efficiently represents a set of Boolean functions between all binary inputs and outputs, we propose a process for developing and deploying neural networks whose weight parameters, bias terms, input, and intermediate hidden layer output signals, are all binary-valued, and require only basic bit logic for the feedforward pass. The proposed Bitwise Neural Network (BNN) is especially suitable for resource-constrained environments, since it replaces either floating or fixed-point arithmetic with significantly more efficient bitwise operations. Hence, the BNN requires for less spatial complexity, less memory bandwidth, and less power consumption in hardware. In order to design such networks, we propose to add a few training schemes, such as weight compression and noisy backpropagation, which result in a bitwise network that performs almost as well as its corresponding real-valued network. We test the proposed network on the MNIST dataset, represented using binary features, and show that BNNs result in competitive performance while offering dramatic computational savings.",0
"In this extended abstract, we propose Structured Production Systems (SPS), which extend traditional production systems with well-formed syntactic structures. Due to the richness of structures, structured production systems significantly enhance the expressive power as well as the flexibility of production systems, for instance, to handle uncertainty. We show that different rule application strategies can be reduced into the basic one by utilizing structures. Also, many fundamental approaches in computer science, including automata, grammar and logic, can be captured by structured production systems.",0

Checking the existence of a synchronizing sequence and finding a synchronizing sequence, if one exists, can be performed in polynomial time.

In this work, the usefulness of Answer Set Programming to solve this optimization problem is investigated, in comparison with brute-force algorithms and SAT-based approaches.",0

In addition we raise the question whether the intelligence may show fractal properties. Then we sketch a vision of what robotic cars are going to do in the future. Finally we give the specification of an artificial life game based on the concept of orchestrated machines. The purpose of this paper is to start the search for possible relationships between these different topics.",0
"In economics and psychology, delay discounting is often used to characterize how individuals choose between a smaller immediate reward and a larger delayed reward. People with higher delay discounting rate (DDR) often choose smaller but more immediate rewards (a ""today person""). In contrast, people with a lower discounting rate often choose a larger future rewards (a ""tomorrow person""). Since the ability to modulate the desire of immediate gratification for long term rewards plays an important role in our decision-making, the lower discounting rate often predicts better social, academic and health outcomes. In contrast, the higher discounting rate is often associated with problematic behaviors such as alcohol/drug abuse, pathological gambling and credit card default. Thus, research on understanding and moderating delay discounting has the potential to produce substantial societal benefits.",0
"In this paper we describe an original computational model for solving different types of Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DCSP). The proposed model is called Controller-Agents for Constraints Solving (CACS). This model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS application for timetabling problems.",0
"Action languages have emerged as an important field of Knowledge Representation for reasoning about change and causality in dynamic domains. This article presents Cerbere, a production system designed to perform online causal, temporal and epistemic reasoning based on the Event Calculus. The framework implements the declarative semantics of the underlying logic theories in a forward-chaining rule-based reasoning system, coupling the high expressiveness of its formalisms with the efficiency of rule-based systems. To illustrate its applicability, we present both the modeling of benchmark problems in the field, as well as its utilization in the challenging domain of smart spaces. A hybrid framework that combines logic-based with probabilistic reasoning has been developed, that aims to accommodate activity recognition and monitoring tasks in smart spaces.",0

The system is able to interface with a structured database, and interact with users for assisting them to access information and complete tasks such as booking movie tickets. Our experiments in a movie-ticket booking domain show the proposed system outperforms a modular-based dialogue system and is more robust to noise produced by other components in the system.",0
"Standard LDA model suffers the problem that the topic assignment of each word is independent and word correlation hence is neglected. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a model called Word Related Latent Dirichlet Allocation (WR-LDA) by incorporating word correlation into LDA topic models. This leads to new capabilities that standard LDA model does not have such as estimating infrequently occurring words or multi-language topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with standard LDA.",0
"Evaluation of counterfactual queries (e.g., ""If A were true, would C have been true?"") is important to fault diagnosis, planning, determination of liability, and policy analysis. We present a method of revaluating counterfactuals when the underlying causal model is represented by structural models - a nonlinear generalization of the simultaneous equations models commonly used in econometrics and social sciences. This new method provides a coherent means for evaluating policies involving the control of variables which, prior to enacting the policy were influenced by other variables in the system.",0
"Parameterized algorithms are a way to solve hard problems more efficiently, given that a specific parameter of the input is small. In this paper, we apply this idea to the field of answer set programming (ASP). To this end, we propose two kinds of graph representations of programs to exploit their treewidth as a parameter. Treewidth roughly measures to which extent the internal structure of a program resembles a tree. Our main contribution is the design of parameterized dynamic programming algorithms, which run in linear time if the treewidth and weights of the given program are bounded. Compared to previous work, our algorithms handle the full syntax of ASP. Finally, we report on an empirical evaluation that shows good runtime behaviour for benchmark instances of low treewidth, especially for counting answer sets.",0
"In recent years, work has been done to develop the theory of General Reinforcement Learning (GRL). However, there are few examples demonstrating these results in a concrete way. In particular, there are no examples demonstrating the known results regarding gener- alised discounting. We have added to the GRL simulation platform AIXIjs the functionality to assign an agent arbitrary discount functions, and an environment which can be used to determine the effect of discounting on an agent's policy. Using this, we investigate how geometric, hyperbolic and power discounting affect an informed agent in a simple MDP. We experimentally reproduce a number of theoretical results, and discuss some related subtleties. It was found that the agent's behaviour followed what is expected theoretically, assuming appropriate parameters were chosen for the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planning algorithm.",0
"In this work we present strategies for (optimal) measurement selection in model-based sequential diagnosis. In particular, assuming a set of leading diagnoses being given, we show how queries (sets of measurements) can be computed and optimized along two dimensions: expected number of queries and cost per query. By means of a suitable decoupling of two optimizations and a clever search space reduction the computations are done without any inference engine calls. For the full search space, we give a method requiring only a polynomial number of inferences and guaranteeing query properties existing methods cannot provide. Evaluation results using real-world problems indicate that the new method computes (virtually) optimal queries instantly independently of the size and complexity of the considered diagnosis problems.",0
"The monolithic approach to policy representation in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) looks for a single policy that can be represented as a function from states to actions. For the monolithic approach to succeed (and this is not always possible), a complex feature representation is often necessary since the policy is a complex object that has to prescribe what actions to take all over the state space. This is especially true in large domains with complicated dynamics. It is also computationally inefficient to both learn and plan in MDPs using a complex monolithic approach. We present a different approach where we restrict the policy space to policies that can be represented as combinations of simpler, parameterized skills---a type of temporally extended action, with a simple policy representation. We introduce Learning Skills via Bootstrapping (LSB) that can use a broad family of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms as a ""black box"" to iteratively learn parametrized skills. Initially, the learned skills are short-sighted but each iteration of the algorithm allows the skills to bootstrap off one another, improving each skill in the process. We prove that this bootstrapping process returns a near-optimal policy. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that LSB can solve MDPs that, given the same representational power, could not be solved by a monolithic approach. Thus, planning with learned skills results in better policies without requiring complex policy representations.",0
"An important application of interactive machine learning is extending or amplifying the cognitive and physical capabilities of a human. To accomplish this, machines need to learn about their human users' intentions and adapt to their preferences. In most current research, a user has conveyed preferences to a machine using explicit corrective or instructive feedback; explicit feedback imposes a cognitive load on the user and is expensive in terms of human effort. The primary objective of the current work is to demonstrate that a learning agent can reduce the amount of explicit feedback required for adapting to the user's preferences pertaining to a task by learning to perceive a value of its behavior from the human user, particularly from the user's facial expressions---we call this face valuing. We empirically evaluate face valuing on a grip selection task. Our preliminary results suggest that an agent can quickly adapt to a user's changing preferences with minimal explicit feedback by learning a value function that maps facial features extracted from a camera image to expected future reward. We believe that an agent learning to perceive a value from the body language of its human user is complementary to existing interactive machine learning approaches and will help in creating successful human-machine interactive applications.",0
"Sentiment analysis is crucial for extracting social signals from social media content. Due to the prevalence of images in social media, image sentiment analysis is receiving increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing systems are black-boxes that do not provide insight on how image content invokes sentiment and emotion in the viewers. Psychological studies have confirmed that salient objects in an image often invoke emotions. In this work, we investigate more fine-grained and more comprehensive interaction between visual saliency and visual sentiment. In particular, we partition images in several primary scene-type dimensions, including: open-closed, natural-manmade, indoor-outdoor, and face-noface. Using state of the art saliency detection algorithm and sentiment classification algorithm, we examine how the sentiment of the salient region(s) in an image relates to the overall sentiment of the image. The experiments on a representative image emotion dataset have shown interesting correlation between saliency and sentiment in different scene types and in turn shed light on the mechanism of visual sentiment evocation.",0
"Autonomously detecting and recovering from faults is one approach for reducing the operational complexity and costs associated with managing computing environments. We present a novel methodology for autonomously generating investigation leads that help identify systems faults, and extends our previous work in this area by leveraging Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and contrastive divergence learning to analyse changes in historical feature data. This allows us to heuristically identify the root cause of a fault, and demonstrate an improvement to the state of the art by showing feature data can be predicted heuristically beyond a single instance to include entire sequences of information.",0
"The amount of data generated in the modern society is increasing rapidly. New problems and novel approaches of data capture, storage, analysis and visualization are responsible for the emergence of the Big Data research field. Machine Learning algorithms can be used in Big Data to make better and more accurate inferences. However, because of the challenges Big Data imposes, these algorithms need to be adapted and optimized to specific applications. One important decision made by software engineers is the choice of the language that is used in the implementation of these algorithms. Therefore, this literature survey identifies and describes domain-specific languages and frameworks used for Machine Learning in Big Data. By doing this, software engineers can then make more informed choices and beginners have an overview of the main languages used in this domain.",0
"Path planning is typically considered in Artificial Intelligence as a graph searching problem and R* is state-of-the-art algorithm tailored to solve it. The algorithm decomposes given path finding task into the series of subtasks each of which can be easily (in computational sense) solved by well-known methods (such as A*). Parameterized random choice is used to perform the decomposition and as a result R* performance largely depends on the choice of its input parameters. In our work we formulate a range of assumptions concerning possible upper and lower bounds of R* parameters, their interdependency and their influence on R* performance. Then we evaluate these assumptions by running a large number of experiments. As a result we formulate a set of heuristic rules which can be used to initialize the values of R* parameters in a way that leads to algorithm's best performance.",0
"We study the problem of inferring the type of a networked device in a home network by leveraging low level traffic activity indicators seen at commodity home gateways. We analyze a dataset of detailed device network activity obtained from 240 subscriber homes of a large European ISP and extract a number of traffic and spatial fingerprints for individual devices. We develop a two level taxonomy to describe devices onto which we map individual devices using a number of heuristics. We leverage the heuristically derived labels to train classifiers that distinguish device classes based on the traffic and spatial fingerprints of a device. Our results show an accuracy level up to 91% for the coarse level category and up to 84% for the fine grained category. By incorporating information from other sources (e.g., MAC OUI), we are able to further improve accuracy to above 97% and 92%, respectively. Finally, we also extract a set of simple and human-readable rules that concisely capture the behaviour of these distinct device categories.",0
"This paper explores a novel way for analyzing the tournament structures to find a best suitable one for the tournament under consideration. It concerns about three aspects such as tournament conducting cost, competitiveness development and ranking precision. It then proposes a new method using progress tree to detect potential throwaway matches. The analysis performed using the proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures. As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness. Double elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners. A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in exchange of being able to qualify top four winners. Round-robin gives reliable ranking precision for all participants. However, its conduction cost is very high, and it fails to maintain competitiveness development.",0
"We propose a method for support vector machine classification using indefinite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our algorithm simultaneously computes support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in forming the loss. This can be interpreted as a penalized kernel learning problem where indefinite kernel matrices are treated as a noisy observations of a true Mercer kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efficiently using the projected gradient or analytic center cutting plane methods. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several classic data sets.",1
"Recently, researchers in answer set programming and constraint programming spent significant efforts in the development of hybrid languages and solving algorithms combining the strengths of these traditionally separate fields. These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set programming (CASP). CASP languages and systems proved to be largely successful at providing efficient solutions to problems involving hybrid reasoning tasks, such as scheduling problems with elements of planning. Yet, the development of CASP systems is difficult, requiring non-trivial expertise in multiple areas. This suggests a need for a study identifying general development principles of hybrid systems. Once these principles and their implications are well understood, the development of hybrid languages and systems may become a well-established and well-understood routine process. As a step in this direction, in this paper we conduct a case study aimed at evaluating various integration schemas of CASP methods.",0
"In this paper, a new approximate syllogistic reasoning schema is described that expands some of the approaches expounded in the literature into two ways: (i) a number of different types of quantifiers (logical, absolute, proportional, comparative and exception) taken from Theory of Generalized Quantifiers and similarity quantifiers, taken from statistics, are considered and (ii) any number of premises can be taken into account within the reasoning process. Furthermore, a systematic reasoning procedure to solve the syllogism is also proposed, interpreting it as an equivalent mathematical optimization problem, where the premises constitute the constraints of the searching space for the quantifier in the conclusion.",0
"This work presents Drake, a dynamic executive for temporal plans with choice. Dynamic plan execution strategies allow an autonomous agent to react quickly to unfolding events, improving the robustness of the agent. Prior work developed methods for dynamically dispatching Simple Temporal Networks, and further research enriched the expressiveness of the plans executives could handle, including discrete choices, which are the focus of this work. However, in some approaches to date, these additional choices induce significant storage or latency requirements to make flexible execution possible.",0
"A popular approach to solving large probabilistic systems relies on aggregating states based on a measure of similarity. Many approaches in the literature are heuristic. A number of recent methods rely instead on metrics based on the notion of bisimulation, or behavioral equivalence between states (Givan et al, 2001, 2003; Ferns et al, 2004). An integral component of such metrics is the Kantorovich metric between probability distributions. However, while this metric enables many satisfying theoretical properties, it is costly to compute in practice. In this paper, we use techniques from network optimization and statistical sampling to overcome this problem. We obtain in this manner a variety of distance functions for MDP state aggregation, which differ in the tradeoff between time and space complexity, as well as the quality of the aggregation. We provide an empirical evaluation of these trade-offs.",0
"A branch-and-bound approach to solving influ- ence diagrams has been previously proposed in the literature, but appears to have never been implemented and evaluated - apparently due to the difficulties of computing effective bounds for the branch-and-bound search. In this paper, we describe how to efficiently compute effective bounds, and we develop a practical implementa- tion of depth-first branch-and-bound search for influence diagram evaluation that outperforms existing methods for solving influence diagrams with multiple stages.",0
"The combinatorial explosion that plagues planning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be moderated using state abstraction. Prohibitively large task representations can be condensed such that essential information is preserved, and consequently, solutions are tractably computable. However, exact abstractions, which treat only fully-identical situations as equivalent, fail to present opportunities for abstraction in environments where no two situations are exactly alike. In this work, we investigate approximate state abstractions, which treat nearly-identical situations as equivalent. We present theoretical guarantees of the quality of behaviors derived from four types of approximate abstractions. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that approximate abstractions lead to reduction in task complexity and bounded loss of optimality of behavior in a variety of environments.",1
"Most algorithms for propagating evidence through belief networks have been exact and exhaustive: they produce an exact (point-valued) marginal probability for every node in the network. Often, however, an application will not need information about every n ode in the network nor will it need exact probabilities. We present the localized partial evaluation (LPE) propagation algorithm, which computes interval bounds on the marginal probability of a specified query node by examining a subset of the nodes in the entire network. Conceptually, LPE ignores parts of the network that are ""too far away"" from the queried node to have much impact on its value. LPE has the ""anytime"" property of being able to produce better solutions (tighter intervals) given more time to consider more of the network.",0
"We introduce a temporal model for reasoning on disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and time points in temporal contexts. This temporal model is composed of a labeled temporal algebra and its reasoning algorithms. The labeled temporal algebra defines labeled disjunctive metric point-based constraints, where each disjunct in each input disjunctive constraint is univocally associated to a label. Reasoning algorithms manage labeled constraints, associated label lists, and sets of mutually inconsistent disjuncts. These algorithms guarantee consistency and obtain a minimal network. Additionally, constraints can be organized in a hierarchy of alternative temporal contexts. Therefore, we can reason on context-dependent disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and points. Moreover, the model is able to represent non-binary constraints, such that logical dependencies on disjuncts in constraints can be handled. The computational cost of reasoning algorithms is exponential in accordance with the underlying problem complexity, although some improvements are proposed.",0
"I describe a planning methodology for domains with uncertainty in the form of external events that are not completely predictable. The events are represented by enabling conditions and probabilities of occurrence. The planner is goal-directed and backward chaining, but the subgoals are suggested by analyzing the probability of success of the partial plan rather than being simply the open conditions of the operators in the plan. The partial plan is represented as a Bayesian belief net to compute its probability of success. Since calculating the probability of success of a plan can be very expensive I introduce two other techniques for computing it, one that uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate it and one based on a Markov chain representation that uses knowledge about the dependencies between the predicates describing the domain.",0
"Attribute reduction is one of the most important topics in rough set theory. Heuristic attribute reduction algorithms have been presented to solve the attribute reduction problem. It is generally known that fitness functions play a key role in developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. The monotonicity of fitness functions can guarantee the validity of heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. In probabilistic rough set model, distribution reducts can ensure the decision rules derived from the reducts are compatible with those derived from the original decision table. However, there are few studies on developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts. This is partly due to the fact that there are no monotonic fitness functions that are used to design heuristic attribute reduction algorithms in probabilistic rough set model. The main objective of this paper is to develop heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts in probabilistic rough set model. For one thing, two monotonic fitness functions are constructed, from which equivalence definitions of distribution reducts can be obtained. For another, two modified monotonic fitness functions are proposed to evaluate the significance of attributes more effectively. On this basis, two heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding distribution reducts are developed based on addition-deletion method and deletion method. In particular, the monotonicity of fitness functions guarantees the rationality of the proposed heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. Results of experimental analysis are included to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed fitness functions and distribution reducts.",0
"Perturb and Combine (P&amp;C) group of methods generate multiple versions of the predictor by perturbing the training set or construction and then combining them into a single predictor (Breiman, 1996b). The motive is to improve the accuracy in unstable classification and regression methods. One of the most well known method in this group is Bagging. Arcing or Adaptive Resampling and Combining methods like AdaBoost are smarter variants of P&amp;C methods. In this extended abstract, we lay the groundwork for a new family of methods under the P&amp;C umbrella, known as Evolutionary Sampling (ES). We employ Evolutionary algorithms to suggest smarter sampling in both the feature space (sub-spaces) as well as training samples. We discuss multiple fitness functions to assess ensembles and empirically compare our performance against randomized sampling of training data and feature sub-spaces.",0
"Inductive logic programming, or relational learning, is a powerful paradigm for machine learning or data mining. However, in order for ILP to become practically useful, the efficiency of ILP systems must improve substantially. To this end, the notion of a query pack is introduced: it structures sets of similar queries. Furthermore, a mechanism is described for executing such query packs. A complexity analysis shows that considerable efficiency improvements can be achieved through the use of this query pack execution mechanism. This claim is supported by empirical results obtained by incorporating support for query pack execution in two existing learning systems.",0
"Many efforts have been dedicated to identifying restrictions on ontologies expressed as tuple-generating dependencies (tgds), a.k.a. existential rules, that lead to the decidability for the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries (OMQs). This has given rise to three families of formalisms: guarded, non-recursive, and sticky sets of tgds. In this work, we study the containment problem for OMQs expressed in such formalisms, which is a key ingredient for solving static analysis tasks associated with them. Our main contribution is the development of specially tailored techniques for OMQ containment under the classes of tgds stated above. This enables us to obtain sharp complexity bounds for the problems at hand. We also apply our techniques to pinpoint the complexity of problems associated with two emerging applications of OMQ containment: distribution over components and UCQ rewritability of OMQs.",0
"The Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem is a well-known graph model with relevant applications in diverse domains. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, which combines an effective constraint-based tabu search procedure and two dedicated graph reduction techniques. We verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on 30 classical random benchmark graphs and 25 very large real-life sparse graphs from the popular Koblenz Network Collection (KONECT). The results show that the algorithm improves the best-known results (new lower bounds) for 10 classical benchmarks and obtains the optimal solutions for 14 KONECT instances.",0
"Traditional approaches to non-monotonic reasoning fail to satisfy a number of plausible axioms for belief revision and suffer from conceptual difficulties as well. Recent work on ranked preferential models (RPMs) promises to overcome some of these difficulties. Here we show that RPMs are not adequate to handle iterated belief change. Specifically, we show that RPMs do not always allow for the reversibility of belief change. This result indicates the need for numerical strengths of belief.",0
"Many combinatorial problems deal with preferences and violations, the goal of which is to find solutions with the minimum cost. Weighted constraint satisfaction is a framework for modeling such problems, which consists of a set of cost functions to measure the degree of violation or preferences of different combinations of variable assignments. Typical solution methods for weighted constraint satisfaction problems (WCSPs) are based on branch-and-bound search, which are made practical through the use of powerful consistency techniques such as AC*, FDAC*, EDAC* to deduce hidden cost information and value pruning during search. These techniques, however, are designed to be efficient only on binary and ternary cost functions which are represented in table form. In tackling many real-life problems, high arity (or global) cost functions are required. We investigate efficient representation scheme and algorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high arity cost functions, which are often derived from hard global constraints from classical constraint satisfaction. The literature suggests some global cost functions can be represented as flow networks, and the minimum cost flow algorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in polynomial time. We show that naive adoption of this flow-based algorithmic method for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of null-inverse consistency. We further show how the method can be modified to handle cost projections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of AC* and FDAC* for cost functions with more than two variables. Similar generalization for the stronger EDAC* is less straightforward. We reveal the oscillation problem when enforcing EDAC* on cost functions sharing more than one variable. To avoid oscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak EDGAC* for non-binary cost functions. Using various benchmarks involving the soft variants of hard global constraints ALLDIFFERENT, GCC, SAME, and REGULAR, empirical results demonstrate that our proposal gives improvements of up to an order of magnitude when compared with the traditional constraint optimization approach, both in terms of time and pruning.",0
"It is ""well known"" that in linear models: (1) testable constraints on the marginal distribution of observed variables distinguish certain cases in which an unobserved cause jointly influences several observed variables; (2) the technique of ""instrumental variables"" sometimes permits an estimation of the influence of one variable on another even when the association between the variables may be confounded by unobserved common causes; (3) the association (or conditional probability distribution of one variable given another) of two variables connected by a path or trek can be computed directly from the parameter values associated with each edge in the path or trek; (4) the association of two variables produced by multiple treks can be computed from the parameters associated with each trek; and (5) the independence of two variables conditional on a third implies the corresponding independence of the sums of the variables over all units conditional on the sums over all units of each of the original conditioning variables.These properties are exploited in search procedures. It is also known that properties (2)-(5) do not hold for all Bayes nets with binary variables. We show that (1) holds for all Bayes nets with binary variables and (5) holds for all singly trek-connected Bayes nets of that kind. We further show that all five properties hold for Bayes nets with any DAG and binary variables parameterized with noisy-or and noisy-and gates.",0
"Computing the probability of evidence even with known error bounds is NP-hard. In this paper we address this hard problem by settling on an easier problem. We propose an approximation which provides high confidence lower bounds on probability of evidence but does not have any guarantees in terms of relative or absolute error. Our proposed approximation is a randomized importance sampling scheme that uses the Markov inequality. However, a straight-forward application of the Markov inequality may lead to poor lower bounds. We therefore propose several heuristic measures to improve its performance in practice. Empirical evaluation of our scheme with state-of- the-art lower bounding schemes reveals the promise of our approach.",0
"Yield and quality improvement is of paramount importance to any manufacturing company. One of the ways of improving yield is through discovery of the root causal factors affecting yield.

We apply causal structure learning techniques on real data collected from this line. Specifically, the goal of this work is to learn interpretable causal models from observational data produced by manufacturing lines.",0
"We present a tool, simplify-defun, that transforms the definition of a given function into a simplified definition of a new function, providing a proof checked by ACL2 that the old and new functions are equivalent.

Examples illustrate its utility, in particular for program transformation in synthesis and verification.",0
"Feature weighting is a technique used to approximate the optimal degree of influence of individual features. This paper presents a feature weighting method for Document Image Retrieval System (DIRS) based on keyword spotting. In this method, we weight the feature using coefficient of multiple correlations.

The aim of this paper is to show that feature weighting increases the performance of DIRS. After applying the feature weighting method to DIRS the average precision is 93.23% and average recall become 98.66% respectively",0
"Neutrosophic theory and applications have been expanding in all directions at an astonishing rate especially after the introduction the journal entitled Neutrosophic Sets and Systems. New theories, techniques, algorithms have been rapidly developed.

"The shortest path between two concepts in a taxonomic ontology is commonly used to represent the semantic distance between concepts in the edge-based semantic similarity measures. In the past, the edge counting is considered to be the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and has low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as WordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad domain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this non-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is able to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various general computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of non-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a new path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of concepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of concepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area density of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the local area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based path with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent with the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and can be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment results show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation between edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles benchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in efficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology, thereby successfully solving the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.",0
"This paper focuses on modeling ride requests and their variations over location and time, based on analyzing extensive real-world data from a ride-sharing service. We introduce a graph model that captures the spatial and temporal variability of ride requests and the potentials for ride pooling. We discover these ride request graphs exhibit a well known property called densification power law often found in real graphs modelling human behaviors. We show the pattern of ride requests and the potential of ride pooling for a city can be characterized by the densification factor of the ride request graphs. Previous works have shown that it is possible to automatically generate synthetic versions of these graphs that exhibit a given densification factor. We present an algorithm for automatic generation of synthetic ride request graphs that match quite well the densification factor of ride request graphs from actual ride request data.",0
"Inter-connected objects, either via public or private networks are the near future of modern societies. Such inter-connected objects are referred to as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and/or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). One example of such a system is based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The fleet of such vehicles are prophesied to take on multiple roles involving mundane to high-sensitive, such as, prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to your homes to battlefield deployment for reconnaissance and combat missions. Drones, as we refer to UAVs in this paper, either can operate individually (solo missions) or part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with the base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the activities of the drones. However, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is required, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for the reasons: 1) increase in the number of drone fleets, 2) number of drones in a fleet might be multiple of tens, 3) time-criticality in making decisions by such fleets in the wild, 4) potential communication congestions/lag, and 5) in some cases working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates-limited communication with control centre (i.e., operations spanning long period of times or military usage of such fleets in enemy territory). This self-ware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones that potential utilises swarm intelligence for a) air-traffic and/or flight control management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation while maintaining the mission criteria, d) collaboration with other fleets in the wild (autonomously) and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet of drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.",0

"The paper investigates parameterized approximate message-passing schemes that are based on bounded inference and are inspired by Pearl's belief propagation algorithm (BP). We start with the bounded inference mini-clustering algorithm and then move to the iterative scheme called Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP), that combines both iteration and bounded inference. Algorithm IJGP belongs to the class of Generalized Belief Propagation algorithms, a framework that allowed connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics and is shown empirically to surpass the performance of mini-clustering and belief propagation, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art algorithms on several classes of networks. We also provide insight into the accuracy of iterative BP and IJGP by relating these algorithms to well known classes of constraint propagation schemes.",0
"Drawing an inspiration from behavioral studies of human decision making, we propose here a general parametric framework for multi-armed bandit problem, which extends the standard Thompson Sampling approach to incorporate reward processing biases associated with several neurological and psychiatric conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, and chronic pain. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed parametric approach can often outperform the baseline Thompson Sampling on a variety of datasets. Moreover, from the behavioral modeling perspective, our parametric framework can be viewed as a first step towards a unifying computational model capturing reward processing abnormalities across multiple mental conditions.",0
"We endow prioritised default logic (PDL) with argumentation semantics using the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation, and prove that the conclusions of the justified arguments are exactly the prioritised default extensions. Argumentation semantics for PDL will allow for the application of argument game proof theories to the process of inference in PDL, making the reasons for accepting a conclusion transparent and the inference process more intuitive. This also opens up the possibility for argumentation-based distributed reasoning and communication amongst agents with PDL representations of mental attitudes.",0

Experiments with real-world data sets spanning diverse domains demonstrate that matching-sensitive active learning",1
"Humans are expert in the amount of sensory data they deal with each moment. Human brain not only analyses these data but also starts synthesizing new information from the existing data.

"We study the computational complexity of candidate control in elections with few voters (that is, we take the number of voters as a parameter). We consider both the standard scenario of adding and deleting candidates, where one asks if a given candidate can become a winner (or, in the destructive case, can be precluded from winning) by adding/deleting some candidates, and a combinatorial scenario where adding/deleting a candidate automatically means adding/deleting a whole group of candidates. Our results show that the parameterized complexity of candidate control (with the number of voters as the parameter) is much more varied than in the setting with many voters.",1
"As the education fees are becoming more expensive, more students apply for scholarships. Consequently, hundreds and even thousands of applications need to be handled by the sponsor. To solve the problems, some alternatives based on several attributes (criteria) need to be selected. In order to make a decision on such fuzzy problems, Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Decision Making (FMDAM) can be applied. In this study, Unified Modeling Language (UML) in FMADM with TOPSIS and Weighted Product (WP) methods is applied to select the candidates for academic and non-academic scholarships at Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Kalijaga. Data used were a crisp and fuzzy data. The results show that TOPSIS and Weighted Product FMADM methods can be used to select the most suitable candidates to receive the scholarships since the preference values applied in this method can show applicants with the highest eligibility",0
"Inference for probabilistic graphical models is still very much a practical challenge in large domains. The commonly used and effective belief propagation (BP) algorithm and its generalizations often do not converge when applied to hard, real-life inference tasks. While it is widely recognized that the scheduling of messages in these algorithms may have significant consequences, this issue remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address the question of how to schedule messages for asynchronous propagation so that a fixed point is reached faster and more often. We first show that any reasonable asynchronous BP converges to a unique fixed point under conditions similar to those that guarantee convergence of synchronous BP. In addition, we show that the convergence rate of a simple round-robin schedule is at least as good as that of synchronous propagation. We then propose residual belief propagation (RBP), a novel, easy-to-implement, asynchronous propagation algorithm that schedules messages in an informed way, that pushes down a bound on the distance from the fixed point. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of RBP over state-of-the-art methods for a variety of challenging synthetic and real-life problems: RBP converges significantly more often than other methods; and it significantly reduces running time until convergence, even when other methods converge.",0
"We give solutions to two fundamental computational problems in ontology-based data access with the W3C standard ontology language OWL 2 QL: the succinctness problem for first-order rewritings of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs), and the complexity problem for OMQ answering. We classify OMQs according to the shape of their conjunctive queries (treewidth, the number of leaves) and the existential depth of their ontologies. For each of these classes, we determine the combined complexity of OMQ answering, and whether all OMQs in the class have polynomial-size first-order, positive existential, and nonrecursive datalog rewritings. We obtain the succinctness results using hypergraph programs, a new computational model for Boolean functions, which makes it possible to connect the size of OMQ rewritings and circuit complexity.",0
"We introduce exploration potential, a quantity for that measures how much a reinforcement learning agent has explored its environment class. In contrast to information gain, exploration potential takes the problem's reward structure into account. This leads to an exploration criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic optimality (learning to act optimally across the entire environment class). Our experiments in multi-armed bandits use exploration potential to illustrate how different algorithms make the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.",0
"Deontic logic is a very well researched branch of mathematical logic and philosophy. Various kinds of deontic logics are discussed for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be stepwise transformed into description logic and DL- clauses, such that it can be processed by Hyper, a high performance theorem prover which uses a hypertableau calculus. Two use cases, one from multi-agent research and one from the development of normative system are investigated.",0

"Non-technical losses (NTL) occur during the distribution of electricity in power grids and include, but are not limited to, electricity theft and faulty meters. In emerging countries, they may range up to 40% of the total electricity distributed. In order to detect NTLs, machine learning methods are used that learn irregular consumption patterns from customer data and inspection results. The Big Data paradigm followed in modern machine learning reflects the desire of deriving better conclusions from simply analyzing more data, without the necessity of looking at theory and models. However, the sample of inspected customers may be biased, i.e. it does not represent the population of all customers. As a consequence, machine learning models trained on these inspection results are biased as well and therefore lead to unreliable predictions of whether customers cause NTL or not. In machine learning, this issue is called covariate shift and has not been addressed in the literature on NTL detection yet. In this work, we present a novel framework for quantifying and visualizing covariate shift. We apply it to a commercial data set from Brazil that consists of 3.6M customers and 820K inspection results. We show that some features have a stronger covariate shift than others, making predictions less reliable. In particular, previous inspections were focused on certain neighborhoods or customer classes and that they were not sufficiently spread among the population of customers. This framework is about to be deployed in a commercial product for NTL detection.",0
"In this paper we describe an extension of the Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) which integrates the basic VNS with other complementary approaches from machine learning, statistics and experimental algorithmic, in order to produce high-quality performance and to completely automate the resulting optimization strategy. The resulting intelligent VNS has been successfully applied to a couple of optimization problems where the solution space consists of the subsets of a finite reference set. These problems are the labelled spanning tree and forest problems that are formulated on an undirected labelled graph; a graph where each edge has a label in a finite set of labels L. The problems consist on selecting the subset of labels such that the subgraph generated by these labels has an optimal spanning tree or forest, respectively. These problems have several applications in the real-world, where one aims to ensure connectivity by means of homogeneous connections.",0
"We propose an online form of the cake cutting problem. This models situations where agents arrive and depart during the process of dividing a resource. We show that well known fair division procedures like cut-and-choose and the Dubins-Spanier moving knife procedure can be adapted to apply to such online problems. We propose some fairness properties that online cake cutting procedures can possess like online forms of proportionality and envy-freeness. We also consider the impact of collusion between agents. Finally, we study theoretically and empirically the competitive ratio of these online cake cutting procedures. Based on its resistance to collusion, and its good performance in practice, our results favour the online version of the cut-and-choose procedure over the online version of the moving knife procedure.",0
"Zero-sum stochastic games provide a rich model for competitive decision making. However, under general forms of state uncertainty as considered in the Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG), such decision making problems are still not very well understood. This paper makes a contribution to the theory of zero-sum POSGs by characterizing structure in their value function. In particular, we introduce a new formulation of the value function for zs-POSGs as a function of the ""plan-time sufficient statistics"" (roughly speaking the information distribution in the POSG), which has the potential to enable generalization over such information distributions. We further delineate this generalization capability by proving a structural result on the shape of value function: it exhibits concavity and convexity with respect to appropriately chosen marginals of the statistic space. This result is a key pre-cursor for developing solution methods that may be able to exploit such structure. Finally, we show how these results allow us to reduce a zs-POSG to a ""centralized"" model with shared observations, thereby transferring results for the latter, narrower class, to games with individual (private) observations.",0
"In this paper we propose an architecture for specifying the interaction of non-player characters (NPCs) in the game-world in a way that abstracts common tasks in four main conceptual components, namely perception, deliberation, control, action. We argue that this architecture, inspired by AI research on autonomous agents and robots, can offer a number of benefits in the form of abstraction, modularity, re-usability and higher degrees of personalization for the behavior of each NPC. We also show how this architecture can be used to tackle a simple scenario related to the navigation of NPCs under incomplete information about the obstacles that may obstruct the various way-points in the game, in a simple and effective way.",0
"Unification in Description Logics has been introduced as a means to detect redundancies in ontologies. We try to extend the known decidability results for unification in the Description Logic $\mathcal{EL}$ to disunification since negative constraints can be used to avoid unwanted unifiers. While decidability of the solvability of general $\mathcal{EL}$-disunification problems remains an open problem, we obtain NP-completeness results for two interesting special cases: dismatching problems, where one side of each negative constraint must be ground, and local solvability of disunification problems, where we consider only solutions that are constructed from terms occurring in the input problem. More precisely, we first show that dismatching can be reduced to local disunification, and then provide two complementary NP-algorithms for finding local solutions of disunification problems.",0
"For most reinforcement learning approaches, the learning is performed by maximizing an accumulative reward that is expectedly and manually defined for specific tasks. However, in real world, rewards are emergent phenomena from the complex interactions between agents and environments. In this paper, we propose an implicit generic reward model for reinforcement learning. Unlike those rewards that are manually defined for specific tasks, such implicit reward is task independent. It only comes from the deviation from the agents' previous experiences.",0
"We study mechanisms for candidate selection that seek to minimize the social cost, where voters and candidates are associated with points in some underlying metric space. The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to each voter. Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on a real line, but other results of ours are more general.",0
"Mutation is one of the most important stages of the genetic algorithm because of its impact on the exploration of global optima, and to overcome premature convergence. There are many types of mutation, and the problem lies in selection of the appropriate type, where the decision becomes more difficult and needs more trial and error. This paper investigates the use of more than one mutation operator to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms. Novel mutation operators are proposed, in addition to two selection strategies for the mutation operators, one of which is based on selecting the best mutation operator and the other randomly selects any operator. Several experiments on some Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP) were conducted to evaluate the proposed methods, and these were compared to the well-known exchange mutation and rearrangement mutation. The results show the importance of some of the proposed methods, in addition to the significant enhancement of the genetic algorithm's performance, particularly when using more than one mutation operator.",0

"Existing research in crowdsourcing has investigated how to recommend tasks to workers based on which task the workers have already completed, referred to as {\em implicit feedback}. We, on the other hand, investigate the task recommendation problem, where we leverage both implicit feedback and explicit features of the task. We assume that we are given a set of workers, a set of tasks, interactions (such as the number of times a worker has completed a particular task), and the presence of explicit features of each task (such as, task location). We intend to recommend tasks to the workers by exploiting the implicit interactions, and the presence or absence of explicit features in the tasks. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem, propose two alternative problem formulations and respective solutions that exploit implicit feedback, explicit features, as well as similarity between the tasks. We compare the efficacy of our proposed solutions against multiple state-of-the-art techniques using two large scale real world datasets.",0
"We develop multiattribute auctions that accommodate generalized additive independent (GAI) preferences. We propose an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on potentially overlapping GAI clusters of attributes, thus decreases elicitation and computational burden, and creates an open competition among suppliers over a multidimensional domain. Most significantly, the auction is guaranteed to achieve surplus which approximates optimal welfare up to a small additive factor, under reasonable equilibrium strategies of traders. The main departure of GAI auctions from previous literature is to accommodate non-additive trader preferences, hence allowing traders to condition their evaluation of specific attributes on the value of other attributes. At the same time, the GAI structure supports a compact representation of prices, enabling a tractable auction process. We perform a simulation study, demonstrating and quantifying the significant efficiency advantage of more expressive preference modeling. We draw random GAI-structured utility functions with various internal structures, generate additive functions that approximate the GAI utility, and compare the performance of the auctions using the two representations. We find that allowing traders to express existing dependencies among attributes improves the economic efficiency of multiattribute auctions.",0
"Uncertainty plays a central role in spoken dialogue systems. Some stochastic models like Markov decision process (MDP) are used to model the dialogue manager. But the partially observable system state and user intention hinder the natural representation of the dialogue state. MDP-based system degrades fast when uncertainty about a user's intention increases. We propose a novel dialogue model based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We use hidden system states and user intentions as the state set, parser results and low-level information as the observation set, domain actions and dialogue repair actions as the action set. Here the low-level information is extracted from different input modals, including speech, keyboard, mouse, etc., using Bayesian networks. Because of the limitation of the exact algorithms, we focus on heuristic approximation algorithms and their applicability in POMDP for dialogue management. We also propose two methods for grid point selection in grid-based approximation algorithms.",0
"We consider the task of evaluating a policy for a Markov decision process (MDP). The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy the policy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected from deploying a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be used to produce unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standard technique. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy --- the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. We present a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performance estimates.",1
"Despite the current interest in Open Data publishing, a formal and comprehensive methodology supporting an organization in deciding which data to publish and carrying out precise procedures for publishing high-quality data, is still missing. In this paper we argue that the Ontology-based Data Management paradigm can provide a formal basis for a principled approach to publish high quality, semantically annotated Open Data. We describe two main approaches to using an ontology for this endeavor, and then we present some technical results on one of the approaches, called bottom-up, where the specification of the data to be published is given in terms of the sources, and specific techniques allow deriving suitable annotations for interpreting the published data under the light of the ontology.",0
"A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.",0
"The paper presents a suspicious email detection model which incorporates enhanced feature selection. In the paper we proposed the use of feature selection strategies along with classification technique for terrorists email detection. The presented model focuses on the evaluation of machine learning algorithms such as decision tree (ID3), logistic regression, Na\""ive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting emails containing suspicious content. In the literature, various algorithms achieved good accuracy for the desired task. However, the results achieved by those algorithms can be further improved by using appropriate feature selection mechanisms. We have identified the use of a specific feature selection scheme that improves the performance of the existing algorithms.",0
"We consider planning with uncertainty in the initial state as a case study of incremental quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solving. We report on experiments with a workflow to incrementally encode a planning instance into a sequence of QBFs. To solve this sequence of incrementally constructed QBFs, we use our general-purpose incremental QBF solver DepQBF. Since the generated QBFs have many clauses and variables in common, our approach avoids redundancy both in the encoding phase and in the solving phase. Experimental results show that incremental QBF solving outperforms non-incremental QBF solving. Our results are the first empirical study of incremental QBF solving in the context of planning. Based on our case study, we argue that incremental QBF solving also has the potential to improve QBF-based workflows in other application domains.",0
"POMDPs are a useful model for decision making in systems with uncertain states. One of the core tasks in a POMDP is the monitoring task, in which the belief state (i.e. the probability distribution over system states) is updated based on incomplete and noisy observations. This can be a hard problem in complex real-world systems due to the often very large state space. In this paper, we explore the idea of accelerating the monitoring task by automatically exploiting causality in the system. We consider a specific type of causal relation, called passivity, which pertains to how system variables cause changes in other variables. We present a novel monitoring method, called Passivity-based Monitoring (PM), which maintains a factored belief state representation and exploits passivity to perform selective updates over the factored beliefs. PM produces exact belief states under certain assumptions and approximate belief states otherwise, where the approximation error is bounded by the degree of uncertainty in the process. We show empirically, in synthetic processes with varying sizes and degrees of passivity, that PM is faster than two standard monitoring methods while achieving competitive accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how passivity occurs naturally in a real-world system such as a multi-robot warehouse, and how PM can exploit this to accelerate the monitoring task.",0
"In this paper we introduce temporal action graph games (TAGGs), a novel graphical representation of imperfect-information extensive form games. We show that when a game involves anonymity or context-specific utility independencies, its encoding as a TAGG can be much more compact than its direct encoding as a multiagent influence diagram (MAID).We also show that TAGGs can be understood as indirect MAID encodings in which many deterministic chance nodes are introduced. We provide an algorithm for computing with TAGGs, and show both theoretically and empirically that our approach improves significantly on the previous state of the art.",0
"We consider elections where the voters come one at a time, in a streaming fashion, and devise space-efficient algorithms which identify an approximate winning committee with respect to common multiwinner proportional representation voting rules; specifically, we consider the Approval-based and the Borda-based variants of both the Chamberlin-- ourant rule and the Monroe rule. We complement our algorithms with lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our results imply that, using space which does not depend on the number of voters it is possible to efficiently identify an approximate representative committee of fixed size over vote streams with huge number of voters.",0
"Understanding the behaviour of heuristic search methods is a challenge. This even holds for simple local search methods such as 2-OPT for the Traveling Salesperson problem. In this paper, we present a general framework that is able to construct a diverse set of instances that are hard or easy for a given search heuristic. Such a diverse set is obtained by using an evolutionary algorithm for constructing hard or easy instances that are diverse with respect to different features of the underlying problem. Examining the constructed instance sets, we show that many combinations of two or three features give a good classification of the TSP instances in terms of whether they are hard to be solved by 2-OPT.",0
"It is well-known that neural networks are computationally hard to train. On the other hand, in practice, modern day neural networks are trained efficiently using SGD and a variety of tricks that include different activation functions (e.g. ReLU), over-specification (i.e., train networks which are larger than needed), and regularization. In this paper we revisit the computational complexity of training neural networks from a modern perspective. We provide both positive and negative results, some of them yield new provably efficient and practical algorithms for training certain types of neural networks.",1
"This paper addresses the problem of planning under uncertainty in large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Factored MDPs represent a complex state space using state variables and the transition model using a dynamic Bayesian network. This representation often allows an exponential reduction in the representation size of structured MDPs, but the complexity of exact solution algorithms for such MDPs can grow exponentially in the representation size. In this paper, we present two approximate solution algorithms that exploit structure in factored MDPs. Both use an approximate value function represented as a linear combination of basis functions, where each basis function involves only a small subset of the domain variables. A key contribution of this paper is that it shows how the basic operations of both algorithms can be performed efficiently in closed form, by exploiting both additive and context-specific structure in a factored MDP. A central element of our algorithms is a novel linear program decomposition technique, analogous to variable elimination in Bayesian networks, which reduces an exponentially large LP to a provably equivalent, polynomial-sized one. One algorithm uses approximate linear programming, and the second approximate dynamic programming. Our dynamic programming algorithm is novel in that it uses an approximation based on max-norm, a technique that more directly minimizes the terms that appear in error bounds for approximate MDP algorithms. We provide experimental results on problems with over 10^40 states, demonstrating a promising indication of the scalability of our approach, and compare our algorithm to an existing state-of-the-art approach, showing, in some problems, exponential gains in computation time.",0
"A mesoscopic approach to modeling pedestrian simulation with multiple exits is proposed in this paper. A floor field based on Qlearning Algorithm is used. Attractiveness of exits to pedestrian typically is based on shortest path. However, several factors may influence pedestrian choice of exits. Scenarios with multiple exits are presented and effect of Q-learning rewards system on navigation is investigated",0
Quantum decision systems are being increasingly considered for use in artificial intelligence applications. Classical and quantum nodes can be distinguished based on certain correlations in their states. This paper investigates some properties of the states obtained in a decision tree structure. How these correlations may be mapped to the decision tree is considered. Classical tree representations and approximations to quantum states are provided.,0
"Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is a novel paradigm facilitating access to relational data, realized by linking data sources to an ontology by means of declarative mappings. DL-Lite_R, the current language of choice for OBDA, has been designed with the goal of delegating query answering to the underlying database engine, and thus is restricted in expressive power. E.g., it does not allow one to express disjunctive information, and any form of recursion on the data. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations of DL-Lite_R, and extend OBDA to more expressive ontology languages, while still leveraging the underlying relational technology for query answering. We achieve this by relying on two well-known mechanisms, namely conservative rewriting and approximation, but significantly extend their practical impact by bringing into the picture the mapping, an essential component of OBDA. Specifically, we develop techniques to rewrite OBDA specifications with an expressive ontology to ""equivalent"" ones with a DL-Lite_R ontology, if possible, and to approximate them otherwise. We do so by exploiting the high expressive power of the mapping layer to capture part of the domain semantics of rich ontology languages. We have implemented our techniques making use of a state-of-the-art OBDA system, and we have shown their feasibility and effectiveness with experiments on synthetic and real-world data.",0
"Typical approaches to plan recognition start from a representation of an agent's possible plans, and reason evidentially from observations of the agent's actions to assess the plausibility of the various candidates. A more expansive view of the task (consistent with some prior work) accounts for the context in which the plan was generated, the mental state and planning process of the agent, and consequences of the agent's actions in the world. We present a general Bayesian framework encompassing this view, and focus on how context can be exploited in plan recognition. We demonstrate the approach on a problem in traffic monitoring, where the objective is to induce the plan of the driver from observation of vehicle movements. Starting from a model of how the driver generates plans, we show how the highway context can appropriately influence the recognizer's interpretation of observed driver behavior.",0
"We extend the knowledge about so-called structural restrictions of $\mathrm{\#SAT}$ by giving a polynomial time algorithm for $\beta$-acyclic $\mathrm{\#SAT}$. In contrast to previous algorithms in the area, our algorithm does not proceed by dynamic programming but works along an elimination order, solving a weighted version of constraint satisfaction. Moreover, we give evidence that this deviation from more standard algorithm is not a coincidence, but that there is likely no dynamic programming algorithm of the usual style for $\beta$-acyclic $\mathrm{\#SAT}$.",0
"Imaging is a form of probabilistic belief change which could be employed for both revision and update. In this paper, we propose a new framework for probabilistic belief change based on imaging, called Expected Distance Imaging (EDI). EDI is sufficiently general to define Bayesian conditioning and other forms of imaging previously defined in the literature. We argue that, and investigate how, EDI can be used for both revision and update. EDI's definition depends crucially on a weight function whose properties are studied and whose effect on belief change operations is analysed. Finally, four EDI instantiations are proposed, two for revision and two for update, and probabilistic rationality postulates are suggested for their analysis.",0
"One of the most significant problems which inhibits further developments in the areas of Knowledge Representation and Artificial Intelligence is a problem of semantic alignment or knowledge mapping. The progress in its solution will be greatly beneficial for further advances of information retrieval, ontology alignment, relevance calculation, text mining, natural language processing etc. In the paper the concept of multidimensional global knowledge map, elaborated through unsupervised extraction of dependencies from large documents corpus, is proposed. In addition, the problem of direct Human - Knowledge Representation System interface is addressed and a concept of adaptive decoder proposed for the purpose of interaction with previously described unified mapping model. In combination these two approaches are suggested as basis for a development of a new generation of knowledge representation systems.",0
"We propose a logic of asynchronous announcements, where truthful announcements are publicly sent but individually received by agents. Additional to epistemic modalities, the logic therefore contains two types of dynamic modalities, for sending messages and for receiving messages. The semantics defines truth relative to the current state of reception of messages for all agents. This means that knowledge need not be truthful, because some messages may not have been received by the knowing agent. Messages that are announcements may also result in partial synchronization, namely when an agent learns from receiving an announcement that other announcements must already have been received by other agents. We give detailed examples of the semantics, and prove several semantic results, including that: after an announcement an agent knows that a proposition is true, if and only if on condition of the truth of that announcement, the agent knows that after that announcement and after any number of other agents also receiving it, the proposition is true. We show that on multi-agent epistemic models, each formula in asynchronous announcement logic is equivalent to a formula in epistemic logic.",0
"Operating vehicles in adversarial environments between a recurring origin-destination pair requires new planning techniques. A two players zero-sum game is introduced. The goal of the first player is to minimize the expected casualties undergone by a convoy. The goal of the second player is to maximize this damage. The outcome of the game is obtained via a linear program that solves the corresponding minmax optimization problem over this outcome. Different environment models are defined in order to compute routing strategies over unstructured environments. To compare these methods for increasingly accurate representations of the environment, a grid-based model is chosen to represent the environment and the existence of a sufficient network size is highlighted. A global framework for the generation of realistic routing strategies between any two points is described. This framework requires a good assessment of the potential casualties at any location, therefore the most important parameters are identified. Finally the framework is tested on real world environments.",0
"This paper presents an approach to expert-guided subgroup discovery. The main step of the subgroup discovery process, the induction of subgroup descriptions, is performed by a heuristic beam search algorithm, using a novel parametrized definition of rule quality which is analyzed in detail. The other important steps of the proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of statistically significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup visualization: statistically significant properties are used to enrich the descriptions of induced subgroups, while the visualization shows subgroup properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of examples in the subgroups. The approach is illustrated by the results obtained for a medical problem of early detection of patient risk groups.",0
"Deep neural networks are able to solve tasks across a variety of domains and modalities of data. Despite many empirical successes, we lack the ability to clearly understand and interpret the learned internal mechanisms that contribute to such effective behaviors or, more critically, failure modes. In this work, we present a general method for visualizing an arbitrary neural network's inner mechanisms and their power and limitations. Our dataset-centric method produces visualizations of how a trained network attends to components of its inputs. The computed ""attention masks"" support improved interpretability by highlighting which input attributes are critical in determining output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a variety of deep neural network architectures in domains from computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. The primary contribution of our approach is an interpretable visualization of attention that provides unique insights into the network's underlying decision-making process irrespective of the data modality.",0
"In this paper we study different concepts of independence for convex sets of probabilities. There will be two basic ideas for independence. The first is irrelevance. Two variables are independent when a change on the knowledge about one variable does not affect the other. The second one is factorization. Two variables are independent when the joint convex set of probabilities can be decomposed on the product of marginal convex sets. In the case of the Theory of Probability, these two starting points give rise to the same definition. In the case of convex sets of probabilities, the resulting concepts will be strongly related, but they will not be equivalent. As application of the concept of independence, we shall consider the problem of building a global convex set from marginal convex sets of probabilities.",0
"Constraints that may be obtained by composition from simpler constraints are present, in some way or another, in almost every constraint program. The decomposition of such constraints is a standard technique for obtaining an adequate propagation algorithm from a combination of propagators designed for simpler constraints. The decomposition approach is appealing in several ways. Firstly because creating a specific propagator for every constraint is clearly infeasible since the number of constraints is infinite. Secondly, because designing a propagation algorithm for complex constraints can be very challenging. Finally, reusing existing propagators allows to reduce the size of code to be developed and maintained. Traditionally, constraint solvers automatically decompose constraints into simpler ones using additional auxiliary variables and propagators, or expect the users to perform such decomposition themselves, eventually leading to the same propagation model. In this paper we explore views, an alternative way to create efficient propagators for such constraints in a modular, simple and correct way, which avoids the introduction of auxiliary variables and propagators.",0
"Software project estimation is crucial aspect in delivering software on time and on budget. Software size is an important metric in determining the effort, cost, and productivity. Today, source lines of code and function point are the most used sizing metrics. Backfiring is a well-known technique for converting between function points and source lines of code. However when backfiring is used, there is a high margin of error. This study introduces a method to improve the accuracy of backfiring. Intelligent systems have been used in software prediction models to improve performance over traditional techniques. For this reason, a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy is used because it takes advantages of the neural networks learning and fuzzy logic human-like reasoning. This paper describes an improved backfiring technique which uses Neuro-Fuzzy and compares the new method against the default conversion ratios currently used by software practitioners.",0
"Statistical relational models provide compact encodings of probabilistic dependencies in relational domains, but result in highly intractable graphical models. The goal of lifted inference is to carry out probabilistic inference without needing to reason about each individual separately, by instead treating exchangeable, undistinguished objects as a whole. In this paper, we study the domain recursion inference rule, which, despite its central role in early theoretical results on domain-lifted inference, has later been believed redundant. We show that this rule is more powerful than expected, and in fact significantly extends the range of models for which lifted inference runs in time polynomial in the number of individuals in the domain. This includes an open problem called S4, the symmetric transitivity model, and a first-order logic encoding of the birthday paradox. We further identify new classes S2FO2 and S2RU of domain-liftable theories, which respectively subsume FO2 and recursively unary theories, the largest classes of domain-liftable theories known so far, and show that using domain recursion can achieve exponential speedup even in theories that cannot fully be lifted with the existing set of inference rules.",1
"In this paper, we consider the decision-theoretic framework for online learning (DTOL) proposed by Freund and Schapire \cite{FS97}. Previous algorithms for learning in this framework have a tunable learning rate parameter. Tuning the learning rate requires prior knowledge about the sequence and severely limits the practicality of the algorithm. While much progress has been made in the past decade for adaptively tuning the learning rate, all of these methods still ultimately rely on some prior information. We propose a completely parameter-free algorithm for learning in this framework. We show theoretically that our algorithm has a regret bound similar to the best bounds achieved by previous algorithms with optimally-tuned learning rates. We also present a few experiments comparing the performance of the algorithm with that of other algorithms for various tunings.",1
"Most algorithms for solving POMDPs iteratively improve a value function that implicitly represents a policy and are said to search in value function space. This paper presents an approach to solving POMDPs that represents a policy explicitly as a finite-state controller and iteratively improves the controller by search in policy space. Two related algorithms illustrate this approach. The first is a policy iteration algorithm that can outperform value iteration in solving infinitehorizon POMDPs. It provides the foundation for a new heuristic search algorithm that promises further speedup by focusing computational effort on regions of the problem space that are reachable, or likely to be reached, from a start state.",0
"We propose a novel embedding model that represents relationships among several elements in bibliographic information with high representation ability and flexibility. Based on this model, we present a novel search system that shows the relationships among the elements in the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. The evaluation results show that our model can achieve a high prediction ability and produce reasonable search results.",0
"Knowledge compilation is an approach to tackle the computational intractability of general reasoning problems. According to this approach, knowledge bases are converted off-line into a target compilation language which is tractable for on-line querying. Reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) is one of the most influential target languages. We generalize ROBDD by associating some implied literals in each node and the new language is called reduced ordered binary decision diagram with implied literals (ROBDD-L). Then we discuss a kind of subsets of ROBDD-L called ROBDD-i with precisely i implied literals (0 \leq i \leq \infty). In particular, ROBDD-0 is isomorphic to ROBDD; ROBDD-\infty requires that each node should be associated by the implied literals as many as possible. We show that ROBDD-i has uniqueness over some specific variables order, and ROBDD-\infty is the most succinct subset in ROBDD-L and can meet most of the querying requirements involved in the knowledge compilation map. Finally, we propose an ROBDD-i compilation algorithm for any i and a ROBDD-\infty compilation algorithm. Based on them, we implement a ROBDD-L package called BDDjLu and then get some conclusions from preliminary experimental results: ROBDD-\infty is obviously smaller than ROBDD for all benchmarks; ROBDD-\infty is smaller than the d-DNNF the benchmarks whose compilation results are relatively small; it seems that it is better to transform ROBDDs-\infty into FBDDs and ROBDDs rather than straight compile the benchmarks.",0
"Simple conceptual graphs are considered as the kernel of most knowledge representation formalisms built upon Sowa's model. Reasoning in this model can be expressed by a graph homomorphism called projection, whose semantics is usually given in terms of positive, conjunctive, existential FOL. We present here a family of extensions of this model, based on rules and constraints, keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation. We focus on the formal definitions of the different models obtained, including their operational semantics and relationships with FOL, and we analyze the decidability and complexity of the associated problems (consistency and deduction). As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, these problems are not decidable, but we exhibit a condition under which they fall in the polynomial hierarchy. These results extend and complete the ones already published by the authors. Moreover we systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained by restricting the form of constraints and/or rules.",0
"We aim to enable robot to learn tabletop object manipulation by imitation. Given external observations of demonstrations on object manipulations, we believe that two underlying problems to address in learning by imitation is 1) segment a given demonstration into skills that can be individually learned and reused, and 2) formulate the correct RL (Reinforcement Learning) problem that only considers the relevant aspects of each skill so that the policy for each skill can be effectively learned. Previous works made certain progress in this direction, but none has taken private information into account. The public information is the information that is available in the external observations of demonstration, and the private information is the information that are only available to the agent that executes the actions, such as tactile sensations. Our contribution is that we provide a method for the robot to automatically segment the demonstration into multiple skills, and formulate the correct RL problem for each skill, and automatically decide whether the private information is an important aspect of each skill based on interaction with the world. Our motivating example is for a real robot to play the shape sorter game by imitating other's behavior, and we will show the results in a simulated 2D environment that captures the important properties of the shape sorter game. The evaluation is based on whether the demonstration is reasonably segmented, and whether the correct RL problems are formulated. In the end, we will show that robot can imitate the demonstrated behavior based on learned policies.",0
"Expectation for the emergence of higher functions is getting larger in the framework of end-to-end reinforcement learning using a recurrent neural network. However, the emergence of ""thinking"" that is a typical higher function is difficult to realize because ""thinking"" needs non fixed-point, flow-type attractors with both convergence and transition dynamics. Furthermore, in order to introduce ""inspiration"" or ""discovery"" in ""thinking"", not completely random but unexpected transition should be also required.",0
"Given the large number of new musical tracks released each year, automated approaches to plagiarism detection are essential to help us track potential violations of copyright. Most current approaches to plagiarism detection are based on musical similarity measures, which typically ignore the issue of polyphony in music. We present a novel feature space for audio derived from compositional modelling techniques, commonly used in signal separation, that provides a mechanism to account for polyphony without incurring an inordinate amount of computational overhead. We employ this feature representation in conjunction with traditional audio feature representations in a classification framework which uses an ensemble of distance features to characterize pairs of songs as being plagiarized or not. Our experiments on a database of about 3000 musical track pairs show that the new feature space characterization produces significant improvements over standard baselines.",0
"Originating from Allen's Interval Algebra, composition-based reasoning has been widely acknowledged as the most popular reasoning technique in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. Given a qualitative calculus (i.e. a relation model), the first thing we should do is to establish its composition table (CT). In the past three decades, such work is usually done manually. This is undesirable and error-prone, given that the calculus may contain tens or hundreds of basic relations. Computing the correct CT has been identified by Tony Cohn as a challenge for computer scientists in 1995. This paper addresses this problem and introduces a semi-automatic method to compute the CT by randomly generating triples of elements. For several important qualitative calculi, our method can establish the correct CT in a reasonable short time. This is illustrated by applications to the Interval Algebra, the Region Connection Calculus RCC-8, the INDU calculus, and the Oriented Point Relation Algebras. Our method can also be used to generate CTs for customised qualitative calculi defined on restricted domains.",0
"In this paper, we investigate the hybrid tractability of binary Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSPs). First, a basic tractable class of binary QCSPs is identified by using the broken-triangle property. In this class, the variable ordering for the broken-triangle property must be same as that in the prefix of the QCSP. Second, we break this restriction to allow that existentially quantified variables can be shifted within or out of their blocks, and thus identify some novel tractable classes by introducing the broken-angle property. Finally, we identify a more generalized tractable class, i.e., the min-of-max extendable class for QCSPs.",1
"We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to $k$ sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator. At each time-step $t$, one of the $k$ site nodes has to pick an expert from the set ${1, ..., n}$, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon $T$, while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum.",1
"We present a novel reasoning calculus for the description logic SHOIQ^+---a knowledge representation formalism with applications in areas such as the Semantic Web. Unnecessary nondeterminism and the construction of large models are two primary sources of inefficiency in the tableau-based reasoning calculi used in state-of-the-art reasoners. In order to reduce nondeterminism, we base our calculus on hypertableau and hyperresolution calculi, which we extend with a blocking condition to ensure termination. In order to reduce the size of the constructed models, we introduce anywhere pairwise blocking. We also present an improved nominal introduction rule that ensures termination in the presence of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions---a combination of DL constructs that has proven notoriously difficult to handle. Our implementation shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art reasoners on several well-known ontologies.",0
We present a new social animal inspired emotional swarm intelligence technique. This technique is used to solve a variant of the popular collective robots problem called foraging. We show with a simulation study how simple interaction rules based on sensations like hunger and loneliness can lead to globally coherent emergent behavior which allows sensor constrained robots to solve the given problem,0
"Pertinence Feedback is a technique that enables a user to interactively express his information requirement by modifying his original query formulation with further information. This information is provided by explicitly confirming the pertinent of some indicating objects and/or goals extracted by the system. Obviously the user cannot mark objects and/or goals as pertinent until some are extracted, so the first search has to be initiated by a query and the initial query specification has to be good enough to pick out some pertinent objects and/or goals from the Semantic Network. In this paper we present a short survey of fuzzy and Semantic approaches to Knowledge Extraction. The goal of such approaches is to define flexible Knowledge Extraction Systems able to deal with the inherent vagueness and uncertainty of the Extraction process. It has long been recognised that interactivity improves the effectiveness of Knowledge Extraction systems. Novice user's queries are the most natural and interactive medium of communication and recent progress in recognition is making it possible to build systems that interact with the user. However, given the typical novice user's queries submitted to Knowledge Extraction Systems, it is easy to imagine that the effects of goal recognition errors in novice user's queries must be severely destructive on the system's effectiveness. The experimental work reported in this paper shows that the use of possibility theory in classical Knowledge Extraction techniques for novice user's query processing is more robust than the use of the probability theory. Moreover, both possibilistic and probabilistic pertinence feedback can be effectively employed to improve the effectiveness of novice user's query processing.",0
"A fundamental question is whether Turing machines can model all reasoning processes. We introduce an existence principle stating that the perception of the physical existence of any Turing program can serve as a physical causation for the application of any Turing-computable function to this Turing program. The existence principle overcomes the limitation of the outputs of Turing machines to lists, that is, recursively enumerable sets. The principle is illustrated by productive partial functions for productive sets such as the set of the Goedel numbers of the Turing-computable total functions. The existence principle and productive functions imply the existence of physical systems whose reasoning processes cannot be modeled by Turing machines. These systems are called creative. Creative systems can prove the undecidable formula in Goedel's theorem in another formal system which is constructed at a later point in time. A hypothesis about creative systems, which is based on computer experiments, is introduced.",0
"It has been widely known that performance of algorithms for NP-Hard problems varies from instance to instance. This phenomenon has been observed, when we comprehensively studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on a six benchmark instances of discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP). Instead of using single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. In this paper, we proposed portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA 2), the strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA 2), Pareto archive evolutionary strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2 (NPGA 2) to solve DTCTP. The result shows that the portfolio approach is computationally fast and qualitatively superior than its constituent algorithms for all benchmark instances. Moreover, portfolio approach provides an insight in selecting the best algorithm for all instances of DTCTP.",0
"This paper presents a sociocultural knowledge ontology (OntoSOC) modeling approach. OntoSOC modeling approach is based on Engestrom Human Activity Theory (HAT). That Theory allowed us to identify fundamental concepts and relationships between them. The top-down precess has been used to define differents sub-concepts. The modeled vocabulary permits us to organise data, to facilitate information retrieval by introducing a semantic layer in social web platform architecture, we project to implement. This platform can be considered as a collective memory and Participative and Distributed Information System (PDIS) which will allow Cameroonian communities to share an co-construct knowledge on permanent organized activities.",0
"In this paper, we focus on learning structure-aware document representations from data without recourse to a discourse parser or additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from recent efforts to empower neural networks with a structural bias, we propose a model that can encode a document while automatically inducing rich structural dependencies. Specifically, we embed a differentiable non-projective parsing algorithm into a neural model and use attention mechanisms to incorporate the structural biases. Experimental evaluation across different tasks and datasets shows that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on document modeling tasks while inducing intermediate structures which are both interpretable and meaningful.",0
"We use princiles of fuzzy logic to develop a general model representing several processes in a system's operation characterized by a degree of vagueness and/or uncertainy. Further, we introduce three altenative measures of a fuzzy system's effectiveness connected to the above model. An applcation is also developed for the Mathematical Modelling process illustrating our results.",0
"In this work we present a method for using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in multi-objective tasks. Deep Q-Networks provide remarkable performance in single objective tasks learning from high-level visual perception. However, in many scenarios (e.g in robotics), the agent needs to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously. We propose an architecture in which separate DQNs are used to control the agent's behaviour with respect to particular objectives. In this architecture we use signal suppression, known from the (Brooks) subsumption architecture, to combine outputs of several DQNs into a single action. Our architecture enables the decomposition of the agent's behaviour into controllable and replaceable sub-behaviours learned by distinct modules. To evaluate our solution we used a game-like simulator in which an agent - provided with high-level visual input - pursues multiple objectives in a 2D world. Our solution provides benefits of modularity, while its performance is comparable to the monolithic approach.",0
"The aim of this paper is to present a method for identifying the structure of a rule in a fuzzy model. For this purpose, an ATMS shall be used (Zurita 1994). An algorithm obtaining the identification of the structure will be suggested (Castro 1995). The minimal structure of the rule (with respect to the number of variables that must appear in the rule) will be found by this algorithm. Furthermore, the identification parameters shall be obtained simultaneously. The proposed method shall be applied for classification to an example. The {em Iris Plant Database} shall be learnt for all three kinds of plants.",0
"In a content based image classification system, target images are sorted by feature similarities with respect to the query (CBIR). In this paper, we propose to use new approach combining distance tangent, k-means algorithm and Bayesian network for image classification. First, we use the technique of tangent distance to calculate several tangent spaces representing the same image. The objective is to reduce the error in the classification phase. Second, we cut the image in a whole of blocks. For each block, we compute a vector of descriptors. Then, we use K-means to cluster the low-level features including color and texture information to build a vector of labels for each image. Finally, we apply five variants of Bayesian networks classifiers (Na\""ive Bayes, Global Tree Augmented Na\""ive Bayes (GTAN), Global Forest Augmented Na\""ive Bayes (GFAN), Tree Augmented Na\""ive Bayes for each class (TAN), and Forest Augmented Na\""ive Bayes for each class (FAN) to classify the image of faces using the vector of labels. In order to validate the feasibility and effectively, we compare the results of GFAN to FAN and to the others classifiers (NB, GTAN, TAN). The results demonstrate FAN outperforms than GFAN, NB, GTAN and TAN in the overall classification accuracy.",0
"In this paper we provide a first analysis of the research questions that arise when dealing with the problem of communicating pieces of formal argumentation through natural language interfaces. It is a generally held opinion that formal models of argumentation naturally capture human argument, and some preliminary studies have focused on justifying this view. Unfortunately, the results are not only inconclusive, but seem to suggest that explaining formal argumentation to humans is a rather articulated task. Graphical models for expressing argumentation-based reasoning are appealing, but often humans require significant training to use these tools effectively. We claim that natural language interfaces to formal argumentation systems offer a real alternative, and may be the way forward for systems that capture human argument.",0
"Feature weighting algorithms try to solve a problem of great importance nowadays in machine learning: The search of a relevance measure for the features of a given domain. This relevance is primarily used for feature selection as feature weighting can be seen as a generalization of it, but it is also useful to better understand a problem's domain or to guide an inductor in its learning process. Relief family of algorithms are proven to be very effective in this task.",0
"Conceptual blending is a powerful tool for computational creativity where, for example, the properties of two harmonic spaces may be combined in a consistent manner to produce a novel harmonic space. However, deciding about the importance of property features in the input spaces and evaluating the results of conceptual blending is a nontrivial task. In the specific case of musical harmony, defining the salient features of chord transitions and evaluating invented harmonic spaces requires deep musicological background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a creative tool that helps musicologists to evaluate and to enhance harmonic innovation. This tool allows a music expert to specify arguments over given transition properties. These arguments are then considered by the system when defining combinations of features in an idiom-blending process. A music expert can assess whether the new harmonic idiom makes musicological sense and re-adjust the arguments (selection of features) to explore alternative blends that can potentially produce better harmonic spaces. We conclude with a discussion of future work that would further automate the harmonisation process.",0
"To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Building on the award-winning, portfolio-based ASP solver claspfolio, we present claspfolio 2, a modular and open solver architecture that integrates several different portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques. The claspfolio 2 solver framework supports various feature generators, solver selection approaches, solver portfolios, as well as solver-schedule-based pre-solving techniques. The default configuration of claspfolio 2 relies on a light-weight version of the ASP solver clasp to generate static and dynamic instance features. The flexible open design of claspfolio 2 is a distinguishing factor even beyond ASP. As such, it provides a unique framework for comparing and combining existing portfolio-based algorithm selection approaches and techniques in a single, unified framework. Taking advantage of this, we conducted an extensive experimental study to assess the impact of different feature sets, selection approaches and base solver portfolios. In addition to gaining substantial insights into the utility of the various approaches and techniques, we identified a default configuration of claspfolio 2 that achieves substantial performance gains not only over clasp's default configuration and the earlier version of claspfolio 2, but also over manually tuned configurations of clasp.",0
"Nowadays, huge efforts are made to modernize the air traffic management systems to cope with uncertainty, complexity and sub-optimality. An answer is to enhance the information sharing between the stakeholders. This paper introduces a framework that bridges the gap between air traffic management and air traffic control on the one hand, and bridges the gap between the ground, the approach and the en-route centers on the other hand. An original system is presented, that has three essential components: the trajectory models, the optimization process, and the monitoring process. The uncertainty of the trajectory is modeled with a Bayesian Network, where the nodes are associated to two types of random variables: the time of overflight on metering points of the airspace, and the traveling time of the routes linking these points. The resulting Bayesian Network covers the complete airspace, and Monte- Carlo simulations are done to estimate the probabilities of sector congestion and delays. On top of this trajectory model, an optimization process minimizes these probabilities by tuning the parameters of the Bayesian trajectory model related to overflight times on metering points. The last component is the monitoring process, that continuously updates the situation of the airspace, modifying the trajectories uncertainties according to actual positions of aircraft. After each update, a new optimal set of overflight times is computed, and can be communicated to the controllers as clearances for the aircraft pilots. The paper presents a formal specification of this global optimization problem, whose underlying rationale was derived with the help of air traffic controllers at Thales Air Systems.",0
"Representing symbolic knowledge into a connectionist network is the key element for the integration of scalable learning and sound reasoning. Most of the previous studies focus on discriminative neural networks which unnecessarily require a separation of input/output variables. Recent development of generative neural networks such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) has shown a capability of learning semantic abstractions directly from data, posing a promise for general symbolic learning and reasoning. Previous work on Penalty logic show a link between propositional logic and symmetric connectionist networks, however it is not applicable to RBMs. This paper proposes a novel method to represent propositional formulas into RBMs/stack of RBMs where Gibbs sampling can be seen as MaxSAT. It also shows a promising use of RBMs to learn symbolic knowledge through maximum likelihood estimation.",0
"\emph{Canonical (logic) programs} (CP) refer to normal logic programs augmented with connective $not\ not$. In this paper we address the question of whether CP are \emph{succinctly incomparable} with \emph{propositional formulas} (PF). Our main result shows that the PARITY problem, which can be polynomially represented in PF but \emph{only} has exponential representations in CP. In other words, PARITY \emph{separates} PF from CP. Simply speaking, this means that exponential size blowup is generally inevitable when translating a set of formulas in PF into an equivalent program in CP (without introducing new variables). Furthermore, since it has been shown by Lifschitz and Razborov that there is also a problem that separates CP from PF (assuming $\mathsf{P}\nsubseteq \mathsf{NC^1/poly}$), it follows that CP and PF are indeed succinctly incomparable. From the view of the theory of computation, the above result may also be considered as the separation of two \emph{models of computation}, i.e., we identify a language in $\mathsf{NC^1/poly}$ which is not in the set of languages computable by polynomial size CP programs.",0
"Reinforcement learning is a formal framework for modeling agents that learn to solve tasks. For example, one important task for animals is to navigate in an environment to find food or to return to their nest. In such tasks, the agent has to learn a path through the environment from start states to goal states, by visiting a sequence of intermediate states. The agent receives reward on a goal state. Concretely, we need to learn a policy that maps each encountered state to an immediate action that leads to a next state, eventually leading to a goal state. We say that a learning process has converged if eventually the policy will no longer change, i.e., the policy stabilizes. The intuition of paths and navigation policies can be applied generally. Indeed, in this article, we study navigation tasks formalized as a graph structure that, for each application of an action to a state, describes the possible successor states that could result from that application. In contrast to standard reinforcement learning, we essentially simplify numeric reward signals to boolean flags on the transitions in the graph. The resulting framework enables a clear theoretical study of how properties of the graph structure can cause convergence of the learning process. In particular, we formally study a learning process that detects revisits to states in the graph, i.e., we detect cycles, and the process keeps adjusting the policy until no more cycles are made. So, eventually, the agent goes straight to reward from each start state. We identify reducibility of the task graph as a sufficient condition for this learning process to converge. We also syntactically characterize the form of the final policy, which can be used to detect convergence in a simulation.",0
"Seven years on from OWL becoming a W3C recommendation, and two years on from the more recent OWL 2 W3C recommendation, OWL has still experienced only patchy uptake on the Web. Although certain OWL features (like owl:sameAs) are very popular, other features of OWL are largely neglected by publishers in the Linked Data world. This may suggest that despite the promise of easy implementations and the proposal of tractable profiles suggested in OWL's second version, there is still no ""right"" standard fragment for the Linked Data community. In this paper, we (1) analyse uptake of OWL on the Web of Data, (2) gain insights into the OWL fragment that is actually used/usable on the Web, where we arrive at the conclusion that this fragment is likely to be a simplified profile based on OWL RL, (3) propose and discuss such a new fragment, which we call OWL LD (for Linked Data).",0
"The rapid growth of emerging information technologies and application patterns in modern society, e.g., Internet, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Tri-network Convergence, has caused the advent of the era of big data. Big data contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a tremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency. Attribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as an effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to reduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for a single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the parallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data have to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become inefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum efficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale Attribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three components: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a decision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity representation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached in the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates all feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3) data-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel using a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative heuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various huge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's advantages beyond existing solutions.",0
"In this report, we will be interested at Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBNs) as a model that tries to incorporate temporal dimension with uncertainty.

"Description logic Knowledge and Action Bases (KAB) are a mechanism for providing both a semantically rich representation of the information on the domain of interest in terms of a description logic knowledge base and actions to change such information over time, possibly introducing new objects. We resort to a variant of DL-Lite where the unique name assumption is not enforced and where equality between objects may be asserted and inferred. Actions are specified as sets of conditional effects, where conditions are based on epistemic queries over the knowledge base (TBox and ABox), and effects are expressed in terms of new ABoxes. In this setting, we address verification of temporal properties expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus with quantification across states. Notably, we show decidability of verification, under a suitable restriction inspired by the notion of weak acyclicity in data exchange.",0
"LSTMs have become a basic building block for many deep NLP models. In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of architectural modifications for LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets. We observe compounding improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, deep vector averaging (DVA), and residual connections, along with four other suggested modifications. Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality baseline model.",0
"Integrating vision and language has long been a dream in work on artificial intelligence (AI). In the past two years, we have witnessed an explosion of work that brings together vision and language from images to videos and beyond. The available corpora have played a crucial role in advancing this area of research. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics for evaluating and analyzing the vision &amp; language datasets and classify them accordingly. Our analyses show that the most recent datasets have been using more complex language and more abstract concepts, however, there are different strengths and weaknesses in each.",1
"Word and phrase tables are key inputs to machine translations, but costly to produce. New unsupervised learning methods represent words and phrases in a high-dimensional vector space, and these monolingual embeddings have been shown to encode syntactic and semantic relationships between language elements. The information captured by these embeddings can be exploited for bilingual translation by learning a transformation matrix that allows to match relative positions across two monolingual vector spaces. This method aims to identify high-quality candidates for word and phrase translation more cost-effectively from unlabeled data. This paper expands the scope of previous attempts of bilingual translation to four languages (English, German, Spanish, and French). It shows how to process the source data, train a neural network to learn the high-dimensional embeddings for individual languages and expands the framework for testing their quality beyond the English language.. Furthermore, it shows how to learn bilingual transformation matrices and obtain candidates for word and phrase translation, and assess their quality.",0
"Discovering the key structure of a database is one of the main goals of data mining. In pattern set mining we do so by discovering a small set of patterns that together describe the data well. The richer the class of patterns we consider, and the more powerful our description language, the better we will be able to summarise the data. In this paper we propose \ourmethod, a novel greedy MDL-based method for summarising sequential data using rich patterns that are allowed to interleave. Experiments show \ourmethod is orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art, results in better models, as well as discovers meaningful semantics in the form patterns that identify multiple choices of values.",0
"Let us envision a new class of IT systems, the ""Support Systems for Knowledge Works"" or SSKW. An SSKW can be defined as a system built for providing comprehensive support to human knowledge-workers while performing instances of complex knowledge-works of a particular type within a particular domain of professional activities To get an idea what an SSKW-enabled work environment can be like, let us look into a hypothetical scenario that depicts the interaction between a physician and a patient-care SSKW during the activity of diagnosing a patient.",0
"Much of the user-generated content on social media is provided by ordinary people telling stories about their daily lives. We develop and test a novel method for learning fine-grained common-sense knowledge from these stories about contingent (causal and conditional) relationships between everyday events. This type of knowledge is useful for text and story understanding, information extraction, question answering, and text summarization. We test and compare different methods for learning contingency relation, and compare what is learned from topic-sorted story collections vs. general-domain stories. Our experiments show that using topic-specific datasets enables learning finer-grained knowledge about events and results in significant improvement over the baselines. An evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows 82% of the relations between events that we learn from topic-sorted stories are judged as contingent.",0
"In late 2011, Fado was elevated to the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO. This study aims to develop a tool for automatic detection of Fado music based on the audio signal. To do this, frequency spectrum-related characteristics were captured form the audio signal: in addition to the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and the energy of the signal, the signal was further analysed in two frequency ranges, providing additional information. Tests were run both in a 10-fold cross-validation setup (97.6% accuracy), and in a traditional train/test setup (95.8% accuracy). The good results reflect the fact that Fado is a very distinctive musical style.",0
"Image semantic segmentation is more and more being of interest for computer vision and machine learning researchers. Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.",0
"The process-based semantic composition of Web Services is gaining a considerable momentum as an approach for the effective integration of distributed, heterogeneous, and autonomous applications. To compose Web Services semantically, we need an ontology. There are several ways of inserting semantics in Web Services. One of them consists of using description languages like OWL-S. In this paper, we introduce our work which consists in the proposition of a new model and the use of semantic matching technology for semantic and dynamic composition of ebXML business processes.",0
"We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic role labeling. Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on states of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. The semantic role labeler achieves respectable performance on English even without any kind of syntactic information and only using local inference. However, when automatically predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially outperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results on the CoNLL-2009 dataset. Syntactic parsers are unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e. syntactically-informed) SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. Our syntax-agnostic model appears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on the standard out-of-domain test set.",0
"This paper presents an approach for learning to translate simple narratives, i.e., texts (sequences of sentences) describing dynamic systems, into coherent sequences of events without the need for labeled training data. Our approach incorporates domain knowledge in the form of preconditions and effects of events, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art supervised learning systems on the task of reconstructing RoboCup soccer games from their commentaries.",0
"Recent advances in the study of voting classification algorithms have brought empirical and theoretical results clearly showing the discrimination power of ensemble classifiers. It has been previously argued that the search of this classification power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable classifiers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep classification strength is being raised in a growing number of machine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoretically and empirically the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simplicity-accuracy tradeoff for voting classifiers. Then we provide an efficient ""top-down and prune"" induction heuristic, WIDC, mainly derived from recent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the first attempt to build a voting classifier as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one which was previously highly successful for decision tree induction), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for such classifiers with boosting-like approaches). While it uses a well-known induction scheme previously successful in other classes of concept representations, thus making it easy to implement and compare, WIDC also relies on recent or new results we give about particular cases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of which readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produce small, accurate, and interpretable decision committees.",0
"During interactions with human consultants, people are used to providing partial and/or inaccurate information, and still be understood and assisted. We attempt to emulate this capability of human consultants; in computer consultation systems. In this paper, we present a mechanism for handling uncertainty in plan recognition during task-oriented consultations. The uncertainty arises while choosing an appropriate interpretation of a user?s statements among many possible interpretations. Our mechanism handles this uncertainty by using probability theory to assess the probabilities of the interpretations, and complements this assessment by taking into account the information content of the interpretations. The information content of an interpretation is a measure of how well defined an interpretation is in terms of the actions to be performed on the basis of the interpretation. This measure is used to guide the inference process towards interpretations with a higher information content. The information content for an interpretation depends on the specificity and the strength of the inferences in it, where the strength of an inference depends on the reliability of the information on which the inference is based. Our mechanism has been developed for use in task-oriented consultation systems. The domain that we have chosen for exploration is that of a travel agency.",0
"The purpose of statistical disclosure control (SDC) of microdata, a.k.a. data anonymization or privacy-preserving data mining, is to publish data sets containing the answers of individual respondents in such a way that the respondents corresponding to the released records cannot be re-identified and the released data are analytically useful. SDC methods are either based on masking the original data, generating synthetic versions of them or creating hybrid versions by combining original and synthetic data. The choice of SDC methods for categorical data, especially nominal data, is much smaller than the choice of methods for numerical data. We mitigate this problem by introducing a numerical mapping for hierarchical nominal data which allows computing means, variances and covariances on them.",0
"Prediction markets provide an efficient means to assess uncertain quantities from forecasters. Traditional and competitive strictly proper scoring rules have been shown to incentivize players to provide truthful probabilistic forecasts. However, we show that when those players can cooperate, these mechanisms can instead discourage them from reporting what they really believe. When players with different beliefs are able to cooperate and form a coalition, these mechanisms admit arbitrage and there is a report that will always pay coalition members more than their truthful forecasts. If the coalition were created by an intermediary, such as a web portal, the intermediary would be guaranteed a profit.",0
"As autonomous vehicles become an every-day reality, high-accuracy pedestrian detection is of paramount practical importance. Pedestrian detection is a highly researched topic with mature methods, but most datasets focus on common scenes of people engaged in typical walking poses on sidewalks. But performance is most crucial for dangerous scenarios, such as children playing in the street or people using bicycles/skateboards in unexpected ways. Such ""in-the-tail"" data is notoriously hard to observe, making both training and testing difficult. To analyze this problem, we have collected a novel annotated dataset of dangerous scenarios called the Precarious Pedestrian dataset. Even given a dedicated collection effort, it is relatively small by contemporary standards (around 1000 images). To explore large-scale data-driven learning, we explore the use of synthetic data generated by a game engine. A significant challenge is selected the right ""priors"" or parameters for synthesis: we would like realistic data with realistic poses and object configurations. Inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks, we generate a massive amount of synthetic data and train a discriminative classifier to select a realistic subset, which we deem Synthetic Imposters. We demonstrate that this pipeline allows one to generate realistic training data by making use of rendering/animation engines. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that such data can be used to rank algorithms, suggesting that Synthetic Imposters can also be used for ""in-the-tail"" validation at test-time, a notoriously difficult challenge for real-world deployment.",0
"Despite the advances made in artificial intelligence, software agents, and robotics, there is little we see today that we can truly call a fully autonomous system. We conjecture that the main inhibitor for advancing autonomy is lack of trust. Trusted autonomy is the scientific and engineering field to establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally and efficiently.",0
"The coordination of multiple autonomous vehicles into convoys or platoons is expected on our highways in the near future. However, before such platoons can be deployed, the new autonomous behaviors of the vehicles in these platoons must be certified. An appropriate representation for vehicle platooning is as a multi-agent system in which each agent captures the ""autonomous decisions"" carried out by each vehicle. In order to ensure that these autonomous decision-making agents in vehicle platoons never violate safety requirements, we use formal verification. However, as the formal verification technique used to verify the agent code does not scale to the full system and as the global verification technique does not capture the essential verification of autonomous behavior, we use a combination of the two approaches. This mixed strategy allows us to verify safety requirements not only of a model of the system, but of the actual agent code used to program the autonomous vehicles.",0
"This paper describes a new method for reducing the error in a classifier. It uses a weight adjustment update, but includes the very simple rule of either adding or subtracting the adjustment, based on whether the data point is currently larger or smaller than the desired value, and on a point-by-point basis. This gives added flexibility to the convergence procedure, where through a series of transpositions, values far away can continue towards the desired value, whereas values that are originally much closer can oscillate from one side to the other. Tests show that the method can successfully classify some known datasets. It can also work in a batch mode, with reduced training times and can be used as part of a neural network, or classifiers in general. There are also some updates on an earlier wave shape paper.",0
Presented is a Julia meta-program that discovers compact theories from data if they exist. It writes candidate theories in Julia and then validates: tossing the bad theories and keeping the good theories. Compactness is measured by a metric: such as the number of space-time derivatives. The underlying algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of combinatorics problems and compactness serves to cut down the search space.,0
"Reinforcement learning (RL) problems are often phrased in terms of Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this thesis we go beyond MDPs and consider RL in environments that are non-Markovian, non-ergodic and only partially observable. Our focus is not on practical algorithms, but rather on the fundamental underlying problems: How do we balance exploration and exploitation? How do we explore optimally? When is an agent optimal? We follow the nonparametric realizable paradigm.",0
"Logical inference, an integral feature of the Semantic Web, is the process of deriving new triples by applying entailment rules on knowledge bases. The entailment rules are determined by the model-theoretic semantics. Incorporating context of an RDF triple (e.g., provenance, time, and location) into the inferencing process requires the formal semantics to be capable of describing the context of RDF triples also in the form of triples, or in other words, RDF contextual triples about triples. The formal semantics should also provide the rules that could entail new contextual triples about triples. In this paper, we propose the first inferencing mechanism that allows context of RDF triples, represented in the form of RDF triples about triples, to be the first-class citizens in the model-theoretic semantics and in the logical rules. Our inference mechanism is well-formalized with all new concepts being captured in the model-theoretic semantics. This formal semantics also allows us to derive a new set of entailment rules that could entail new contextual triples about triples. To demonstrate the feasibility and the scalability of the proposed mechanism, we implement a new tool in which we transform the existing knowledge bases to our representation of RDF triples about triples and provide the option for this tool to compute the inferred triples for the proposed rules. We evaluate the computation of the proposed rules on a large scale using various real-world knowledge bases such as Bio2RDF NCBI Genes and DBpedia. The results show that the computation of the inferred triples can be highly scalable. On average, one billion inferred triples adds 5-6 minutes to the overall transformation process. NCBI Genes, with 20 billion triples in total, took only 232 minutes for the transformation of 12 billion triples and added 42 minutes for inferring 8 billion triples to the overall process.",0
"The concept of evolving intelligent system (EIS) provides an effective avenue for data stream mining because it is capable of coping with two prominent issues: online learning and rapidly changing environments. We note at least three uncharted territories of existing EISs: data uncertainty, temporal system dynamic, redundant data streams. This book chapter aims at delivering a concrete solution of this problem with the algorithmic development of a novel learning algorithm, namely PANFIS++. PANFIS++ is a generalized version of the PANFIS by putting forward three important components: 1) An online active learning scenario is developed to overcome redundant data streams. This module allows to actively select data streams for the training process, thereby expediting execution time and enhancing generalization performance, 2) PANFIS++ is built upon an interval type-2 fuzzy system environment, which incorporates the so-called footprint of uncertainty. This component provides a degree of tolerance for data uncertainty. 3) PANFIS++ is structured under a recurrent network architecture with a self-feedback loop. This is meant to tackle the temporal system dynamic. The efficacy of the PANFIS++ has been numerically validated through numerous real-world and synthetic case studies, where it delivers the highest predictive accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity.",0
"Whether in groups of humans or groups of computer agents, collaboration is most effective between individuals who have the ability to coordinate on a joint strategy for collective action. However, in general a rational actor will only intend to coordinate if that actor believes the other group members have the same intention. This circular dependence makes rational coordination difficult in uncertain environments if communication between actors is unreliable and no prior agreements have been made. An important normative question with regard to coordination in these ad hoc settings is therefore how one can come to believe that other actors will coordinate, and with regard to systems involving humans, an important empirical question is how humans arrive at these expectations. We introduce an exact algorithm for computing the infinitely recursive hierarchy of graded beliefs required for rational coordination in uncertain environments, and we introduce a novel mechanism for multiagent coordination that uses it. Our algorithm is valid in any environment with a finite state space, and extensions to certain countably infinite state spaces are likely possible. We test our mechanism for multiagent coordination as a model for human decisions in a simple coordination game using existing experimental data. We then explore via simulations whether modeling humans in this way may improve human-agent collaboration.",1
"The fraud/uncollectible debt problem in the telecommunications industry presents two technical challenges: the detection and the treatment of the account given the detection. In this paper, we focus on the first problem of detection using Bayesian network models, and we briefly discuss the application of a normative expert system for the treatment at the end. We apply Bayesian network models to the problem of fraud/uncollectible debt detection for telecommunication services. In addition to being quite successful at predicting rare event outcomes, it is able to handle a mixture of categorical and continuous data. We present a performance comparison using linear and non-linear discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and Bayesian network models",0
"Domain adaptation, and transfer learning more generally, seeks to remedy the problem created when training and testing datasets are generated by different distributions. In this work, we introduce a new unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm for when there are multiple sources available to a learner. Our technique assigns a rough labeling on the target samples, then uses it to learn a transformation that aligns the two datasets before final classification. In this article we give a convenient implementation of our method, show several experiments using it, and compare it to other methods commonly used in the field.",0
"In default reasoning, usually not all possible ways of resolving conflicts between default rules are acceptable. Criteria expressing acceptable ways of resolving the conflicts may be hardwired in the inference mechanism, for example specificity in inheritance reasoning can be handled this way, or they may be given abstractly as an ordering on the default rules. In this article we investigate formalizations of the latter approach in Reiter's default logic. Our goal is to analyze and compare the computational properties of three such formalizations in terms of their computational complexity: the prioritized default logics of Baader and Hollunder, and Brewka, and a prioritized default logic that is based on lexicographic comparison. The analysis locates the propositional variants of these logics on the second and third levels of the polynomial hierarchy, and identifies the boundary between tractable and intractable inference for restricted classes of prioritized default theories.",0
"Sequential allocation is a simple and attractive mechanism for the allocation of indivisible goods. Agents take turns, according to a policy, to pick items. Sequential allocation is guaranteed to return an allocation which is efficient but may not have an optimal social welfare. We consider therefore the relation between welfare and efficiency. We study the (computational) questions of what welfare is possible or necessary depending on the choice of policy. We also consider a novel control problem in which the chair chooses a policy to improve social welfare.",0
"The historic background of algorithmic processing with regard to etymology and methodology is translated into terms of mathematical logic and Computer Science. A formal logic structure is introduced by exemplaryquestions posed to Fiqh-chapters to define alogic query language. As a foundation, ageneric algorithm for deciding Fiqh-rulings is designed to enable and further leverage rule of law (vs. rule by law) with full transparency and complete algorithmic coverage of Islamic law eventually providing legal security, legal equality, and full legal accountability.This is implemented by disentangling and reinstating classic Fiqh-methodology (usul al-Fiqh) with the expressive power of subsets of First Order Logic (FOL)sustainably substituting ad hoc reasoning with falsifiable rational argumentation. The results are discussed in formal terms of completeness, decidability and complexity of formal Fiqh-systems. AnEntscheidungsproblem for formal Fiqh-Systems is formulated and validated.",0
"We study a multiagent learning problem where agents can either learn via repeated interactions, or can follow the advice of a mediator who suggests possible actions to take. We present an algorithmthat each agent can use so that, with high probability, they can verify whether or not the mediator's advice is useful. In particular, if the mediator's advice is useful then agents will reach a correlated equilibrium, but if the mediator's advice is not useful, then agents are not harmed by using our test, and can fall back to their original learning algorithm. We then generalize our algorithm and show that in the limit it always correctly verifies the mediator's advice.",0
"We are interested in belief revision involving conditional statements where the antecedent is almost certainly false. To represent such problems, we use Ordinal Conditional Functions that may take infinite values. We model belief change in this context through simple arithmetical operations that allow us to capture the intuition that certain antecedents can not be validated by any number of observations. We frame our approach as a form of finite belief improvement, and we propose a model of conditional belief revision in which only the ""right"" hypothetical levels of implausibility are revised.",0
"When faced with complex choices, users refine their own preference criteria as they explore the catalogue of options. In this paper we propose an approach to preference elicitation suited for this scenario. We extend Coactive Learning, which iteratively collects manipulative feedback, to optionally query example critiques. User critiques are integrated into the learning model by dynamically extending the feature space. Our formulation natively supports constructive learning tasks, where the option catalogue is generated on-the-fly. We present an upper bound on the average regret suffered by the learner. Our empirical analysis highlights the promise of our approach.",1
"Diagrammatic reasoning (DR) is pervasive in human problem solving as a powerful adjunct to symbolic reasoning based on language-like representations. The research reported in this paper is a contribution to building a general purpose DR system as an extension to a SOAR-like problem solving architecture. The work is in a framework in which DR is modeled as a process where subtasks are solved, as appropriate, either by inference from symbolic representations or by interaction with a diagram, i.e., perceiving specified information from a diagram or modifying/creating objects in a diagram in specified ways according to problem solving needs. The perceptions and actions in most DR systems built so far are hand-coded for the specific application, even when the rest of the system is built using the general architecture. The absence of a general framework for executing perceptions/actions poses as a major hindrance to using them opportunistically -- the essence of open-ended search in problem solving. Our goal is to develop a framework for executing a wide variety of specified perceptions and actions across tasks/domains without human intervention. We observe that the domain/task-specific visual perceptions/actions can be transformed into domain/task-independent spatial problems. We specify a spatial problem as a quantified constraint satisfaction problem in the real domain using an open-ended vocabulary of properties, relations and actions involving three kinds of diagrammatic objects -- points, curves, regions. Solving a spatial problem from this specification requires computing the equivalent simplified quantifier-free expression, the complexity of which is inherently doubly exponential. We represent objects as configuration of simple elements to facilitate decomposition of complex problems into simpler and similar subproblems. We show that, if the symbolic solution to a subproblem can be expressed concisely, quantifiers can be eliminated from spatial problems in low-order polynomial time using similar previously solved subproblems. This requires determining the similarity of two problems, the existence of a mapping between them computable in polynomial time, and designing a memory for storing previously solved problems so as to facilitate search. The efficacy of the idea is shown by time complexity analysis. We demonstrate the proposed approach by executing perceptions and actions involved in DR tasks in two army applications.",0
"End-to-end training of deep learning-based models allows for implicit learning of intermediate representations based on the final task loss. However, the end-to-end approach ignores the useful domain knowledge encoded in explicit intermediate-level supervision. We hypothesize that using intermediate representations as auxiliary supervision at lower levels of deep networks may be a good way of combining the advantages of end-to-end training and more traditional pipeline approaches. We present experiments on conversational speech recognition where we use lower-level tasks, such as phoneme recognition, in a multitask training approach with an encoder-decoder model for direct character transcription. We compare multiple types of lower-level tasks and analyze the effects of the auxiliary tasks. Our results on the Switchboard corpus show that this approach improves recognition accuracy over a standard encoder-decoder model on the Eval2000 test set.",0
"This paper presents a model based on an hybrid system to numerically simulate the climbing phase of an aircraft. This model is then used within a trajectory prediction tool. Finally, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimization algorithm is used to tune five selected parameters, and thus improve the accuracy of the model. Incorporated within a trajectory prediction tool, this model can be used to derive the order of magnitude of the prediction error over time, and thus the domain of validity of the trajectory prediction. A first validation experiment of the proposed model is based on the errors along time for a one-time trajectory prediction at the take off of the flight with respect to the default values of the theoretical BADA model. This experiment, assuming complete information, also shows the limit of the model. A second experiment part presents an on-line trajectory prediction, in which the prediction is continuously updated based on the current aircraft position. This approach raises several issues, for which improvements of the basic model are proposed, and the resulting trajectory prediction tool shows statistically significantly more accurate results than those of the default model.",0
"Extensive work has been conducted both in game theory and logic to model strategic interaction. An important question is whether we can use these theories to design agents for interacting with people? On the one hand, they provide a formal design specification for agent strategies. On the other hand, people do not necessarily adhere to playing in accordance with these strategies, and their behavior is affected by a multitude of social and psychological factors. In this paper we will consider the question of whether strategies implied by theories of strategic behavior can be used by automated agents that interact proficiently with people. We will focus on automated agents that we built that need to interact with people in two negotiation settings: bargaining and deliberation. For bargaining we will study game-theory based equilibrium agents and for argumentation we will discuss logic-based argumentation theory. We will also consider security games and persuasion games and will discuss the benefits of using equilibrium based agents.",0
"We present an approach to propagation-based SAT encoding of combinatorial problems, Boolean equi-propagation, where constraints are modeled as Boolean functions which propagate information about equalities between Boolean literals. This information is then applied to simplify the CNF encoding of the constraints. A key factor is that considering only a small fragment of a constraint model at one time enables us to apply stronger, and even complete, reasoning to detect equivalent literals in that fragment. Once detected, equivalences apply to simplify the entire constraint model and facilitate further reasoning on other fragments. Equi-propagation in combination with partial evaluation and constraint simplification provide the foundation for a powerful approach to SAT-based finite domain constraint solving. We introduce a tool called BEE (Ben-Gurion Equi-propagation Encoder) based on these ideas and demonstrate for a variety of benchmarks that our approach leads to a considerable reduction in the size of CNF encodings and subsequent speed-ups in SAT solving times.",0
"As robots begin to cohabit with humans in semi-structured environments, the need arises to understand instructions involving rich variability---for instance, learning to ground symbols in the physical world. Realistically, this task must cope with small datasets consisting of a particular users' contextual assignment of meaning to terms. We present a method for processing a raw stream of cross-modal input---i.e., linguistic instructions, visual perception of a scene and a concurrent trace of 3D eye tracking fixations---to produce the segmentation of objects with a correspondent association to high-level concepts. To test our framework we present experiments in a table-top object manipulation scenario. Our results show our model learns the user's notion of colour and shape from a small number of physical demonstrations, generalising to identifying physical referents for novel combinations of the words.",0
"The UCT algorithm, which combines the UCB algorithm and Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), is currently the most widely used variant of MCTS. Recently, a number of investigations into applying other bandit algorithms to MCTS have produced interesting results. In this research, we will investigate the possibility of combining the improved UCB algorithm, proposed by Auer et al. (2010), with MCTS. However, various characteristics and properties of the improved UCB algorithm may not be ideal for a direct application to MCTS. Therefore, some modifications were made to the improved UCB algorithm, making it more suitable for the task of game tree search. The Mi-UCT algorithm is the application of the modified UCB algorithm applied to trees. The performance of Mi-UCT is demonstrated on the games of $9\times 9$ Go and $9\times 9$ NoGo, and has shown to outperform the plain UCT algorithm when only a small number of playouts are given, and rougly on the same level when more playouts are available.",0
"There is an increasing interest on accelerating neural networks for real-time applications. We study the student-teacher strategy, in which a small and fast student network is trained with the auxiliary information provided by a large and accurate teacher network. We use conditional adversarial networks to learn the loss function to transfer knowledge from teacher to student. The proposed method is particularly effective for relatively small student networks. Moreover, experimental results show the effect of network size when the modern networks are used as student. We empirically study trade-off between inference time and classification accuracy, and provide suggestions on choosing a proper student.",0
"We consider a setting for Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) where the learner is extended with the ability to actively select multiple environments, observing an agent's behavior on each environment. We first demonstrate that if the learner can experiment with any transition dynamics on some fixed set of states and actions, then there exists an algorithm that reconstructs the agent's reward function to the fullest extent theoretically possible, and that requires only a small (logarithmic) number of experiments. We contrast this result to what is known about IRL in single fixed environments, namely that the true reward function is fundamentally unidentifiable. We then extend this setting to the more realistic case where the learner may not select any transition dynamic, but rather is restricted to some fixed set of environments that it may try. We connect the problem of maximizing the information derived from experiments to submodular function maximization and demonstrate that a greedy algorithm is near optimal (up to logarithmic factors). Finally, we empirically validate our algorithm on an environment inspired by behavioral psychology.",0
"Knowledge graph embedding aims to embed entities and relations of knowledge graphs into low-dimensional vector spaces. Translating embedding methods regard relations as the translation from head entities to tail entities, which achieve the state-of-the-art results among knowledge graph embedding methods. However, a major limitation of these methods is the time consuming training process, which may take several days or even weeks for large knowledge graphs, and result in great difficulty in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel framework for translating embedding methods, called ParTrans-X, which enables the methods to be paralleled without locks by utilizing the distinguished structures of knowledge graphs. Experiments on two datasets with three typical translating embedding methods, i.e., TransE [3], TransH [17], and a more efficient variant TransE- AdaGrad [10] validate that ParTrans-X can speed up the training process by more than an order of magnitude.",0
"The problem of learning discrete Bayesian networks from data is encoded as a weighted MAX-SAT problem and the MaxWalkSat local search algorithm is used to address it. For each dataset, the per-variable summands of the (BDeu) marginal likelihood for different choices of parents ('family scores') are computed prior to applying MaxWalkSat. Each permissible choice of parents for each variable is encoded as a distinct propositional atom and the associated family score encoded as a 'soft' weighted single-literal clause. Two approaches to enforcing acyclicity are considered: either by encoding the ancestor relation or by attaching a total order to each graph and encoding that. The latter approach gives better results. Learning experiments have been conducted on 21 synthetic datasets sampled from 7 BNs. The largest dataset has 10,000 datapoints and 60 variables producing (for the 'ancestor' encoding) a weighted CNF input file with 19,932 atoms and 269,367 clauses. For most datasets, MaxWalkSat quickly finds BNs with higher BDeu score than the 'true' BN. The effect of adding prior information is assessed. It is further shown that Bayesian model averaging can be effected by collecting BNs generated during the search.",0
"Kiwi is a minimalist and extendable Constraint Programming (CP) solver specifically designed for education. The particularities of Kiwi stand in its generic trailing state restoration mechanism and its modulable use of variables. By developing Kiwi, the author does not aim to provide an alternative to full featured constraint solvers but rather to provide readers with a basic architecture that will (hopefully) help them to understand the core mechanisms hidden under the hood of constraint solvers, to develop their own extended constraint solver, or to test innovative ideas.",0
"This article introduces a modified simulated annealing optimization approach for automatically determining optimal energy management strategies in grid-connected, storage-augmented, photovoltaics-supplied prosumer buildings and neighbourhoods based on user-specific goals. For evaluating the modified simulated annealing optimizer, a number of test scenarios in the field of energy self-consumption maximization are defined and results are compared to a gradient descent and a total state space search approach. The benchmarking against these two reference methods demonstrates that the modified simulated annealing approach is able to find significantly better solutions than the gradient descent algorithm - being equal or very close to the global optimum - with significantly less computational effort and processing time than the total state space search approach.",0
"Critical node problems involve identifying a subset of critical nodes from an undirected graph whose removal results in optimizing a pre-defined measure over the residual graph. As useful models for a variety of practical applications, these problems are computational challenging. In this paper, we study the classic critical node problem (CNP) and introduce an effective memetic algorithm for solving CNP. The proposed algorithm combines a double backbone-based crossover operator (to generate promising offspring solutions), a component-based neighborhood search procedure (to find high-quality local optima) and a rank-based pool updating strategy (to guarantee a healthy population). Specially, the component-based neighborhood search integrates two key techniques, i.e., two-phase node exchange strategy and node weighting scheme. The double backbone-based crossover extends the idea of general backbone-based crossovers. Extensive evaluations on 42 synthetic and real-world benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm discovers 21 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous best-known upper bounds. We also demonstrate the relevance of our algorithm for effectively solving a variant of the classic CNP, called the cardinality-constrained critical node problem. Finally, we investigate the usefulness of each key algorithmic component.",0
"In this paper we introduce a computational-level model of theory of mind (ToM) based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), and we analyze its computational complexity. The model is a special case of DEL model checking. We provide a parameterized complexity analysis, considering several aspects of DEL (e.g., number of agents, size of preconditions, etc.) as parameters. We show that model checking for DEL is PSPACE-hard, also when restricted to single-pointed models and S5 relations, thereby solving an open problem in the literature. Our approach is aimed at formalizing current intractability claims in the cognitive science literature regarding computational models of ToM.",0
"In this work, answer-set programs that specify repairs of databases are used as a basis for solving computational and reasoning problems about causes for query answers from databases.",0
"We analyse the complexity of environments according to the policies that need to be used to achieve high performance. The performance results for a population of policies leads to a distribution that is examined in terms of policy complexity and analysed through several diagrams and indicators. The notion of environment response curve is also introduced, by inverting the performance results into an ability scale. We apply all these concepts, diagrams and indicators to a minimalistic environment class, agent-populated elementary cellular automata, showing how the difficulty, discriminating power and ranges (previous to normalisation) may vary for several environments.",0
"The success of deep learning often derives from well-chosen operational building blocks. In this work, we revise the temporal convolution operation in CNNs to better adapt it to text processing. Instead of concatenating word representations, we appeal to tensor algebra and use low-rank n-gram tensors to directly exploit interactions between words already at the convolution stage. Moreover, we extend the n-gram convolution to non-consecutive words to recognize patterns with intervening words. Through a combination of low-rank tensors, and pattern weighting, we can efficiently evaluate the resulting convolution operation via dynamic programming. We test the resulting architecture on standard sentiment classification and news categorization tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of accuracy and training speed. For instance, we obtain 51.4% accuracy on the fine-grained sentiment classification task.",1
"Satisfiability of random Boolean expressions built from many clauses with K variables per clause (random K-satisfiability) is a fundamental problem in combinatorial discrete optimization. Here we study random K-satisfiability for K = 3 and K = 4 by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm. This algorithm is able to find, in a time linear in the problem size, solutions within a region never reached before, very close to SAT-UNSAT threshold, and even beyond the freezing threshold. For K = 3 the algorithmic threshold practically coincides with the SAT-UNSAT threshold. We also study the whitening process on all the solutions found by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm: none contains frozen variables and the whitening procedure is able to remove all variables, following a two-steps process, in a time that diverges approaching the algorithmic threshold.",0
"Data Mining is the process of extracting useful patterns from the huge amount of database and many data mining techniques are used for mining these patterns. Recently, one of the remarkable facts in higher educational institute is the rapid growth data and this educational data is expanding quickly without any advantage to the educational management. The main aim of the management is to refine the education standard; therefore by applying the various data mining techniques on this data one can get valuable information. This research study proposed the ""classification model for the student's enrollment process in higher educational courses using data mining techniques"". Additionally, this study contributes to finding some patterns that are meaningful to management.",0
"Some instances of creative thinking require an agent to build and test hypothetical theories. Such a reasoner needs to explore the space of not only those situations that have occurred in the past, but also those that are rationally conceivable. In this paper we present a formalism for exploring the space of conceivable situation-models for those domains in which the knowledge is primarily probabilistic in nature. The formalism seeks to construct consistent, minimal, and desirable situation-descriptions by selecting suitable domain-attributes and dependency relationships from the available domain knowledge.",0
"A complex nature of big data resources demands new methods for structuring especially for textual content. WordNet is a good knowledge source for comprehensive abstraction of natural language as its good implementations exist for many languages. Since WordNet embeds natural language in the form of a complex network, a transformation mechanism WordNet2Vec is proposed in the paper. It creates vectors for each word from WordNet. These vectors encapsulate general position - role of a given word towards all other words in the natural language. Any list or set of such vectors contains knowledge about the context of its component within the whole language. Such word representation can be easily applied to many analytic tasks like classification or clustering. The usefulness of the WordNet2Vec method was demonstrated in sentiment analysis, i.e. classification with transfer learning for the real Amazon opinion textual dataset.",0
"Expert System is developed as consulting service for users spread or public requires affordable access. The Internet has become a medium for such services, but presence of mobile devices make the access becomes more widespread by utilizing mobile web and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). Applying expert systems applications over the web and WAP requires a knowledge base representation that can be accessed simultaneously. This paper proposes single database to accommodate the knowledge representation with decision tree mapping approach. Because of the database exist, consulting application through both web and WAP can access it to provide expert system services options for more affordable for public.",0
"Major advances in Question Answering technology were needed for IBM Watson to play Jeopardy! at championship level -- the show requires rapid-fire answers to challenging natural language questions, broad general knowledge, high precision, and accurate confidence estimates. In addition, Jeopardy! features four types of decision making carrying great strategic importance: (1) Daily Double wagering; (2) Final Jeopardy wagering; (3) selecting the next square when in control of the board; (4) deciding whether to attempt to answer, i.e., ""buzz in."" Using sophisticated strategies for these decisions, that properly account for the game state and future event probabilities, can significantly boost a players overall chances to win, when compared with simple ""rule of thumb"" strategies. This article presents our approach to developing Watsons game-playing strategies, comprising development of a faithful simulation model, and then using learning and Monte-Carlo methods within the simulator to optimize Watsons strategic decision-making. After giving a detailed description of each of our game-strategy algorithms, we then focus in particular on validating the accuracy of the simulators predictions, and documenting performance improvements using our methods. Quantitative performance benefits are shown with respect to both simple heuristic strategies, and actual human contestant performance in historical episodes. We further extend our analysis of human play to derive a number of valuable and counterintuitive examples illustrating how human contestants may improve their performance on the show.",0
"We propose a method called EDML for learning MAP parameters in binary Bayesian networks under incomplete data. The method assumes Beta priors and can be used to learn maximum likelihood parameters when the priors are uninformative. EDML exhibits interesting behaviors, especially when compared to EM. We introduce EDML, explain its origin, and study some of its properties both analytically and empirically.",0
"Recent progress in randomized motion planners has led to the development of a new class of sampling-based algorithms that provide asymptotic optimality guarantees, notably the RRT* and the PRM* algorithms. Careful analysis reveals that the so-called ""rewiring"" step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a local policy iteration (PI) step (i.e., a local policy evaluation step followed by a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of samples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost surely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI) are common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this observation, recently, the RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm has been proposed, which performs, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka ""backups"") on those vertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path (i.e., the ""promising"" vertices). The RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm thus utilizes dynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly generated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on this key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by iterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration instead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive parallelization. Contrary to the RRT* algorithm, the policy improvement during the rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices that are classified as ""promising"" during the current iteration. This tends to speed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly named Policy Iteration-RRT$^{\#}$ (PI-RRT$^{\#}$) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired algorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods.",0
"This extended abstract presents an overview on NP-hard optimization problems with multiple interdependent components. These problems occur in many real-world applications: industrial applications, engineering, and logistics. The fact that these problems are composed of many sub-problems that are NP-hard makes them even more challenging to solve using exact algorithms. This is mainly due to the high complexity of this class of algorithms and the hardness of the problems themselves. The main source of difficulty of these problems is the presence of internal dependencies between sub-problems. This aspect of interdependence of components is presented, and some outlines on solving approaches are briefly introduced from a (meta)heuristics and evolutionary computation perspective.",0
"Iterated applications of belief change operators are essential for different scenarios such as that of ontology evolution where new information is not presented at once but only in piecemeal fashion within a sequence. I discuss iterated applications of so called reinterpretation operators that trace conflicts between ontologies back to the ambiguous of symbols and that provide conflict resolution strategies with bridging axioms. The discussion centers on adaptations of the classical iteration postulates according to Darwiche and Pearl. The main result of the paper is that reinterpretation operators fulfill the postulates for sequences containing only atomic triggers. For complex triggers, a fulfillment is not guaranteed and indeed there are different reasons for the different postulates why they should not be fulfilled in the particular scenario of ontology revision with well developed ontologies.",0
"Recently introduced composition operator for credal sets is an analogy of such operators in probability, possibility, evidence and valuation-based systems theories. It was designed to construct multidimensional models (in the framework of credal sets) from a system of low- dimensional credal sets. In this paper we study its potential from the computational point of view utilizing methods of polyhedral geometry.",0
"Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) fall into two high-level categories: network-based systems (NIDS) that monitor network behaviors, and host-based systems (HIDS) that monitor system calls. In this work, we present a general technique for both systems. We use anomaly detection, which identifies patterns not conforming to a historic norm. In both types of systems, the rates of change vary dramatically over time (due to burstiness) and over components (due to service difference). To efficiently model such systems, we use continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) and avoid specifying a fixed update interval common to discrete-time models. We build generative models from the normal training data, and abnormal behaviors are flagged based on their likelihood under this norm. For NIDS, we construct a hierarchical CTBN model for the network packet traces and use Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering to learn the parameters. We illustrate the power of our method through experiments on detecting real worms and identifying hosts on two publicly available network traces, the MAWI dataset and the LBNL dataset. For HIDS, we develop a novel learning method to deal with the finite resolution of system log file time stamps, without losing the benefits of our continuous time model. We demonstrate the method by detecting intrusions in the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset.",0
"We present two sampling algorithms for probabilistic confidence inference in Bayesian networks. These two algorithms (we call them AIS-BN-mu and AIS-BN-sigma algorithms) guarantee that estimates of posterior probabilities are with a given probability within a desired precision bound. Our algorithms are based on recent advances in sampling algorithms for (1) estimating the mean of bounded random variables and (2) adaptive importance sampling in Bayesian networks. In addition to a simple stopping rule for sampling that they provide, the AIS-BN-mu and AIS-BN-sigma algorithms are capable of guiding the learning process in the AIS-BN algorithm. An empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithms shows excellent performance, even for very unlikely evidence.",0
"Web services are software systems designed for supporting interoperable dynamic cross-enterprise interactions. The result of attacks to Web services can be catastrophic and causing the disclosure of enterprises' confidential data. As new approaches of attacking arise every day, anomaly detection systems seem to be invaluable tools in this context. The aim of this work has been to target the attacks that reside in the Web service layer and the extensible markup language (XML)-structured simple object access protocol (SOAP) messages. After studying the shortcomings of the existing solutions, a new approach for detecting anomalies in Web services is outlined. More specifically, the proposed technique illustrates how to identify anomalies by employing mining methods on XML-structured SOAP messages. This technique also takes the advantages of tree-based association rule mining to extract knowledge in the training phase, which is used in the test phase to detect anomalies. In addition, this novel composition of techniques brings nearly low false alarm rate while maintaining the detection rate reasonably high, which is shown by a case study.",0
"This paper considers the textual guidelines proposed by People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to manage earthquake, tsunami and try to represent it in a more formal way in order to provide means to simulate, analyse and adapt it. After a state of the art about the coordination models and their possible applications to disaster management, we give an overview of the tsunami plan of Ho Chi Minh City and then its graphical representation with BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). We then show how to exploit it with workflow tools to simulate (YAWL language) and analyse it (PROM tool)",0
"The paper introduces k-bounded MAP inference, a parameterization of MAP inference in Markov logic networks. k-Bounded MAP states are MAP states with at most k active ground atoms of hidden (non-evidence) predicates. We present a novel delayed column generation algorithm and provide empirical evidence that the algorithm efficiently computes k-bounded MAP states for meaningful real-world graph matching problems. The underlying idea is that, instead of solving one large optimization problem, it is often more efficient to tackle several small ones.",0
"This paper presents a system capable of autonomously mapping the visible part of a bounded three-dimensional structure using a mobile ground robot equipped with a depth sensor. We describe motion planning strategies to determine appropriate successive viewpoints and attempt to fill holes automatically in a point cloud produced by the sensing and perception layer. We develop a local motion planner using potential fields to maintain a desired distance from the structure. The emphasis is on accurately reconstructing a 3D model of a structure of moderate size rather than mapping large open environments, with applications for example in architecture, construction and inspection. The proposed algorithms do not require any initialization in the form of a mesh model or a bounding box. We compare via simulations the performance of our policies to the classic frontier based exploration algorithm. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach for different structure sizes, levels of localization accuracy and range of the depth sensor.",0
"This is a contribution to the formalization of the concept of agents in multivariate Markov chains. Agents are commonly defined as entities that act, perceive, and are goal-directed. In a multivariate Markov chain (e.g. a cellular automaton) the transition matrix completely determines the dynamics. This seems to contradict the possibility of acting entities within such a system. Here we present definitions of actions and perceptions within multivariate Markov chains based on entity-sets. Entity-sets represent a largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns that are considered as all the entities within the Markov chain. For example, the entity-set can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or complete specific integration. Importantly, the perception-action loop also induces an entity-set and is a multivariate Markov chain. We then show that our definition of actions leads to non-heteronomy and that of perceptions specialize to the usual concept of perception in the perception-action loop.",0
"Description Logics are widely used to describe knowledge bases. Their purpose is to describe static knowledge. Our goal, in the other hand, is to be able to do the same thing with dynamic knowledge. To reach that objective we introduce substitution modifying concepts and roles. We investigate the effect of adding such substitutions to the logic SROIQ, yielding SROIQsigma, and prove that the satisfiability of a property is still decidable in SROIQsigma.",0
"In reinforcement learning, we often define goals by specifying rewards within desirable states. One problem with this approach is that we typically need to redefine the rewards each time the goal changes, which often requires some understanding of the solution in the agents environment. When humans are learning to complete tasks, we regularly utilize alternative sources that guide our understanding of the problem. Such task representations allow one to specify goals on their own terms, thus providing specifications that can be appropriately interpreted across various environments. This motivates our own work, in which we represent goals in environments that are different from the agents. We introduce Cross-Domain Perceptual Reward (CDPR) functions, learned rewards that represent the visual similarity between an agents state and a cross-domain goal image. We report results for learning the CDPRs with a deep neural network and using them to solve two tasks with deep reinforcement learning.",0
"The elusive quest for intelligence in artificial intelligence prompts us to consider that instituting human-level intelligence in systems may be (still) in the realm of utopia. In about a quarter century, we have witnessed the winter of AI (1990) being transformed and transported to the zenith of tabloid fodder about AI (2015). The discussion at hand is about the elements that constitute the canonical idea of intelligence. The delivery of intelligence as a pay-per-use-service, popping out of an app or from a shrink-wrapped software defined point solution, is in contrast to the bio-inspired view of intelligence as an outcome, perhaps formed from a tapestry of events, cross-pollinated by instances, each with its own microcosm of experiences and learning, which may not be discrete all-or-none functions but continuous, over space and time. The enterprise world may not require, aspire or desire such an engaged solution to improve its services for enabling digital transformation through the deployment of digital twins, for example. One might ask whether the ""work-flow on steroids"" version of decision support may suffice for intelligence? Are we harking back to the era of rule based expert systems? The image conjured by the publicity machines offers deep solutions with human-level AI and preposterous claims about capturing the ""brain in a box"" by 2020. Even emulating insects may be difficult in terms of real progress. Perhaps we can try to focus on worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) which may be better suited for what business needs to quench its thirst for so-called intelligence in AI.",0
"We present tropical games, a generalization of combinatorial min-max games based on tropical algebras. Our model breaks the traditional symmetry of rational zero-sum games where players have exactly opposed goals (min vs. max), is more widely applicable than min-max and also supports a form of pruning, despite it being less effective than alpha-beta. Actually, min-max games may be seen as particular cases where both the game and its dual are tropical: when the dual of a tropical game is also tropical, the power of alpha-beta is completely recovered. We formally develop the model and prove that the tropical pruning strategy is correct, then conclude by showing how the problem of approximated parsing can be modeled as a tropical game, profiting from pruning.",0
"In Pawlak's rough set theory, each rough set is approximated by a pair of lower and upper approximations. To measure numerically the roughness of an approximation, Pawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the cardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness measure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with respect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements have been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this paper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After axiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a unified construction of roughness measure, called generalized Pawlak roughness measure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the improved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our generalized Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more generalized Pawlak roughness measures as well. The advantage of our axiomatic approach is that some properties of a roughness measure follow immediately as soon as the measure satisfies the relevant axiomatic definition.",0
"We introduce TensorFlow Agents, an efficient infrastructure paradigm for building parallel reinforcement learning algorithms in TensorFlow. We simulate multiple environments in parallel, and group them to perform the neural network computation on a batch rather than individual observations. This allows the TensorFlow execution engine to parallelize computation, without the need for manual synchronization. Environments are stepped in separate Python processes to progress them in parallel without interference of the global interpreter lock. As part of this project, we introduce BatchPPO, an efficient implementation of the proximal policy optimization algorithm. By open sourcing TensorFlow Agents, we hope to provide a flexible starting point for future projects that accelerates future research in the field.",0
"Liu, et al., 2009 developed a transformation of a class of non-Gaussian univariate distributions into Gaussian distributions. Liu and collaborators (2012) subsequently applied the transform to search for graphical causal models for a number of empirical data sets. To our knowledge, there has been no published investigation by simulation of the conditions under which the transform aids, or harms, standard graphical model search procedures. We consider here how the transform affects the performance of two search algorithms in particular, PC (Spirtes et al., 2000; Meek 1995) and GES (Meek 1997; Chickering 2002). We find that the transform is harmless but ineffective for most cases but quite effective in very special cases for GES, namely, for moderate non-Gaussianity and moderate non-linearity. For strong-linearity, another algorithm, PC-GES (a combination of PC with GES), is equally effective.",0
"Local search methods can quickly find good quality solutions in cases where systematic search methods might take a large amount of time. Moreover, in the context of pattern set mining, exhaustive search methods are not applicable due to the large search space they have to explore. In this paper, we propose the application of stochastic local search to solve the pattern set mining. Specifically, to the task of concept learning. We applied a number of local search algorithms on a standard benchmark instances for pattern set mining and the results show the potentials for further exploration.",0
"Exploration in an unknown environment is the core functionality for mobile robots. Learning-based exploration methods, including convolutional neural networks, provide excellent strategies without human-designed logic for the feature extraction. But the conventional supervised learning algorithms cost lots of efforts on the labeling work of datasets inevitably. Scenes not included in the training set are mostly unrecognized either. We propose a deep reinforcement learning method for the exploration of mobile robots in an indoor environment with the depth information from an RGB-D sensor only. Based on the Deep Q-Network framework, the raw depth image is taken as the only input to estimate the Q values corresponding to all moving commands. The training of the network weights is end-to-end. In arbitrarily constructed simulation environments, we show that the robot can be quickly adapted to unfamiliar scenes without any man-made labeling. Besides, through analysis of receptive fields of feature representations, deep reinforcement learning motivates the convolutional networks to estimate the traversability of the scenes. The test results are compared with the exploration strategies separately based on deep learning or reinforcement learning. Even trained only in the simulated environment, experimental results in real-world environment demonstrate that the cognitive ability of robot controller is dramatically improved compared with the supervised method. We believe it is the first time that raw sensor information is used to build cognitive exploration strategy for mobile robots through end-to-end deep reinforcement learning.",0
"Within the framework proposed in this paper, we address the issue of extending the certain networks to a fuzzy certain networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge. This paper proposes a framework that combines two disciplines to exploit their own advantages in uncertain and imprecise knowledge representation problems. The framework proposed is a possibilistic logic based one in which Bayesian nodes and their properties are represented by local necessity-valued knowledge base. Data in properties are interpreted as set of valuated formulas. In our contribution possibilistic Bayesian networks have a qualitative part and a quantitative part, represented by local knowledge bases. The general idea is to study how a fusion of these two formalisms would permit representing compact way to solve efficiently problems for knowledge representation. We show how to apply possibility and necessity measures to the problem of knowledge representation with large scale data. On the other hand fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The general aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic.",0
"Acoustic event detection is essential for content analysis and description of multimedia recordings. The majority of current literature on the topic learns the detectors through fully-supervised techniques employing strongly labeled data. However, the labels available for online multimedia data are generally weak and do not provide sufficient detail for such methods to be employed. In this paper we propose a framework for learning acoustic event detectors using only weakly labeled data based on a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework. We first show that audio event detection using weak data can be formulated as an MIL problem. We then suggest two frameworks for solving multiple-instance learning, one based on neural networks, and the second on support vector machines. The proposed methods can help in removing the time consuming and expensive process of manually annotating data to facilitate fully supervised learning. Our proposed framework can not only successfully detect events in a recording but can also provide temporal locations of events in the recording. This is interesting as these information were never known in the first place for weakly labeled data.",0
In this paper we present a new concept called generalized neutrosophic soft set. This concept incorporates the beneficial properties of both generalized neutrosophic set introduced by A.A. Salama [7]and soft set techniques proposed by Molodtsov [4]. We also study some properties of this concept. Some definitions and operations have been introduced on generalized neutrosophic soft set. Finally we present an application of generalized neuutrosophic soft set in decision making problem.,0
"Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However, there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this paper we propose Conformative Filtering (CoF) as a novel method for addressing the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA) to identify taste-based user groups, and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in the groups. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains show that CoF has superior performance compared to other baselines and more than 10% improvement in Recall@5 and Recall@10 is observed.",0
"We examine the class of languages that can be defined entirely in terms of provability in an extension of the sorted type theory (Ty_n) by embedding the logic of phonologies, without introduction of special types for syntactic entities. This class is proven to precisely coincide with the class of logically closed languages that may be thought of as functions from expressions to sets of logically equivalent Ty_n terms. For a specific sub-class of logically closed languages that are described by finite sets of rules or rule schemata, we find effective procedures for building a compact Ty_n representation, involving a finite number of axioms or axiom schemata. The proposed formalism is characterized by some useful features unavailable in a two-component architecture of a language model. A further specialization and extension of the formalism with a context type enable effective account of intensional and dynamic semantics.",0
"Crowdsourcing, a major economic issue, is the fact that the firm outsources internal task to the crowd. It is a form of digital subcontracting for the general public. The evaluation of the participants work quality is a major issue in crowdsourcing. Indeed, contributions must be controlled to ensure the effectiveness and relevance of the campaign. We are particularly interested in small, fast and not automatable tasks. Several methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but they are applicable when the ""golden truth"" is not always known. This work has the particularity to propose a method for calculating the degree of expertise in the presence of gold data in crowdsourcing. This method is based on the belief function theory and proposes a structuring of data using graphs. The proposed approach will be assessed and applied to the data.",0
"In the propositional setting, the marginal problem is to find a (maximum-entropy) distribution that has some given marginals. We study this problem in a relational setting and make the following contributions. First, we compare two different notions of relational marginals. Second, we show a duality between the resulting relational marginal problems and the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of relational models, which generalizes a well-known duality from the propositional setting. Third, by exploiting the relational marginal formulation, we present a statistically sound method to learn the parameters of relational models that will be applied in settings where the number of constants differs between the training and test data. Furthermore, based on a relational generalization of marginal polytopes, we characterize cases where the standard estimators based on feature's number of true groundings needs to be adjusted and we quantitatively characterize the consequences of these adjustments. Fourth, we prove bounds on expected errors of the estimated parameters, which allows us to lower-bound, among other things, the effective sample size of relational training data.",0
"Recent results have shown that the MCTS algorithm (a new, adaptive, randomized optimization algorithm) is effective in a remarkably diverse set of applications in Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, and High Energy Physics. MCTS can find good solutions without domain dependent heuristics, using the UCT formula to balance exploitation and exploration. It has been suggested that the optimum in the exploitation- exploration balance differs for different search tree sizes: small search trees needs more exploitation; large search trees need more exploration. Small search trees occur in variations of MCTS, such as parallel and ensemble approaches. This paper investigates the possibility of improving the performance of Ensemble UCT by increasing the level of exploitation. As the search trees becomes smaller we achieve an improved performance. The results are important for improving the performance of large scale parallelism of MCTS.",0
"Possibilistic logic is a well-known graded logic of uncertainty suitable to reason under incomplete information and partially inconsistent knowledge, which is built upon classical first order logic. There exists for Possibilistic logic a proof procedure based on a refutation complete resolution-style calculus. Recently, a syntactical extension of first order Possibilistic logic (called PLFC) dealing with fuzzy constants and fuzzily restricted quantifiers has been proposed. Our aim is to present steps towards both the formalization of PLFC itself and an automated deduction system for it by (i) providing a formal semantics; (ii) defining a sound resolution-style calculus by refutation; and (iii) describing a first-order proof procedure for PLFC clauses based on (ii) and on a novel notion of most general substitution of two literals in a resolution step. In contrast to standard Possibilistic logic semantics, truth-evaluation of formulas with fuzzy constants are many-valued instead of boolean, and consequently an extended notion of possibilistic uncertainty is also needed.",0
"This paper presents a trust computation for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster Shafer theory and subjective logic. We proposed a method that allows a trust computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. An example of case study for the trust computation is the United States of America Great Britain relations. The method supports decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be known as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.",0
"To find all extreme points of multimodal functions is called extremum problem, which is a well known difficult issue in optimization fields. Applying ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve this problem is rarely reported. The method of applying ACO to solve extremum problem is explored in this paper.

"The construction of a reference ontology for a large domain still remains an hard human task. The process is sometimes assisted by software tools that facilitate the information extraction from a textual corpus. Despite of the great use of XML Schema files on the internet and especially in the B2B domain, tools that offer a complete semantic analysis of XML schemas are really rare. In this paper we introduce Janus, a tool for automatically building a reference knowledge base starting from XML Schema files. Janus also provides different useful views to simplify B2B application integration.",0
"The paper concerns the probabilistic evaluation of plans in the presence of unmeasured variables, each plan consisting of several concurrent or sequential actions. We establish a graphical criterion for recognizing when the effects of a given plan can be predicted from passive observations on measured variables only. When the criterion is satisfied, a closed-form expression is provided for the probability that the plan will achieve a specified goal.",0
"Making a computational agent 'social' has implications for how it perceives itself and the environment in which it is situated, including the ability to recognise the behaviours of others. We point to recent work on social planning, i.e. planning in settings where the social context is relevant in the assessment of the beliefs and capabilities of others, and in making appropriate choices of what to do next.",0
"Object reconstruction is an important task in many fields of application as it allows to generate digital representations of our physical world used as base for analysis, planning, construction, visualization or other aims. A reconstruction itself normally is based on reliable data (images, 3D point clouds for example) expressing the object in his complete extent. This data then has to be compiled and analyzed in order to extract all necessary geometrical elements, which represent the object and form a digital copy of it. Traditional strategies are largely based on manual interaction and interpretation, because with increasing complexity of objects human understanding is inevitable to achieve acceptable and reliable results. But human interaction is time consuming and expensive, why many researches has already been invested to use algorithmic support, what allows to speed up the process and to reduce manual work load. Presently most of such supporting algorithms are data-driven and concentate on specific features of the objects, being accessible to numerical models. By means of these models, which normally will represent geometrical (flatness, roughness, for example) or physical features (color, texture), the data is classified and analyzed. This is successful for objects with low complexity, but gets to its limits with increasing complexness of objects. Then purely numerical strategies are not able to sufficiently model the reality. Therefore, the intention of our approach is to take human cognitive strategy as an example, and to simulate extraction processes based on available human defined knowledge for the objects of interest. Such processes will introduce a semantic structure for the objects and guide the algorithms used to detect and recognize objects, which will yield a higher effectiveness. Hence, our research proposes an approach using knowledge to guide the algorithms in 3D point cloud and image processing.",0
"The use of Structured English as a computation independent knowledge representation format for non-technical users in business rules representation has been proposed in OMGs Semantics and Business Vocabulary Representation (SBVR). In the legal domain we face a similar problem. Formal representation languages, such as OASIS LegalRuleML and legal ontologies (LKIF, legal OWL2 ontologies etc.) support the technical knowledge engineer and the automated reasoning. But, they can be hardly used directly by the legal domain experts who do not have a computer science background. In this paper we adapt the SBVR Structured English approach for the legal domain and implement a proof-of-concept, called KR4IPLaw, which enables legal domain experts to represent their knowledge in Structured English in a computational independent and hence, for them, more usable way. The benefit of this approach is that the underlying pre-defined semantics of the Structured English approach makes transformations into formal languages such as OASIS LegalRuleML and OWL2 ontologies possible. We exemplify our approach in the domain of patent law.",0
"In this paper, we illustrate the modeling of a reservoir property (sand fraction) from seismic attributes namely seismic impedance, seismic amplitude, and instantaneous frequency using Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) approach. Input dataset includes 3D post-stacked seismic attributes and six well logs acquired from a hydrocarbon field located in the western coast of India. Presence of thin sand and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and target reservoir variables. Neural networks have shown its potential to model such nonlinear mappings; however, uncertainties associated with the model and datasets are still a concern. Hence, introduction of Fuzzy Logic (FL) is beneficial for handling these uncertainties. More specifically, hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of neural networks. The documented results in this study demonstrate acceptable resemblance between target and predicted variables, and hence, encourage the application of integrated machine learning approaches such as Neuro-Fuzzy in reservoir characterization domain. Furthermore, visualization of the variation of sand probability in the study area would assist in identifying placement of potential wells for future drilling operations.",0
We define a context-sensitive temporal probability logic for representing classes of discrete-time temporal Bayesian networks. Context constraints allow inference to be focused on only the relevant portions of the probabilistic knowledge. We provide a declarative semantics for our language. We present a Bayesian network construction algorithm whose generated networks give sound and complete answers to queries. We use related concepts in logic programming to justify our approach. We have implemented a Bayesian network construction algorithm for a subset of the theory and demonstrate it's application to the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for acute cardiac conditions.,0
"Our hypothesis is that by equipping certain agents in a multi-agent system controlling an intelligent building with automated decision support, two important factors will be increased. The first is energy saving in the building. The second is customer value---how the people in the building experience the effects of the actions of the agents. We give evidence for the truth of this hypothesis through experimental findings related to tools for artificial decision making. A number of assumptions related to agent control, through monitoring and delegation of tasks to other kinds of agents, of rooms at a test site are relaxed. Each assumption controls at least one uncertainty that complicates considerably the procedures for selecting actions part of each such agent. We show that in realistic decision situations, room-controlling agents can make bounded rational decisions even under dynamic real-time constraints. This result can be, and has been, generalized to other domains with even harsher time constraints.",0
"A qualitative representation $\phi$ is like an ordinary representation of a relation algebra, but instead of requiring $(a; b)^\phi = a^\phi | b^\phi$, as we do for ordinary representations, we only require that $c^\phi\supseteq a^\phi | b^\phi \iff c\geq a ; b$, for each $c$ in the algebra. A constraint network is qualitatively satisfiable if its nodes can be mapped to elements of a qualitative representation, preserving the constraints. If a constraint network is satisfiable then it is clearly qualitatively satisfiable, but the converse can fail. However, for a wide range of relation algebras including the point algebra, the Allen Interval Algebra, RCC8 and many others, a network is satisfiable if and only if it is qualitatively satisfiable.",0
"In the last decade, several architectures have been proposed for exact computation of marginals using local computation. In this paper, we compare three architectures - Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter, Hugin, and Shenoy-Shafer - from the perspective of graphical structure for message propagation, message-passing scheme, computational efficiency, and storage efficiency.",0
"We propose a new approach to the theoretical analysis of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) and the Bethe free energy (BFE) by establishing a formula to connect LBP and BFE with a graph zeta function. The proposed approach is applicable to a wide class of models including multinomial and Gaussian types. The connection derives a number of new theoretical results on LBP and BFE. This paper focuses two of such topics. One is the analysis of the region where the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive definite, which derives the non-convexity of BFE for graphs with multiple cycles, and a condition of convexity on a restricted set. This analysis also gives a new condition for the uniqueness of the LBP fixed point. The other result is to clarify the relation between the local stability of a fixed point of LBP and local minima of the BFE, which implies, for example, that a locally stable fixed point of the Gaussian LBP is a local minimum of the Gaussian Bethe free energy.",0
"We present a novel particle filtering algorithm for tracking a moving sound source using a microphone array. If there are N microphones in the array, we track all $N \choose 2$ delays with a single particle filter over time. Since it is known that tracking in high dimensions is rife with difficulties, we instead integrate into our particle filter a model of the low dimensional manifold that these delays lie on. Our manifold model is based off of work on modeling low dimensional manifolds via random projection trees [1]. In addition, we also introduce a new weighting scheme to our particle filtering algorithm based on recent advancements in online learning. We show that our novel TDOA tracking algorithm that integrates a manifold model can greatly outperform standard particle filters on this audio tracking task.",0
"Reinforcement Learning (RL) can model complex behavior policies for goal-directed sequential decision making tasks. A hallmark of RL algorithms is Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using next state's value function. $\lambda$-returns generalize beyond 1-step returns and strike a balance between Monte Carlo and TD learning methods. While lambda-returns have been extensively studied in RL, they haven't been explored a lot in Deep RL. This paper's first contribution is an exhaustive benchmarking of lambda-returns. Although mathematically tractable, the use of exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our second major contribution is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. This allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. In contrast, lambda-returns restrict RL agents to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. Autodidactic returns can be used for improving any RL algorithm which uses TD learning. We empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.",0
"Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled framework for sequential planning in uncertain single agent settings. An extension of POMDPs to multiagent settings, called interactive POMDPs (I-POMDPs), replaces POMDP belief spaces with interactive hierarchical belief systems which represent an agent's belief about the physical world, about beliefs of other agents, and about their beliefs about others' beliefs. This modification makes the difficulties of obtaining solutions due to complexity of the belief and policy spaces even more acute. We describe a general method for obtaining approximate solutions of I-POMDPs based on particle filtering (PF). We introduce the interactive PF, which descends the levels of the interactive belief hierarchies and samples and propagates beliefs at each level. The interactive PF is able to mitigate the belief space complexity, but it does not address the policy space complexity. To mitigate the policy space complexity -- sometimes also called the curse of history -- we utilize a complementary method based on sampling likely observations while building the look ahead reachability tree. While this approach does not completely address the curse of history, it beats back the curse's impact substantially. We provide experimental results and chart future work.",0
"Matching two texts is a fundamental problem in many natural language processing tasks. An effective way is to extract meaningful matching patterns from words, phrases, and sentences to produce the matching score. Inspired by the success of convolutional neural network in image recognition, where neurons can capture many complicated patterns based on the extracted elementary visual patterns such as oriented edges and corners, we propose to model text matching as the problem of image recognition. Firstly, a matching matrix whose entries represent the similarities between words is constructed and viewed as an image. Then a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture rich matching patterns in a layer-by-layer way. We show that by resembling the compositional hierarchies of patterns in image recognition, our model can successfully identify salient signals such as n-gram and n-term matchings. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority against the baselines.",1
"Standard algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph require that the cost of a path be additive in edge costs, and typically assume that costs are deterministic. We consider the problem of uncertain edge costs, with potential probabilistic dependencies among the costs. Although these dependencies violate the standard dynamic-programming decomposition, we identify a weaker stochastic consistency condition that justifies a generalized dynamic-programming approach based on stochastic dominance. We present a revised path-planning algorithm and prove that it produces optimal paths under time-dependent uncertain costs. We test the algorithm by applying it to a model of stochastic bus networks, and present empirical performance results comparing it to some alternatives. Finally, we consider extensions of these concepts to a more general class of problems of heuristic search under uncertainty.",0
"Training deep neural networks is a highly nontrivial task, involving carefully selecting appropriate training algorithms, scheduling step sizes and tuning other hyperparameters. Trying different combinations can be quite labor-intensive and time consuming. Recently, researchers have tried to use deep learning algorithms to exploit the landscape of the loss function of the training problem of interest, and learn how to optimize over it in an automatic way. In this paper, we propose a new learning-to-learn model and some useful and practical tricks. Our optimizer outperforms generic, hand-crafted optimization algorithms and state-of-the-art learning-to-learn optimizers by DeepMind in many tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on a number of tasks, including deep MLPs, CNNs, and simple LSTMs.",1
"Existential rules have been proposed for representing ontological knowledge, specifically in the context of Ontology- Based Data Access. Entailment with existential rules is undecidable. We focus in this paper on conditions that ensure the termination of a breadth-first forward chaining algorithm known as the chase. Several variants of the chase have been proposed. In the first part of this paper, we propose a new tool that allows to extend existing acyclicity conditions ensuring chase termination, while keeping good complexity properties. In the second part, we study the extension to existential rules with nonmonotonic negation under stable model semantics, discuss the relevancy of the chase variants for these rules and further extend acyclicity results obtained in the positive case.",0
"We study the problem of probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events. We show that globally complete probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events is NP-hard. We then concentrate on the special case of probabilistic deduction in conditional constraint trees. We elaborate very efficient techniques for globally complete probabilistic deduction. In detail, for conditional constraint trees with point probabilities, we present a local approach to globally complete probabilistic deduction, which runs in linear time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. For conditional constraint trees with interval probabilities, we show that globally complete probabilistic deduction can be done in a global approach by solving nonlinear programs. We show how these nonlinear programs can be transformed into equivalent linear programs, which are solvable in polynomial time in the size of the conditional constraint trees.",0
"This paper explores the contributions of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to the study of an established theory from the field of Second Language Acquisition: Input Processing. The theory describes default strategies that learners of a second language use in extracting meaning out of a text, based on their knowledge of the second language and their background knowledge about the world. We formalized this theory in ASP, and as a result we were able to determine opportunities for refining its natural language description, as well as directions for future theory development. We applied our model to automating the prediction of how learners of English would interpret sentences containing the passive voice. We present a system, PIas, that uses these predictions to assist language instructors in designing teaching materials. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",0
"In the context of contemporary monophonic music, expression can be seen as the difference between a musical performance and its symbolic representation, i.e. a musical score. In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are almost as popular as the human performed ones.",0
"Students opting engineering as their disciple is increasing rapidly. But due to various factors and inappropriate primary education in India dropout rates are high. Students are unable to excel in core engineering subjects which are complex and mathematical, hence mostly get drop / keep term (kt) in that subject. With the help of data mining techniques we can predict the performance of students in terms of grades and dropout for a subject. This paper compares various techniques such as na\""ive Bayes, LibSVM, J48, random forest, and JRip and try to choose one of them as per our needs and their accuracy. Based on the rules obtained from this technique(s), we derive the key factors influencing student performance.",0
